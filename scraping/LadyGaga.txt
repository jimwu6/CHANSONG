[Verse 1]
I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause inside, we are really made the same (Oh)
In life, waiting's just a stupid game (Oh)

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)

[Verse 2]
I'd do anything for you to really see me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall


[Pre-Chorus]
I cry more than I ever say (Oh)
Each time, your love seems to save the day (Oh)

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)

[Bridge]
I've been hurting, stuck inside a cage
So hard my heart's been in a rage
If you love me, then just set me free
And if you don't, then baby, leave
Set me free

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves


[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)

Lift me up, just a small nudge

[Post-Chorus]
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves

[Verse 2]
I'd do anything if you would just believe me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall
If I had a painter's mind, then I would paint it
Or a sculptor's hands, then I would shape it
But instead, I guess I'll sing it in this song


[Pre-Chorus]
I cry more than I ever sang
Each time, your love seems to save the day

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves

What them other ladies kill for
Get you out the hood
Raise your babies in the hills shorty
Broke bitches break dollars
Pop bottles still poor
Take you out the door and
Take you on a world tour

They hate us 'cause they ain't us and
They ain't us 'cause they ain't shit
Shorty's a grenade
And her man ain't paid shit
Everybody's flashing new profile pics
I could get you paparazzied
Put you into Page Six, bitch


[Hook 2]
Have you ever seen your name in lights?
Maybe that could change tonight
Have you ever seen a start so bright?
Baby, let me change your life

The movies, TV, TMZ, basics
Face down shake them hips when the bass hits
Salt lime rocks make the shots feel painless
Your man make you sick, ma?
I can make you famous

[Hook 2]
Have you ever seen your name in lights?
Maybe that could change tonight
Have you ever seen a start so bright?

[Intro: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, & Both]
Back in that ass
Yeah
Your mom says hi, jinx!

[Bridge: Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
A-y-y-yeah, a-y-y-yeah
A-y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jam!

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, & Both]
Summertime in the city
And everybody's having sex
You know, I just got a page from a girl
That I met last week at the Payless (ShoeSource)
I also have a cutie to call
Who loves the way I knock on her boots
Well, it's time to mack, let's handle that
In two to six hours, we'll meet back and regroup
Now, let's shoop
Roll up to her crib with some Bartles and James
Hop off the bus with the Alize
Now hold up, playa, what you diggity-doin' here?
I should diggity-ask you the same
Then she sang


[Verse 2: Lady Gaga, Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake]
Hey, boys, I want you both
I hope that you think that's cool (Say word?)
I know most guys won't freak together
But she forgot about the golden rule
Ah-ah-ah!

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake]
It's okay when it's in a 3-way
It's not gay when it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle, there's some leeway
The area's grey in a 1-2-3-way

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, Andy & Justin, & (All)]
Normally, I don't get down with dudes
But tonight is a special exception (Great!)
See, you're my best friend through thick and thin
(Now it's time to make a triple connection)
Lights off!

[Verse 4: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, & Andy & Justin]
Here in the dark (Here in the dark)
It's hard to tell (So hard to tell)
Where her body ends (La la)
And my homie's begins (Ooh-wee)
This rule dates back (The golden rule)
To Ancient Greece (Talking about Caesar)
We're two Jack Trippers and a Chrissy
The new Three's Company!


[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Justin Timberlake & Lady Gaga]
It's okay when it's in a 3-way
It's not gay when it's in a 3-way
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway
The area's grey in a 1-2-3-way

[Bridge: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, & Lady Gaga]
Fellas, get ready
To impress a chick: helicopter dick, go!
Helicopter dick (Uh!), helicopter dick (Alright!)
To impress a chick, do the helicopter dick (Wow!)

[Chorus: Andy Samberg, Justin Timberlake, & Lady Gaga]
And all of that was okay, 'cause it was in a 3-way
It's quite clear when you see the instant replay
Maybe two is enough, that's what they'll say
But we'll say "Hell no," 1-2-3 way

[Outro: All & Andy Samberg]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The Golden Rule

Turnin' up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases

Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save 'em 'til I know I'm gon' drop this

It's not real, but I'll try to grab it
Keep myself in beautiful places
Paradise is in my hands

Need a 911, can you patch the line?

Pop a 911, then pop another one (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)

[Chorus]
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
You gotta a lot, a lot of nerve
Comin' here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you
It isn't fair
Born March of '86
My birthday's comin', and if I had one wish
Yeah, you'd be it

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're 'round, I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me...

[Chorus]
Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop, oh

[Verse 2]
He never really saw me or waited
When we were hookin' up, yeah, he'd a never... last
Last week when I was sad
You said that you knew my eyes changed from kinda green to kinda blue, hey!

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're 'round, I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me...

[Chorus]
Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop, oh

[Outro]
They tell me
If I leave him, baby, would you be there?
'Cause maybe, you could be m-m-mine all the t-t-time


[Intro]
I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro...

[Verse 1]
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro


[Interlude]
Stop, please, just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go

[Verse 2]
She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose

[Outro]
I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro...




Don't ask me 'bout tomorrow
Or tell me 'bout my past
My heart is yours to borrow
Ain't nothin' meant to last

I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

Don't ask too many questions
You don't want answers to
You don't like my direction
Hell, I won't follow you

I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

I told my dyin' daddy that I had to run away
Looked him in the eye
Said there ain't no other way
So woman if I tell you that I love you, be okay

Cause I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

I love you in the mornin' and when the day is done
But if you want my freedom you know I'm bound to run

I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

I told my dyin' daddy that I had to run away
Looked him in the eye
Said there ain't no other way
So woman if I tell you that I love you, be okay

Cause I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

Set me free (Ah-ah-ah)

Could you pull me out of this alive?
(Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah)
Where's my body? I'm stuck in my mind
(Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh ma-ma-ma, oh ma-ma-ma)
I'm tired of screaming

At the top of my lungs
(Oh my mother, oh my mother)
I'm in the hole, I'm falling down, down
So down, down

My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland

Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland

[Verse 2]
Sick and tired of waking up
Screaming at the top of my lungs
Think I might've just left myself behind
Maestro, play me your symphony
I will listen to anything
Take me on a trip, DJ, free my mind

[Chorus]
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland

[Verse 1]
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Verse 2]
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way


[Bridge]
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah

[Outro]
When you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

[Outro]
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm

[Verse 1]
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes

Dreams of you and me are in the dirt
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Intro]
I met a girl in East LA
In floral shorts as sweet as May
She sang in eights in two Barrio chords
We fell in love
But not in court

[Interlude]
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

[NYADA STUDENTS]
Aah-America


[Verse 1]
I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Verse 2]
Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired down the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around?

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down




[Intro]
Meow!

[Verse 1]
You have got a wild side
You're an animal tonight
I see that you are my type
Wild like a tiger hunting your prey
We'll keep the neighbors up all night
Hot in the jungle, exotic apparel

Won't tame you, love the way you're watching me

Hold me down and take control (mess up my hair, all crazy sexual)
Do it like an animal (hot in the jungle, exotic apparel)

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows
Anything goes

[Verse 2: Tony Bennett]
Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

[Chorus 1: Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga, both]
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today, and day's night today
And black's white today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos
And though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When we propose
Anything goes
Go!
Go!

[Chorus 2: Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga, both]
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today, and day's night today
And black's white today

And though we're not such great romancers
We know that you're bound to answer
When we propose
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes

[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV
Baby, could I bear being away from you
I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause

[Verse 2]
I've overheard your theory "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
(When the lights are meant to die
I know it's worth waiting for
When the lights are meant to die
I know it's worth waiting for

Come to me, in all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you

Give it time, sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose, can rescue you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP

Come to me, with all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lover's kites, are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose, can profit you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything


Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP

Brushes with darknes won't help you create
Your destiny of self but ARTPOP could mean anything, anything
I try to sell myself but I am really laughing
Because I just want the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)

[Verse 1]
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura?


[Verse 2]
Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

[Bridge]
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the curtain, behind the burqa

Faster than you can try to hate it
You can try to hate it
You can try to fake it
But baby, I laced it

You can serve it to me, ancient-city style
We can party like it's B.C.
With a pretty sixteenth-century smile

[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy

[Post-Chorus]
(Bad decisions that we made)
I'm the bad guy
(Bad decisions that we made)

Caught in a bad romance

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You're the bad guy




[Intro]
We don't care what people say, we know the truth
Enough is enough of this horse shit
I am not a freak, I was born with my free gun
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom

[Verse 1]
I'm a bitch
I'm a loser, baby, maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money, but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
Till they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)

[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

[Verse 2]
I'm a twit
Degenerate, young rebel and I'm proud of it
Pump your fist if you would rather mess up than put up with this
I'm a nerd
I chew gum and smoke in your face, I'm absurd
I'm so bad
And I don't give a damn, I love it when you're mad
When you're mad, when you're mad

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)

[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

[Bridge]
I'm not that typical baby
I'm a bad kid like my mom and dad made me
I'm not that "cool and you hate me"
I'm a bad kid, that's the way that they made me
I'm a bad kid, I'm disastrous
Give me your money or I'll hold my breath
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
One of the bad kids don't know wrong from right

[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby

[Outro]
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby

It's gotten ugly, they passed the 15th
Still, women had no right nor guarantee
To liberty
Child, health, wealth or property (hey!)
We'll raise our banner across this land, (hey!)
'Cause franchise isn't just a right of a man
Universal
Yeah yeah it's Universal (yeah yeah it's Universal)

I'm queen of my home, raise my babies, that's it
Don't need to vote
No no, she don't want to vote
No, no, no, don't want to vote

Freedom: it is contagious
March, march, be courageous!
Fighting for our right, we may just
Start greatness for the ages

Not to be above, but equal to all men
We only ask to be part of this Union

[Verse 1]
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus 1]
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

[Verse 2]
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

[Chorus 2]
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
I used to shoot you down

[Bridge]
Music played and people sang
Not for me not church bells ring

[Verse 3]
Now he's gone I don't know why
Until this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

[Chorus 3]
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, he hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
My baby shot me down

Pornographic dance fight
Systematic, honey

Our hair is perfect while we're all getting shit-wrecked
It's automatic, honey

I was frightened when I made it
They called me in
Walked in through the door
They called me weird
Bitch, now I'm a household name

[Chorus]
You've seen the power that I've held
Beauty isn't in the eye of the beholder
It's how you see yourself
You've seen the power that I've held
Now you're about to see what I do next
[...]

[Verse 1]
I can't believe the things you said
Right now, I wish that you would try
Try to stay near me
Try to be near me
Before I cry
Cause I am gonna need a well
To catch the pain and lift the spell
Like you won't hear me
Can you try and hear me?
Before I cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry up hurry up (Hurry up)
Before I lose you
Hurry up, hurry up (Hurry up)
Woah, woah
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up
Woah, woah
Before I change my mind

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna cry if you say you don't need me
I'm gonna cry if you act like you don't care
Promise me, baby, you know I can't fake it
Why don't you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry


[Verse 2]
Could you please find another way?
I start to think that I'm insane
Tryin' to stay here
Let me just lay here
Before I cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry up hurry up (Hurry up)
Before I lose you
Hurry up, hurry up (Hurry up)
Woah, woah
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up (Hurry up)

Woah woah

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna cry if you say you don't need me
I'm gonna cry if you act like you don't care (Don't care)
Promise me, baby, you know I can't fake it
Why don't you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry


[Bridge]
I'm 'bout to lose it
It's got so confusin'
Am I just repeatin' myself?
Say somethin' lovin' to me before I crumble
Tell me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna cry if you say you don't need me
I'm gonna cry if you act like you don't care (Don't care)
Promise me, baby, you know I can't fake it

[Outro]
Have I said what I needed to say?
Have you said what you wanted to say?
Did you say what you wanted to say?
Would you try and stop me
Before I cry?

Back in the day, when you were young (It was fun)

[Lady Gaga]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock
I'mma break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Lady Gaga]
I am a human who's probably gonna fault again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe


[Chorus 1]
Black eyes open wide
It's time to testify
There's no room for lies
And everyone's waitin' for you

[Verse 1]
And I'm gone sittin' by the phone and I'm all alone by the wayside
And I'm gone sittin' by the phone and I'm all alone by the wayside

[Refrain]
By the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside

[Bridge]
Too far gone and I'm by the phone
And I'm all alone and I'm awful lonely by the wayside

I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside

By the wayside
By the wayside
By the wayside


I'm by the wayside
By the wayside
By the wayside

[Chorus 2]
Black eyes open wide
It's time to testify
There's no room for lies

Everyone's lookin' at you
Everyone's lookin' at you
Everyone's waiting for you
Everyone's waiting for you

[Verse 1]
I grew up in New York City
Since I was born on Broadway, baby
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen
To start a new life on the New York scene

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no way I could be stopped
Was taking my best shot
I had a better plan
There's no way I could be stopped
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man

[Chorus]
Amen

Dancing in my revelation
Underground pop civilization
Concrete poetry to feed my mind
Old symbolism was left behind

There's no way I could be stopped
Was coming for your spot

What you 'gon do when you can't fight
Anymore for the limelight?

When they judgin, judgin' rules

[Verse 1]
Pills and potions meant for two
Smoke and shadows fill the room
Herbs and spirits join us too
Psyche ain't got nothing on you
Achilles meets Patroclus
Aphrodite's one true kiss
Every time its hit or miss
Cemeteries filled by this

[Pre-Chorus]
I still feel you when I'm all alone
I stare at the stars and only think of you
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do
Why do they keep taking me away from you

[Chorus]
I can feel your shadows in my room
Tarot cards won't make me bulletproof
My soulmate, twin-flame, whatever thy name
When player one met player two, you fell for me, I jumped for you
I can feel your shadows in my room
Tarot cards won't make me bulletproof
My soulmate, twin-flame, whatever thy name
When player one met player two, you fell for me, I jumped for you

Let's play a love game, play a love game

Do you want love, do you want fame
Let's play a love game, play a love game

[Verse 2]
I can't tell what time it is
Is this life real or a matrix
Without you, I can't exist
If life's a game, we're the glitch

[Pre-Chorus]
I still feel you when I'm all alone
I stare at the stars and only think of you
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do
Why do they keep taking me away from you

[Chorus]
I can feel your shadows in my room
Tarot cards won't make me bulletproof
My soulmate, twin-flame, whatever thy name

When player one met player two, you fell for me, I jumped for you

-Dancin' in circle-

It's f hot in Roblox
Look at that costume *points little monster* you are delicious darling
Thank you so much to my beautiful, loyal, amazing fans, you are so filled with talent and joy. I'm so glad all the time...
That's a very little monster in there *points fan* Hello! I can see you ;)

You know, did anybody get to go to the artr*ve? That was a party
Oh you know, that was my last tour, the artr*ave
And, when I went on tour, I went to my home, which is the first first home I've ever had, huh

And I walked around and I said, what am I gonna do now, in this house? Am I gonna write more music?
And I'm gonna go on tour again, 'cause that's really what I want to do
And I thought what am I gonna write about? I want so badly to relate to people that haven't related to me yet, not because I'm
You know, don't love the fans I have but I think it's important you know to grab somebody else's f* hat and try to walk in their sh* for a little while
So I made sure this album, Joanne, that I didn't just honor the more personal sentiments
I made sure also to honor the h** in my heart
The trap of my spirit
You know one day, I'm gonna have a kid in one arm and a glass of Pxnot Grigio in the other

And as long as I keep dancin' in circles it'll feel real good to be lonely. LET'S GO!


[Intro]
Tap down those boots while I. *spin around the circle*
Hands up, lets go ! *waves*
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

[Verse 1]
I lay around, touch myself to pass the time. *tcuch myself*
I feel down, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes. *spin*
Take a breath and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize, cmon !

[Pre-Chorus]
In the fire I call your name out
*dances*
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out


[Chorus]
I'm singin': Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry *remove the clip*
I'm singin': Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lone-ly. *spin*


[Post-Chorus]
*spin*
*dances*
Funk me downtown

[Verse 2]
I fool myself. Hands up !
Swirl around as if I'm someone else
Your hands are mine
I do a trick, pretend that I am you until it clicks
I come alive, come alive


[Pre-Chorus]
In the fire I call your name out
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out

[Chorus]
I'm singin': Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry

Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown!
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown!

[Bridge]
Hurts inside, but not this time. *poses*
All the things that are on my mind
Vanish as I tcuch myself. *waves*
Call out loud for you
Oh, can you hear me singin'?

[Chorus]
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
DANCIN' IN CIRCLES, FEELS GOOD TO BE LONELY !

-Angel Down-

[Verse 1]
I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Verse 2]
Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred?
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around?

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Bridge]
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Outro]

-Joanne-

*gets guitar*
*sits*

We're very honored tonight that my latest album 'Joanne' is number 8 in United States. Thank you! :)

And I just want to take a, take a little poll here. Don't worry about it, it's not gonna offend me, I just wanna know, how many of you here tonight in the audience don't know who Joanne is?
Oh. I think many people are a bit lost
But, if you do know who Joanne is, that's amazing
And for those of you wondering tonight, you might be saying, who's Joanne? *laughs*
And that person, Joanne, is two things. Number 1, my middle name is Joanne, given to me by my parents
But Joanne, was also the name of my father's sister who I was named after. She died in 1974 of lupus
This loss of my family, it travelled decades and generations that I thought she would be like an angel, from the dinner table
I thought of her and my parents at night, and I study her, so that I might be able to understand my father
So when I asked of all of you tonight, it's even the joyest moment that we get to spend all together, knowing I know
And many of you know that there are people all over the world they could never afford to go see a live show like this, you are all so very lucky
And as we got time to ask you, I would ask you to honor your own pain in this moment, and take yourself back to that place where you were blasted and your life was changed so much
So much that you don't even remember who you were before

For me, that pain has only one name, and it's Joanne

*whispers* one, two, three
*plays guitar*

Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not ready for you...

Girl, where do you think you're going, where do you think you're going, going girl?
Girl, where do you think you're going! Girl


We both know, things don't work that way
I promised I, wouldn't say goodbye, so I grin, and my voice gets thin

Girl, where do you think you're going?

Honestly I know where you're going

And I'll still love you even if I can't see you anymore. Can't wait to see you soar

Joanne middle stop speech:
Hello gentlemen
I guess what I'm trying to say is I was trying to figure out myself a little better, and, instead of just staring at myself
I tried to figure out my dad, and my mom, and their pain. And it led me right back home

*sits*
*whispers* one, two, three

*plays guitar*

Girl, where do you think you're going, where do you think you're going, going girl!
Girl, where do you think you're going, where do you think you're going, going, gi-oh-rl!

Call me Joanne

Xo Joanne

XoXo all our pain, makes us this way, it made me who I am

Joanne

This is the manifesto of Mother Monster:

On GOAT, a government owned territory in space, a birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place. But the birth was not finite, it was infinite. As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began it was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal. And thus began the beginning of the new race; a race within the race of humanity; a race which bears no prejudice, no judgment but boundless freedom. But on that same day as the eternal Mother hovered in the multiverse another, more terrifying, birth took place: the birth of evil

And as she, herself, split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces, the pendulum of choice began its dance. It seems easy, you imagine, to gravitate, instantly and unwaveringly, towards good but she wondered, "How can I protect something so perfect without evil?"

I was born this way

[Breakdown]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby, you were born this way

[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave!


[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Outro]
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

[Chorus]
I was born this way
I was born this way

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital "H"im
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Way)
(Same DNA)

Boys like you love me forever

(verse 1)
I'm feeling speechless, like a mute dude with secrets, forced to keep it/
The mind of a mime but it's for a reason, cuz every time I'm on my grind is when I find the leeches/ and they just wanna drain me of my energy/ get what they can get from me/ and the minute I Fall, is When(wind) they leave(leaf)/ some a (Summer) get it but most didn't/ some see the big picture some up close and still squinting/ I'M HANGING OUT THE WINDOW OF THAT YOKAN/ SAYING FUCK THE WORLD UNTIL I HAVE A NEW BORN/ THAT'S THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS THAT I DEAL WITH/ I'M UNTOUCHABLE SO DON'T EXPECT YOU TO FEEL THIS/ I'M UP 4 IN THE MORNING LIKE IT'S THE AFTERNOON/ MY FAMILY WORRIED LIKE "WHAT THE FUCK HAPPEN TO HIM"/ DEALING WITH INNER DEMONS GOTTA FIGHT EM OFF/ SO I LOAD UP QUIET WEAPONS WHEN STEPPING IN SILENT WARS/ THIS IS REAL

(Hook)
I'll never talk again, I'll never talk again. baby you, baby you gave up, baby baby you

(VERSE 2)
Depression will mess up your home like a house fire/ be with your family and feeling like an outsider/ my son like "dad why you so quiet" and I replied when you get older you gon know why/  the struggle of juggling bills/ and dealing with women you thought love you for real/ I know that's your mother but she be bugging when she don't got her pills/ and I'm same when I ain't got a cup of liquor to spill/ THAT'S WHY I SPARK ANOTHER CIGARETTE/ A NIGGA STRESSED, KEEP YOUR TRUTH COMMERCIALS AND NICORETTE/ CUZ I AIN'T FINISHED YET/ AND I'M FRESH FROM MY GRANDMOTHER'S BURIAL/ TELL PEOPLE THAT I LOVE I'MA CALL THEM BUT I NEVER DO/ SAY TO MYSELF "DAYO YOU AIN'T SHIT"/ THAT'S A HARSH REALITY I WAS ONCE AFRAID TO ADMIT/ LIKE WALKING TO SCHOOL IN BUSHWICK, A BITCH MADE FUN OF ME/ BUMPPED INTO HER AT A CLUB AND NOW SHE WANNA FUCK WITH ME

(outro)
I'll never talk again oh boy you left me speechless, you left me speechless so speechless, I'll never love again. baby you gave up

[Verse 1]
I always thought it was you
You always thought it was me
We always thought we were it
Seemed like a real perfect fit
Those Brooklyn nights set us free
I always thought even though
We were so young, we could grow
Up in the end, it'd be us
We'd take the F by the bus
Where Brooklyn nights set us free

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Verse 2]
I missed our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV
The one where the Russians scored?
I love Briggite Nielsen's hair
I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open the last beer
Falling asleep in our tears
Those Brooklyn nights set us free


[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Bridge]
I found an old pair of keys in my purse
That opened the walk up we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there, I wanna make it work
I didn't brush my hair and my lashes are falling off
Of seven years of our bad luck dating
I want our last night there, a Brooklyn night affair
A Brooklyn night affair

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Outro]
It's not that I don't wanna love you 'cause I really tried and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu
Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'll both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu



Out September 1, 2018


[Intro]
It's in time with it

[Verse 1]
In your brown eyes, I walked away
In your brown eyes, I couldn't stay
In your brown eyes, you'll watch her go
Then turn the record on and wonder what went wrong
What went wrong?

[Chorus 1]
If everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes

[Verse 2]
In your brown eyes, I was feeling low
'Cause the brown eyes, and you never know
Got some brown eyes, but I saw her face
I knew that it was wrong
So baby, turn the record on
Play that song

[Chorus 1]
Where everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes
Brown eyes


[Chorus 2]
Everything was everything, but baby it's the last show
Everything could be everything, but it's time to say goodbye
So get your last fix, and your last hit
Grab your old girl with her new tricks
Honey, yeah, it's no surprise that I got lost in your brown eyes
In your brown eyes

[Outro]
Brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes
Brown, brown eyes
Got some brown eyes
Brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes

[Intro]
I killed my boyfriend and
Left him in the trunk on highway 10
Put the knife under the hood
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood

Burqa

[Verse 1]
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?


[Verse 2]
Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

[Breakdown]
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the Burqa?
Behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa, behind the Burqa?

Love is funny, or it's sad
Or it's quiet, or it's mad
It's a good thing, or it's bad
But beautiful, beautiful
To take a chance
And if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking
I wouldn't mind at all

[Lady Gaga]:
Love is tearful, or it's gay
It's a problem, or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful, and I'm thinking
If you were my mine I'd never let you go

[Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga]:
And that would be but beautiful

- Can't Crush On Your Sour Love -

Verse I

Don't look at me with your damn eyes
Just help me stand up
Seriously it hurts (literally)
I wonder when holding hands
Why did you put gum in between?
Maybe you want dirty love

But I suck! (seriously)
I  just want ordinary love
Not a drunken drug but sweet love
And that's what you don't offer

Chorus

Oh no no no no
Can you pop it ?
And stop your hand dancing on my f*ckin'
I hate it shit !
Oh no no no no
I can't have a crush on your sour love
Iam not hooked
Just eat your own sour fruit that
Stop pleas 911 call
Stop pleas 911 call
Stop pleas 911 call
Can't have a crush on your sour love


Verse II

Please stay away from me
I can jump from the burj of the Caliph
And you will only get my fresh blood
And I will possess you and make you kill yourself

But I suck! (seriously)
I  just want ordinary love
Not a drunken drug but sweet love
And that's what you don't offer

Chorus II

Oh no no no no
Can you pop it ?
And stop your hand dancing on my f*ckin'

[Verse 1]
One look, and I'm done
One glance from your eyes, and I'm captivated
The taste of your skin
The warmth of your hungry lips
Has me so taken, and I...

[Chorus 1]
Love the way you can make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you, I'm so sedated
I'm captivated by you

[Verse 2]
You're just like the wind
'Cause everything moves away when you're around it
The sun is just like the sound of your voice in the morning
When you light my world up, and I...

[Chorus 2]
Love the way you can make me dance from miles away
When I'm with you, I'm never jaded
I'm captivated

[Bridge]
Oh, I'll never stop believing in this crazy love we're leading
Oh, sugar, hold me closer and make me sweeter
I need you
I love you

[Breakdown]
So, please, show me that smile
Make me laugh for just a little while
Then breathe me one breath
I only need one to fill the emptiness, and I...

[Chorus 3]
Love the way you can make me dance from miles away
It's been so long, but now I've waited
And I'm captivated




Lord I love you Carolina
I like you beach and your beer
I park my bus up on the levee
Next to a sandy pier
I like your waves and your women
I like to dance all night
If my baby doesn't love me
I'm going to Carolina tonight

Carolina
Carolina
If my baby doesn't love me
I'm going to Carolina tonight

I'll give her two more hours
To let her clear her head
I'm gonna roll me up a number
Waiting naked in bed
I'll take my Texas time
Because I'm feeling alright
Well, if my baby doesn't love me
I'm going to Carolina tonight

Carolina
Carolina
If my baby doesn't love me
I'm going to Carolina tonight

Carolina
Carolina
Carolina

Carolina
Carolina
Well, if my baby doesn't love me
I'm going to Carolina tonight

[Verse 1]
I need somebody who calls my name
When clouds are smokin up my way
You get me through these cha-changing skies
I don't wanna be afraid again
It's just that I could use a friend
You get me through these cha-changing skies

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me something that I can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-iow
Believe me when I say that I will be okay
And listen, there's some voice and my cha-changing skies

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna be the kind to cry
I wanna dance right through the night
You get me through these cha-changing skies
Know that I am not emotional
It's just that I don't wanna fall without my parachute, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me something that I can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-iow
Believe me when I say that I will be okay
And listen, there's some voice and my cha-changing skies

[Chorus]
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing

"Charlotte Nights" is a unreleased song written by Lady Gaga during The Monster Ball Tour




[Intro: Lady Gaga]
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

[Tony Bennett:]
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gamblers lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

[Verse 1: Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga]
Oh, I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak (me too!)
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh, I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

[Hook: Both]
Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

[Bridge:]
To heaven, yes, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Go!

[Hook: Both]
Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

[Outro: Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga]
To heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
Oh baby, when we're out together dancing
Out together dancing
Out together dancing cheek to cheek


[Chorus 1: Lady Gaga & Wale]
Look at, lookin' at, lookin' at me

Stuntin' in some other Jordan Nines

Let's talk about the cars y'all got
You say you got a lotta whips, well I got a lot
I got the right to be cocky
Get so much cut disc jockeys jock me
You niggas mad cause you not me
I remain a giant while you're Jeremy Shockey
And if you ain't heard me properly
If you speak garbage, then we no capiche
DC chillin', PG chillin', floor To the ceilin'
Stuntin' in my Billionaire gear on my
Millionaire frames, that's money on my mind, Wale

[Chorus 2: Lady Gaga]
Get 'em all, get 'em all, pick it all up
Stack up your funds like a million bucks
Across the pond, they all know us

Lookin' at me, now they know my face
We want it all now, we got it all, yesss
Look at that, look how they lookin' at usss

[Verse 2: Wale]
They keep sayin' whale, but my name Wale
Hoes call me "Mr. Never-Wear-The Same-Thing"
You redundant, You never ever change
And I'm the same way, M.I.A
And me, Cool & Dre gettin' high like planes
Your man Wale in his own damn lane
Can't control the box, you are no Mills Lane
Ain't heard DC since Sardines came
Ha! And I made y'all love it
We don't cop pleas, but y'all don't cop nothin'
Police come around don't nobody say nothin'
And you be with the cops, you niggas is McLovin
Dark liquor 'til we busted
'Til I got a buzz like that nigga Chris Mullin
District of Columbia
You Bernie Mac funny, we ain't scared of none of ya

[Chorus 2: Lady Gaga & Wale]
Get 'em all, get 'em all, pick it all up
Stack up your funds like a million bucks

Haters in the crowd, if you see 'em, point them out
Stacks in my jeans, broads on the scene
Folarin be ballin' for all y'all to see
Ain't I something? The way I'm stuntin'
My material girls give 'em A-Rod Moneyyy!
LV on my luggage
Them Bammas goin' hate, and I love it

[Chorus 1: Lady Gaga & Wale]

Look at that, look how they lookin' at me
Eyes all stickin' Like honey on bees
Look At that, Look how they lookin' at me

Came to get it, came to get It
My name Wale

Keep repeating self-hating phrases

Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again

Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)

Water like misery
It's coming down on me

Oh, but at least we try, we try
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Lady Gaga]
I can feel it on my skin (It's comin' down on me)
Teardrops on my face (Water like misery)
Let it wash away my sins (It's coming down on me)
Let it wash away, yeah

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive

Freak out, I freak out, look at me now

Everybody's got to love each other
Stop throwin' stones at your sisters and your brothers

The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in

She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still kills the dance

[Chorus]
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won't walk away, but she won't look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess

She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still kills the dance

Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

I close my eyes
Take a breath and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize

Pretend that I am you until it clicks

Burnin' up this town
Spendin' everythin' I've saved
Yeah
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave

[Verse 2: Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga]
Every little lie you tell can't keep it hid

Diggin' my grave, yeah

[Chorus: Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga]
So keep on runnin' around

All these tears I cry
Drownin' in a tidal wave
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave

[Verse 1]
It's too much a mess and a stress to figure out
And too much pressure on us, babe
Last night you took me to the mall
And then it started to get physical

[Pre-Chorus]
But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

[Chorus]
Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

[Verse 2]
I can't live with you, yes it's true
Or live without the kind of guy that I'm about
You kiss me like a rockstar
And you always wanna hold my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

[Chorus]
Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

[Breakdown]
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Don't be, don't be

[Chorus]
Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

[Verse 1]
Inside my heart
We have a brand new start
But you wanna keep us apart
It's not fun being me
My secret's disappearing
You'll know what I'll be hearing
Everyone's inside my toybox
Everyone wants to stalk my little toybox
If you weren't born with it
You can buy a couple ornaments
Just be sure to read the warning, kids
'Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it, ha-ha
Sexual, hey girl, if you wanna feel sexual
You can always call up a professional
They stick pins in you like a vegetable, ha-ha
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah
Old suitcase, clean getaway
I'm the one who takes the blame again
New day but the same lines
I feel like a victim of the dollar sign
Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel
Step one
You must accept that I'm a little out my mind
Step two
This is a waste if you can't walk me down the finish line
Step three
Give me passion, don't make fun of my fashion
Step four
Give me more, give me more, more
If you can't handle a heart like mine
Don't waste your time with me
If you're not down to bleed, no, oh
If you can't handle the choking, the biting
The loving, the smothering
'Til you can't handle it no more, no more
Go home
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here


[Outro]
Please, please
Don't leave me
Be
It's not true
Take me to the rooftop
Told you not to worry
What do you want from me?
Don't ask questions
Wait a minute
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
Baby, I don't feel so good
And all the good girls go to Hell
Bite my tongue, bide my time
What is it about them?
I'm the bad guy

[Intro]
I am so fab
Check out:
I'm blonde, I'm skinny
I'm rich, and I'm a little bit of a bitch

[Verse 1]
I wanna dress you up in silk
Taffeta
Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt
What's your size?
This purse can hold my black card
And tiara
Versace promises I will
Dolce Vita

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

[Chorus]
Donatella!
(I'm smoking 'em on full tank of gas)
Mi-Mi-Bella
(I'm a rich bitch, I'm the upper class)
All of the day
(I'm the pearl to your oyster, I'm a babe)
I'm gonna smoke Marlboro Lights and drink Champagne
(I smoke Marlboro Reds and drink Champagne)

[Post-Chorus]
Donatella!
'Cause she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she's misunderstood
Voodoo, voodoo
Voo-don-na-na

[Verse 2]
Walk down the runway, but don't puke
It's okay
You just had a salad today
Boulangerie
Just ask your gay friends their advice
Before you...
Get a spray tan on holiday
In Taipei

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

[Verse 1: Nathan Ferraro]
In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight
Taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face
I've changed my name but no one wants you when you lose

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not beaten yet
Don't give up
I know you can make it good

[Verse 2: Nathan Ferraro]
Though I saw it all around never thought I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born on the lakeside
As daylight broke I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't give up
You still have us
Dont give up
We don't need much of anything
Don't give up 'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
Rest your head
You worry too much
It's gonna be alright
When times get rough you can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up

[Bridge: Nathan Ferraro]
Got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
Gonna stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come and whatever may go
That river's flowing
That river's flowing
Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job so many men
So many men no one needs

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not the only one
Don't give up
No reason to be ashamed
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up
We're proud of who you are
Don't give up 'cause I believe there's a place




Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I am mad
Don't ya know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting foolish things
Some simple things I've done

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, please don't let me be misunderstood


[Verse 1]
Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'll hate myself until I die

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Stay with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

[Post-Chorus]
I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope


[Verse 2]
Toast, one last puff and two last regrets
Three spirits and 12 lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long

I could be the green in your blunt, your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want

Get a lotta views 'cause they know we be the top
Jean Basquiat's in the middle of our hall
Ooh, she's my work of art so I pin her to the wall (haha)
Sex in the dark, underneath the waterfall
High as a space cadet as I'm leapin' over stars
Enemy of the state, they got a target on your boy
(Maybach Music)
'Cause I'm the hottest 'cross the board
Cruise through the ghetto, Mulsanne made of metal
Hangin' out the window, Bruce Willis on the pedal
Pool on the roof, black bottle for a model
I gotta keep it fly
Mosquito doors on the auto
Boss

[Intro: Lady Gaga]
You don't own my life, but...
Life, but, life, but...
Ohh
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I, I feel good
I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up
And then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want about me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Drop: Steven Redant]

[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]
My bones hurt from all the shows, mmm
But I don't feel the pain, 'cause I'm a pro
I, I sink in
Then I'm okay
'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage, hey
Hey
Do what you want, do want you want
Ohh

Do want you want with me

But do what you want with my body

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Christina Aguilera]
You can't have my heart (help me now) and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body

You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body

[Verse 1]
I lay around, touch myself to pass the time
Role around, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes
Hold myself and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize

[Pre-Chorus]
--- out of this cage
When I'm around you I just can't behave

[Chorus]
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
I'm driving in circles, it's hard to be lonely
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

[Intro]
What if I were to leave you
But then you fell back in love with me?

[Verse]
How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my baby
You never made it through to you

[Chorus]
If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

[Verse 1]
My body is sanctuary
My blood is pure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
You want me bad
I think you're cool, but I'm not sure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something more from you
It's not about sex or champagne, you holy fool
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel


[Verse 2]
Confess to me, where you have been
Next to the bar
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Pray for your sins right under the glass disco ball
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something sacred from you
Together, we'll both find a way
To make a pure love work in a dirty way

[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

Oh, oh
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place (Meet me, meet me)
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel
In Electric Chapel



[Verse 1]
We are a generation twisted by a myth
Confused and ludicrous
Holding on to love
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst
A life without the lips we've kissed, and losing all control

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

[Chorus]
Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness
Electric kiss

[Verse 2]
Fame is our felony
We're so in love with it
Some superstars and masochists who don't know where to go
But the poets and the fathers of our time
Put down their weapons in their arms, and know what they must do

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

[Chorus]
Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness
Electric kiss

Tell me, tell me what you see)

[Chorus: Tami Chynn]

[Verse 1]
Well I don't mind sleeping alone
If it means I don't have to play your crazy games no more
You're the most precious thing I've ever seen
But I ain't gonna let it slide when you're mean to me
I know the love that I deserve

[Chorus]
And I hope you find yourself
Before I find somebody else to be my lover
And I hope you find yourself
Before I find somebody else to be my lover

[Verse 2]
Well, you tell me things I wanna hear
You want me near, and I know you feel me leaving you
You think that I won't say goodbye
But baby I ain't standing by while you stretch the truth
I know the love that I deserve

[Chorus]
And I hope you find yourself
Before I find somebody else to be my lover
I said I hope you find yourself
Before I find somebody else to be my lover
I know the love that I deserve


[Bridge]
I know the love that I deserve
Oh, I know the love that I deserve

[Verse 1]
I call her Firefly
Cause, oh, my
She radiates moon glow
Wants none of that noon glow
She starts to glitter
When the sun goes down
Bout eight p.m., it's mayhem
She switches the brights up
Lights up and gives me a call
"Take me to the Fireflies ball"

[Pre-Chorus]
But when I get her there
Set her there
Do I get to pet her there
And grab me some glow

[Hook]
No, she's a gad about, mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

[Verse 2]
Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch onto you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on me

[Pre-Chorus]
[Hook]

[Chorus]
Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch on for you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on
Shine a little light on
Shine a little light on me
(in the mornin')


[Verse 1]
It's been a hard day
Harder night
The rockstar's girlfriend
She lost the fight
Well, it's alright, baby, I'm nobody's mother
When you don't want the last cigerette to be over

[Chorus]
You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of honest lies
Again, oh, and you fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of honest eyes

[Verse 2]
It's been two days since he left home
She dried her eyes
Picked up her microphone
She sang, "It's alright, baby."
I'm nobody's mother
But I dont want this last cigerette to be over

[Chorus]
You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of honest lies
Again, oh, and you fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of honest eyes


[Instrumental Bridge]

[Final Chorus]
You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of effin lies
Again, oh, and fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of shh... eyes
Again, honest, honest, you're so freaking honest
Na-na-na-na-na-na

At least your shh... honest

All the children just clap your hands
Everybody just clap your hands

[Lady Gaga]:
I've always been looking
Been trying, been yearning
Continually seeking
And searching and burning
Exploring and hunting
And everywhere turning
For that power fountain
That fountain of truth

No answers at all in the streets or the mall
I saw it in the ocean, found raging emotion
Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that power fountain
That fountain of truth

[Melle]:
The future is yours
The time is now
The place is here
Shout now
So every kid can hear
So every woman and man in the land can understand the new world
Inherited by the children
Free from famine or disease
That's right
Free from the gun and the knife
Forever, for life
Free from all the mistakes that we made in the past
Throw your hands in the air and let the truth last

[Lady Gaga]:
I've always been looking
Been trying, been yearning
Continually seeking
And searching and burning
Exploring and hunting
And everywhere turning
For that power fountain
That fountain of truth

No answers at all in the streets or the mall
I saw it in the ocean, found raging emotion
Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that power fountain
That fountain of truth

[Melle]:
You got the power
The wind in every hour
To blossom like a flower under the rain shower
The reach like the branch of the tree up in the sky
So reach high and soar with the eagles as we fly
Flight of great heights
Fight the great fights
Strong and sing songs of wrongs just made right
And the never ending search for the fountain of youth
In your youth you're bound to find a fountain of truth

[Lady Gaga]:
I've looked in the city
A place without pity
Seen mountains of wealth
Not fountains of health

Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that powerful fountain
That fountain of the truth

[Melle]:
Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands
And have a ball, y'all
All the children just clap your hands
Everybody just clap your hands
And have a ball, y'all

Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands, (clap your hands)
And have a ball, y'all
Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands
And have a ball, y'all

[Lady Gaga]:
Fountain of truth
Fountain of truth
Fountain of truth

[Verse 1]
I woke up chained inside a vacant little room
Felt like a prisoner of his discretion
I couldn't breathe my lungs were captured by the fumes
My mind was in the arms of his possession

[Pre-Chorus]
Turned off the lights but my aura was bright
Breathed in all the chemicals reborn again
I made my escape broke the windows of fate
No longer an animal take my hand and

[Chorus]
Call me Mother Monster I will be your guide
Send me into the night, night, night
Blame it on the doctor
He went and took a bite of my heart but it brought me to life life, life
Sh-sh-shocked the system twisted every rhythm
Now I'm living the crime, crime, crime
Call me Mother Monster I am not a bride
Just the product of his design
I've been Frankensteined

(Don't call me Gaga
I'm not that girl anymore)

[Verse 2]
Oh, I could think about the soul I used to be
But it's a waste because our time is precious
And as I traveled through the graveyards underneath
Felt like a queen but I'm a crooked princess

[Pre-Chrous]
Turned off the lights but my aura was bright
Breathed in all the chemicals reborn again
I made my escape broke the windows of fate
No longer an animal take my hand and

[Chorus]
Call me Mother Monster
I will be your guide
Send me into the night, night, night
Blame it on the doctor
He went and took a bite of my heart but it brought me to life life,life
Sh-sh-shocked the system twisted every rhythm
Now I'm living the crime, crime, crime
Call me Mother Monster I am not a bride
Just the product of his design
I've been Frankensteined

[Bridge]
The night is young but my spirit's even younger
Lightning and the thunder
The night is young but my spirit's even younger
I can taste the hunger
The night is young but my spirit's even younger
Lightning and the thunder
The night is young but my spirit's even younger
Can you taste the hunger

[Chorus]
Call me Mother Monster I will be your guide
Send me into the night, night, night
Blame it on the doctor he went and took a bite of my heart but it brought me to life, life, life
Sh-sh-shocked the system twisted every rhythm
Now I'm living the crime, crime, crime
Call me Mother Monster I am not a bride
Just the product of his design
I've been Frankensteined
I've been Frankensteined

Now I'm finally alive
I've been Frankensteined


[Chorus]
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek? Then open up the curtains

I wanna know
Yeah, it's alright
New positions, bet you would like
You've been screamin', "Stop, yes, please, hon!"
Baby, you've got tricks in my head
Craziest chick you've ever had

You wanna wear, you wanna mend
I like it rough, I like it fast
I know that deep down you're a freak

'Cause I'm sure you're tired of being certain
Baby, it's a freakshow
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Verse 2]
When you're alone, what do you dream?
I wanna know your fantasy
Don't matter how wrong it might be
I wanna see, know what I mean
Psycho and fun, sexy and mean
It's just different when you're with me
I want it all
I got a spell, put it on you and I won't tell
Your secret, 'cause I am your slave
You want it hard, you want it tough
I like it long, never enough
I promise that I won't behave

[Pre-Chorus]
Just say the magic words and I'll come
I'll hypnotize you
You're gonna lose your mind, don't you know?
Baby, it's a freakshow

Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
'Cause I'm sure you're tired of being certain

[Verse 1]
Making love in an ice cold room
We start 'til the candle burns - gone
Kissing each other 'til the moon says bye-bye
And the sun says hello

[Pre-Chorus]
Lying here with no blanket
The room's temperature is sub-zero
Baby bring your body closer
'Cause you keep me warm when you're naked

[Chorus]
Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Making out in this ice box 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Let's keep on, (keep) on freezin'
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)

[Verse 2}
Sweat drippin' up our bodies, breathin' small
While you're whispering to me
Ice crystal in this small, small bed
But we make frost when we're touching like that

[Pre-Chorus]
Laying here with no blanket
The room's temperature is sub-zero
Baby bring your body closer
'Cause you keep me warm when you're naked


[Chorus]
Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Let's keep on, keep on freezin'
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)

[Bridge]
Snowflakes at the tip of my fingers
Frozen in time, our love lingers
Livin' in a world so cold
Sometimes our hearts are just like icicles

Being with you is all I need
There's nothing we can't handle babe
Lay on my chest, please cover me
Deep frost, on this bed
Memories

[Chorus]
Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Let's keep on, keep on freezin'
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)


Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)
Let's keep on, keep on freezin'
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)



[Verse 1: Jordan Knight]
I see you pulling on up in your car
And there's something on your mind
Like you've been driving around the whole night
Now you're pulling up next to mine
I'll lift the hood and look up under
From the front and to the bumper
Roll the window up and lock the door
'Cause I'm gonna bring rain and thunder

[Pre-Chorus: NKOTB & NE]
I'll fill you up-up (If you wanna get some)
I'll pump you up-up ('Cause I got the premium)
I'll fill you up-up, pump you up-up
'Til the tip-top, drip drop, don't stop, don't stop

You ain't gotta do it yourself, baby
I'ma give you that full service, you'll see

You ain't even gotta get out of your seat

[Verse 2: Ralph Tresvant & ]
I see you pulling up to the bar
And there's something on your mind
Like you've been hanging around the whole night
Just sittin' there sippin' on your wine
I'll pop the cork and fill the glasses
I'll wipe it up if your drink splashes
Send the check my way tonight
You don't pay, 'cause I wanna protect your assets

[Pre-Chorus: NKOTB & NE]
I'll fill you up-up (If you wanna get some)
I'll pump you up-up ('Cause I got the premium)

[Verse 1]
Feelin' something that I can't explain (Oh)
Think it's a wound I still entertain (Oh)
I'd do anything to numb the flame (Oh)
I guess I'm just on fire these days (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see straight, I can't see me
There's too much hurt caught in between
Wish I could be what I know I am
This moment's hijacked my plans

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you (Ooh, ooh)
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too
Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

[Verse 2]
You love the paparazzi, love the fame
Even though you know it causes me pain
I feel like I'm in a prison hell
Stick my hands through the steel bars and yell


[Pre-Chorus]
What happens now? I'm not okay
And if I scream, you walk away
When I'm sad, you just wanna play
I've had enough, why do I stay?

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you (Ooh, ooh)
I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too
Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not havin' fun tonight
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'm not havin' fun tonight

[Chorus]
Yeah, I can see it in your face
You don't think I've pulled my weight
Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

[Verse 1]
I can't help myself
I'm in love
And when I get back from outer space
I'm gonna punch him in his face
He's one
He's a bad, bad boy
Got me twisted, uh
If he's the moon, then I'm eclipsed
I'm so lunar, yeah
When I get to him, run him over with my rocket ship

[Pre-Chorus 1]
My eyeliner runs in constellations for you, dear
If only I could reboot my mechanical heart, I'd think clear

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby, with you I'm a different girl
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love
Baby, could we make a home in the stars?
Baby, somewhere in a galaxy far
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love

[Post-Chorus]
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu-future love?
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future man?
I want to fu-fuck you as hard as I can
Would you put me in your fu-future plans?
I want a fu-fu-fu-future man


[Verse 2]
I've been working and engineering, uh
All our chemistries and our situations
Working out our sex equations
And I know I'm no Nostradamus, yeah
When my hair is blond but my heart's brunette
If I'm not on him then at least I'm honest

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My mascara runs in constellations for you dear, my dear
If only I could space my brain for a minute
I'd think clear

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby, with you I'm a different girl
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love
Baby, could we make a home in the stars?
Baby, somewhere in a galaxy far
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love

[Post-Chorus]
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-fu-future love?
I want your fu-fu-fu-fu-future love
Would you be my fu-fu-fu-future man?
I want to fu-fuck you as hard as I can
Would you put me in your fu-future plans?
I want a fu-fu-fu-future man


[Bridge]
Fuel me up, and take me into a place we've never been
He is so unreal
He's a mannequin
A synthetic, plastic, rubber man
And I'm relying on, on a shooting star
To get to you my future love, ah-ah
He's my rubber hunk, my mechanic guy
And I'm stuck in his metal rubber eyes
Rubber eyes
My future guy

[Outro]
Huh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
I am having a dreams as I lay me down to sleep

[Chorus]
Gaze electronica daze
Beautiful charades
Colors and rage


When we fuck
Changes the weather
When we fuck

I always had
This stupid dream
Of clear thoughts
After THC

Those thoughts were clean
It was weird

It was clear and sunny
Then a cloud came by
The shade of grey
It caught my eye
Followed you
Around like a little spy
Manifested you into my life

I always thought we'd get together
When we fuck changes the weather
When we fuck changes the weather
When we fuck changes the weather
When we fuck changes


I always had
This stupid hope
That ignorance
Was just a joke

It was not worth it
Couldn't cope
You came out of nowhere
A ball of smoke

Toked you up
It made me choke
It seemed like
It would be just a joke
To tuck you in
And hold you close

I always thought we'd get together
Cause when we fuck changes the weather
When we fuck changes the weather
When we fuck changes the weather
When we fuck changes

I always thought we'd get together
Cause when we fuck changes the weather
When we fuck changes the weather
When we fuck changes the weather
When we fuck

[Verse 1: Eve]
Guess you thought you would've been leaving me alone
Like a kid without a daddy, but guess what? I'm fully grown
I can bounce back fast, but that fact you should've known
I was fly before I met you, always make it on my own
Huh, won't lie, I cried, but I knew the pain'll pass
No more living in a lie, 'cause the lies never last
No more thinking you that guy, you just a guy from the past
No more baby talk or wet n' walk, you gonna miss me bad
Man, yeah, well, I guess it's for the best
I guess we'll try to be friends, I guess that'll be a mess
Huh, yeah, then when we hatin' on eachother
It was one time forever, now I guess we left with never, c'mon

[Chorus: Eve & Pharrell Williams]
It's okay, it's alright
I'll live with it, but you decided
I knew you're gone, left me no go
But I'm okay, I'll go solo
Hey, now, hey, now, hey, hey, hey, now
Hey, now, hey, now
Guess who's single? Yup
Hey, now, hey, now, hey, hey, hey, now
Hey, now, hey, now

Oh yeah, it started off good, how it always do
You know, that good lovin' feelin' when the shit be new?
The stupid gigglin' n' touchin', non-stop fun
Anything he do, he got my whole body blushin'
Shit, well, I'm over that now
Pick up, it's his voice, I'm over that sound
Huh, I must admit it takes some time, though
Call up all your girls, go to the club and pop some bottles
No, don't ever sit around sad
It is what it is, put the past in the past
Huh, no matter what it used to be like
It's over now, you movin' on, I wanna hear you be like...

[Chorus: Eve & Pharrell Williams]
It's okay, it's alright
I'll live with it, but you decided

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Check us out, we're ridin' this solo, honey
Ain't no room in this Mercedes for funny business
Funny, funny, funny business
You look good in them jeans, but you can kiss this
This ain't no real reflection of my affection for you
So, please, sir roll up them sleeves just a little
I want them diamond cufflinks, but guess who's single?

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
My girls to the left
My girls to the right
My girls, sing it loud if you're single
My boys said your head went jingle
It's time to wake up from that dream
The voices in your head, the voices at night
Screamin' that you wanna be single
My voice could be your therapy
Walk away smilin' like me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So, I said...

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

[Bridge]
And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (If you go with me)
For life (See the world with me)

[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

I'm American, I'm gypsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
Hey...




[Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think I should settle down or that we could just be friends
"Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
But then we, we kissed all night as his mission beach party
And I said

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
I'm packing bags and making stacks
Like a good old time American
And I'm just tryna show my mom and dad
There's such thing as a real good man
Cause when he talks to me, you see the man that you're talking about as I see
When he puts my hand over his bathing suit
Says to me...

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Doesn't matter if your daddy gets pissed
It's you and me

[Refrain]
Baby, for life (if you go with me)
For life (see the world with me)
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

Whenever I'm dressed cool, my parents put up a fight
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And if I'm a hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And in the morning, I'm short of my identity
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I scream, "Mom and Dad, why can't I be who I wanna be?"
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
To be

I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am

That I'll die living just as free as my hair

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I've got my bangs to hide that I don't stand a chance
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
A chance (No)

And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed

Damn, It's good to be rich and famous...
It's like a heiress.....

Feet are feeling light
Head on out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?

Ducking up and down
All these crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool

Just when you think
You're a chain with just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool

Hello hello
Hello hello

What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out threr dropped say hello
Hello!


Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free

Sniffing on a flower
Run through an autumn shower
Bumping into someone else like me

Hello hello

Hello hello
My my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!

Hello, Hello
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello

And I could fly on the back of a bird
I could shake all the leaves from a tree
If there's a quest I'm a Knight
Where's there's wrong I'll do right
Two is better than the one I used to be


Hello hello

Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free
Sniffing on a flower
Run through an autumn shower
I'm better off with someone else like me
Me

[Chorus: Elton John, Lady Gaga, Both]
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise, What a surprise!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

[Bridge: Both]
And I could fly on the back of a bird
And I can shake all the leaves from a tree
If there's a quest I'm a knight
Where's there's wrong I'll do right
Two is better than the one I used to be


[Chorus: Elton John, Lady Gaga, Both]
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise, What a surprise!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise, What a surprise!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

[Outro: Elton John & Lady Gaga]
Heeello!
Hellooooo!
Heeello!
Heeello!
Hello, hello!
Hello, hello, hello, hello!



[Verse 1: Lady Gaga & Florence Welch]
Hey girl, can you hear me?
Are you holding out your heart?
Hey girl, do you feel me?
Sometimes I go too far
Hey girl, it ain't easy
I know it's pulling me apart
But darlin', don't you leave me
Baby, don't you leave me

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Florence Welch]
Hey girl, hey girl
We can make it easy if we lift each other
Hey girl, hey girl
We don't need to keep on one-in' up another
Hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl
If you lose your way
Just know that I got you
Just know that I got you

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga & Florence Welch]
Lady is it lonely?
I been callin' out your name
Tell me that you need me
'Cause I need you just the same
Everyday a heartache
I'm just tryin' to keep it sane
But I know you believe me
Baby don't you leave me

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Florence Welch]
Hey girl, hey girl
We can make it easy if we lift each other
Hey girl, hey girl
We don't need to keep on one-in' up another
Hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl
If you lose your way
Just know that I got you

[Bridge: Lady Gaga, Florence Welch & Both]
Help me hold my hair back
Walk me home 'cause I can't find a cab
And we dance down The Bowery
Held hands like we were 17 again
And then it's 4am
The sun is creepin' up again
Don't you leave me
Oh, darling don't you leave me

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Florence Welch]
Hey girl, hey girl
We can make it easy if we lift each other
Hey girl, hey girl
We don't need to keep on one-in' up another
Hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl
If you lose your way
Just know that I got you

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Just know that
Just know that I got you
Just know that
Just know that
Just know that
Help me hold my hair back
Walk me home 'cause I can't find a cab
And we dance down The Bowery
Held hands like we were 17 again

[Chorus]
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

[Interlude]
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-

[Verse 1]
Run run, with her top down, baby, she flies
Run run, with the fury of a saint in her eyes
Run run, ha-cha cha cha, baby, she goes
With blonde hair and a gun smoking under her toes

[Pre-Chorus]
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, ride ride
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, tonight


[Chorus]
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love

[Verse 2]
She's just an American, riding a dream
When she's got a rainbow syrup in her heart that she bleeds
She don't care if your papers or your love is the law
She's a free soul burning roads, with a flag in her bra

[Pre-Chorus]
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, ride ride
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, tonight

[Chorus]
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love


[Bridge]
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause' we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause' we're gonna drink until we die
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause' we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause' we're gonna drink until we die



Listen
I've got the sickest ambition
Deep in the mirror I am scared
Don't know who the hell is there
Yeah, I'm losing my reflection

Obsession
It's the thing, it's our new religion
Each model and celebrity
Changes how I look at me
Oh, don't tell me, don't tell me
I'll never be

A superstar 'cause I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood
In Hollywood, In Hollywood

Women
Let's talk about our condition
Now beauty's a commodity
Nip and tuck your fantasy
But your better live with your revisions

I have a vision
It's a world without these decisions
Sure Hollywood's commercially
Glamorous but naturally's the way to be
And you can't tell me I'm not sexy

I'm a superstar, And I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood

You know I could
Hollywood, Hollywood

Oh within a year I know I could
Oh look like a girl in Hollywood
Oh a superstar, yeah I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood

I could
Hollywood

Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood yeah
Hollywood, Hollywood

Within the year I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood
Like superstars, yeah I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywood
In Hollywood, Hollywood

Lady Gaga:
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream awhile, scheme awhile, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess, all those things you've always pined for

Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, Tony
With Diamond bracelets Tiffany's doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day you know darn well
Oh I can't give you anything but love

Tony Bennett:
I can't give you anything but love, Lady
That's the only thing I've plenty of, Lady

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I don't know what love is
If I can't have you here
I don't know what love is
I think that it's just fear

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
I don't know the tempo
Of my heart's concerto
It all seems like a dream
It's not
I know there's something real out there for me

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue, every color I choose
But I don't know what love is
But I think it might be you

[Verse 3: Bradley Cooper]
If I had the courage
I'd know just what to do
Sometimes I have to crawl
And everyday I fall
Tryin' just to stand by you


[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue, every color I choose
But I don't know what love is
But I think it might be you

But Now I know I'm wrong
Oh

[Intro]
Initiating Cherry Cherry Boom Boom, Lady Gaga
I like it rough

[Verse 1]
Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside bangin', then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl
Loving me's like chewing on pearls

[Chorus]
You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough

[Verse 2]
Won't go without my fix tonight
It's a little too rough
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines
And she can't get enough


[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm in the bedroom with tissues
And when I know you're outside banging, then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl
Loving me's like straightening curls

[Chorus]
You've got me wondering why I (you got me), I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
You've got me wondering why I (oh, yeah), I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough

[Bridge]
I'm shiny, and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough (baby, likes it rough)
I'm shiny, and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough (baby, likes it rough)

[Breakdown]
(I'm shiny, and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough; baby, likes it rough)
Is it cause you don't mean it, or because I don't feel it unless it's rough?
(I'm shiny, and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough; Lady Gaga)
Is it cause you don't mean it, or because I don't feel it unless it's rough?


[Chorus]
(You got, yeah, yeah, you have got me, oh, wondering why)
You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
You got me wondering why I (oh-oh, yeah), I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I (oh wondering why), I like it rough
You got me wondering why I (yeah, yeah you have got me), I like it rough

You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough

[Verse 1]
Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou

Oh

[Verse 2]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss

Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love

[Bridge]
I don't wanna know this feeling
Unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment, ooh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Oooo I'll never love again
Love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again

[Outro]
I won't I won't I swear I can't
I wish I could but I just won't
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again
Who oo oo oo oo
Hmmm




[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Wish I could
I could have said goodbye

Tryin' to save a part of you

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself lyin' in your arms

And I wanna pretend that it's not true oh baby that you're gone
Cause my world keeps turnin' and turnin' and turnin' and I'm not movin' on

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire

Baby unless they are your lips

[Outro: Bradley Cooper]
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Don't let another day begin
Won't let the sunlight in
Oh I'll never love again
Never love again
Never love again
Oh I'll never love again




[Verse 1]
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy, if you try
No hell below us
And only Matthew in the sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Ah-ah-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace
Ah-ah-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday that you'll join us
And the world will live as one

[Verse 3]
People of the nation
Are you listening?
It isn't equal if it's sometimes
I want a real democracy
Imagine all the people
Could love equally

[Verse 4]
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger, oh yeah
Just the brotherhood of man

[Verse 5]
Imagine all the people sharing in the world
With nothing to hate, and nothing to think
Just people to love, and friends to have drinks

[Chorus]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday that you'll join us
Oh-oh, yeah
And the world will live as one




If I handed you the world
Why'd you break mine?
If I gave you the world
Why'd you shake mine?
Cause the truth is, I love you
But the truth is, I can't be with you
I guess, I'm In Like With You

I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick
You can build a house or sink a dead body

I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown
King with no crown

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

[Breakdown]
Ew...
In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue and
Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah woah woah woah woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

[Outro]
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga




[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Verse 1]
Can't decide, can't define what I feel inside
It's still bad, it's still good, prefer and love
It's a rush, it's so rough, this is out of line
It's a storm and it rock, rock, rocks my boat

[Pre-Chorus]
My destiny, misery, your energy

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Verse 2]
Like a wild wrecking ball, crashing block-by-block
I'm defenseless, it penetrates my walls
Freezing cold, steaming hot, sweaty drip-drip-drop
It's unstoppable, I can't shake it off

[Pre-Chorus]
My destiny, misery, your energy

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Bridge]
It's taking me down and getting me high
It brings every fantasy to life
It's getting so loud, I hear it all around
And I just can't fight

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind


[Verse 1]
Life is so simple
A little boy, a little girl
Laughing and loving
Tryin' to figure out the world
It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story but tell me again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am

[Chorus]
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?


[Verse 2]
I hope you're still with me
When I'm not quite myself
And I pray that you'll lift me
When you know I need help
It's a warm celebration of all of our years
I dream of our story of our fairytale

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Family dinners and family trees
Teachin' the kids to say thank you and please
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right

[Chorus]
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?


[Outro]
Is that alright?

[Verse 1]
It's off, it's on
The party's just begun
Take off, and run
Let's celebrate the fun of being young
I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna grow up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the lights come on
You lift me up, and I feel strong

[Chorus]
I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you

[Verse 2]
Lights off, lights on
The music has begun
Rely, or run
Get the bad guy's gun
I love the songs that you play
And I don't care what they say
'Cause I was born this way

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hear you scream, I hit the top of the stage
And close my eyes, and know exactly who I am
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
And I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing for a living, but I wanna be in love
And I, I wanna be with you
This one's for you




[Intro]
Nile, Chic, Gaga
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

[Verse 1]
Do you feel, like you ever want to try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see when you look at me?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
Oh, all alone, in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you
And I dream of you, all of the time
What am I gonna do?

[Chorus]
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love

You know I need your love, you know I need your love

I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds needs sky above
I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need
I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need

[Chorus]
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)

[Outro]
I want your love, I want your love
(Have you ever been in love?)
You know I need your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
I want your love, need your love
You know I need your love
I want your love, I want your love

I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

[Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga]:
When you dance
You're charming and you're gentle
Especially when we do the continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental

Why should I?

How could I?
I won't dance
Merci Beaucoup

You know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms
I won't dance

But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

Do you wanna see me naked, lcver?

Last night
Damn, you were in my s* dreams
Doing really nasty things

Making love in my s* dreams

You could turn to stone
Or the color of men pctrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

Lady of the 'Dam
Won't be a slave to the blonde, or the culture of the popular
She won't, she won't
Sing at you, I'll fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than

[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, it's about that time, yeah
Time ta take off partna, alright?
Hustle Gang, uh huh, G-D-O-D
Get your doe or die, partna
Yup, leggo

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Still Bankhead, shawty, yeah, you know what it is
Pockets full of numbers, rubber bands and bills
Came up from 'round, that standard wheel
Was finna do a deal, 'bout 60 mill
You ain't lived that life, you perpetrating
You wasn't really trapping circling birds of prey
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a ho any day
'Round my way can't get murder planned
Ain't no hoop, play dirty, man
Put some through your jersey, man
If your partner want some, we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E G-A-N-G, yeah, wait
Yeah, pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go ahead, Gaga

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love


[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
And you've surveyed the way we've acted
Keep it coming, I'm coming around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 3: Too Short]
Everybody want that money, what you want
High as hell, trying to have some fucking fun
You don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine
Tried to kick it just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet event, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passing 'em freaks
Bitch!


[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs,  play that hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Ain't nothing if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

[iTunes Festival: Beat Break]
DJ White Shadow!

[Verse 4: Twista]
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I am influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving her money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'mma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business, but I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels and drugs


[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Ain't nothing if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

If you could, I know that you'd stay
We both know things don't work that way
I promised I wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin and my voice  gets thin

[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't see you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar


[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

It's like, I just love a cowboy
You know

But I'm just like
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse
And can you go a little faster?!

3 am, mustang speedin'
Two lovers, headed for a dead end

Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
1-2 ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight

Knock me over
Here I go
Into our love storm

Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare *get off hat*
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
1-2 ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke !
Racin' through the moonlight

Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

Even darkness forgave her crooked way
I've learned love is like a brick you can
Build a house or sink a dead body

But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet

And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways

When I come through on the dance floor, checking out that catalogue
Can't believe my eyes
So many women without a flaw
And I ain't gonna give it up
Steady, tryna pick it up, like a call
I'mma hit it, I'mma beat it and latch onto it until tomorrow, yeah
Shorty, I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirling up them hips 'round and 'round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime, stay and let me watch you break it down

When I asked you earlier if you were on your feet, how are we doing on that?

Okay good
Well, if anybody's still sitting down, now really I'm gonna need you to get on your feet for real now
And I got one thing to say to you

[Intro]
*Stand alone on disco-stick* Let's have some fun this beat is sick, I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

HANDS UP JUMP!
LET'S PARTY ROBLOX. HA!

*takes disco stick*

[Verse 1]
I wanna k. you
But if I do, then I might miss you, bcbe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by scxy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lcvegame, a lcvegame

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me and lcve me
Just wanna t. you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Put your hands up Roblox !

[Chorus]
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame, do you want l*ve or you want fame, are you in the game?

*gives disco stick*

[Bridge]
I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a, and a game
And a game!
And a game!
And a game!
A LOVE GAME !

*does break-dance*

-Telephone-

I lxve you all so much. Yeah I do

I lxve you so much that every time I get on stage I get this whole warm-up, I get my body moving, and I do my vocal warm-ups
And I can see you all out there and I'm thinking about the stage, and the lights and how I'm gonna do the thing

And then sometimes I get a phone call right before and I'm like who is calling me?
I got a sold out arena waiting and I'm kinda busy right now!

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, babx, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you see, see
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh?
You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

*does chorexo*

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
MY TELEPHONE ! MY TELEPHONE ! AND YOURE NOT GONNA REACH MY TELEPHONE !

We've got nothing left to lose but limousines and attitudes
Yeah, we're banking on us
Oh, baby, it's crazy
We've got nothing left to make but icing on this little cake
Fashion sense and vanity consume us, 'cause we...

We want that Kandy Life
For me, I'd like that Kandy Life
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life?
I know our style might be abridged
But we are the ones, bitch

[Verse 2]
We got sour grapes to fry to limit this credit card life
We're banking on hits

You can tell by the look in my eyes

One-one, this a killa love song
We can make it right
If we stick together long, long

[Verse 1]
I can't remember when you looked at me and cried
Said something broke inside of you
Were my best friend
Whatever come our way, you know I'm your girl 'til the end

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I'll finally go away
I know you'll look for me one day

[Chorus]
When you let love down
Oh, you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down
Oh, you let me down
Get a little let down
Let it down

[Verse 2]
I can't remember when you put your hand on mine
But couldn't play in time
When we, yeah, when we're not together
Just sing a little song
Blueberry kisses forever


[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, when I'll finally go away (when I'll finally go away)
I know you'll look for me one day
Oh, yeah
It's so sad

[Chorus]
When you let love down
Oh, you let love down
I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
When you let love down

Don't let me down
Let it down
Can't let love down
Let it down
Can't let love down
Let it down

There may be trouble ahead,
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled,
Before they ask us to pay the bill,
And while we still have the chance,
Let's face the music and dance

Soon,
We'll be without the moon,
Humming a different tune,
And then

There may be teardrops to shed,
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance

(Take it! Come on!)

[Instrumental]

Soon,
We'll be without the moon,
Humming a different tune,
And then, and then,


There maybe teardrops to shed,
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance, dance
Let's face the music and dance

-

Every single day yeah I dig a grave, then I sit inside it wondering if I'll behave. It's a game I play, and I hate to say you're the worst thing and best thing that's happened to me




[Verse 1]
When they're young
All Little Monsters
Learn that they're scary
Ugly, stupid, shunned by Cupid
Overweight & hairy

[Verse 2]
But every Monster needs to find
That secret deep inside
That transforms Dr. Jekyll into
Sexy, Mr. Hyde

[Chorus]
All my Monsters are beautiful
Disco Stutiful
Square rootiful
Old cutiful

[Post-Chorus]
Monsters don't need implants
Or a bitching Monster car
Monsters only need to love
The Monsters, that they are

[Hook]
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Gaga, dada, jawa
Peace!

[Verse 1]
When they're young
All Little Monsters
Learn that they're scary
Ugly, stupid, shunned by Cupid
Overweight & hairy

[Verse 2]
But every Monster needs to find
That secret deep inside
That transforms Dr. Jekyll into
Sexy, Mr. Hyde

[Chorus]
All my Monsters are beautiful
Disco Stutiful
Square rootiful
Old cutiful

[Post-Chorus]
Monsters don't need implants
Or a bitching Monster car
Monsters only need to love
The Monsters, that they are

[Verse 1]
I've got no friends
I'm my own queen
But I'm living on, living on the radio, that's my dream
Stone river eyes, and a lonely heart
If I'm living on the radio, they won't tear me apart

[Verse 2]
10 stems and roses on a tree
10 steps, and lonely nights, but you still got me
On the road, road paved in gold

[Chorus]
Baby you must believe
Baby you must be free
Keep living on, living on the radio, that's your dream
Baby you've got a friend
And so many little monsters, yeah
Keep living on, living on the radio

[Verse 3]
And when there's nowhere to go
And all your friends are gone
And you've only got your daddy to call
You can be all right honey
'Cause your songs are on the radio

[Verse 4]
'Cause you're sure to miss all the caviar
The champagne, and the sold-out shows
But we'll be all right honey
'Cause your songs are on the radio




[Verse 1]
Hurry it up
We're gonna party hard tonight (Night Night)
Hair curled up
And my skirt is pretty tight (Tight Tight)
Hold me, rub me, dance up on me
Promise I won't bite (Bite Bite)
Squeeze me like a lemon
Honey Drop it hot tonight (Night Night)

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancin'
It's a California weekend
Can't stop the beat that I'm feelin'
Dancin'

Never been the kind to wait around for the girls
You know I'm comin' out a Lola tonight
Never been the kind to wait around for the boys
You know I'm comin' out a Lola tonight
Lola la la la la la la
Lola la la la la la la la

[Verse 2]
Enough is enough
I'm not sittin' home tonight
Put on your glasses
'Cause this chick is outta sight
Hold me, rub me, dance up on me
Promise I won't bite
I'm a cupcake baby
It's your birthday all night
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm alone in my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I've been knockin' 'em down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights on the street like stars

[Chorus 1]
But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

[Verse 2]
Under the foggy day
I'm lookin' for a light
And my only friend
Is workin' tonight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song

[Chorus 2]
But look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what I found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

[Bridge]
When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I can't believe it won't believe it
Uh

[Chorus 3]
Look what you found!
Yeah baby
Look what I found
Someone who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Look what I found
Whoo!
C'mon!
Look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what we found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Heart just layin' on the ground

[Intro]
Would you love me right?

[Verse 1]
My life is a story
Do you wanna know the truth?
I'm tall in high heels
But I am only five foot two
What you see ain't always
What you gonna get, it's true
You see the best in me
Even when I have no clue

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel this way no more
I don't wanna feel this weight
I'm sick of hiding from myself
I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna run far from my home
I don't wanna lose my way
I don't wanna be my friend no more
I don't wanna play this game

[Chorus]
Would you still love me if I gave it all up just to cry?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?
Would you still need me if I didn't t-tell you goodbye?
Would you still love me?
Would, would you still love me right?

[Verse 2]
Take my picture from me
And imagine what I'd do
I know what's best for me
Tryna do what's best for you
This could all be fiction
I know that it sounds taboo
I wear my heart on my sleeve
It's making its debut

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel this way no more
I don't wanna feel this weight
I'm sick of hiding from myself
I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna run far from my home
I don't wanna lose my way
I don't wanna be my friend no more
I don't wanna play this game

Face down in a pillow, she cries
Her black mascara runs in circles from her-er-er eyes
Pink feather regrets she washes away
She said she wants him
But it's hurtin' and it's burnin' him the worst
The worst way

Listen to the girl
She's love sick oh, oh
She's got a new man
But he doesn't know-ow
'Bout the love sick girl
Where does it hurt
Where does it hurt
Love sick girl
Where does it hurt
Where does it hurt
Where does it hurt

She says she wants him
But it's hurtin' and it's burnin', oh
Love sick girl

Luck down in a bathroom, she cries
Her white skin looks better in this kind of light
Pink feather regrets she washes away
Looks in her mirror
And it's hurtin' and it's burnin' in the worst
The worst way


Listen to the girl
She's love sick oh, oh
She's got a new man
But he doesn't know-ow
'Bout the love sick girl
Where does it hurt

[Hook]
I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingue traces
That used to be there you could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clocktails

Then you came along with your siren's song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your pointed smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong
Again I was wrong

[Bridge]
Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so assured
Now life is awful again
And the thoughtful of heart
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush
Life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too




[Intro: Lady Gaga]
It's nothin' you can't handle babe
Domino, not Splenda made
So lick your lips and brace your tongue
Get over here, you love me some

[Verse 1: CJ Holland]
I see you baby, and I got it bad
I said it lady, I won't take it back
I just don't know what's come over me
But if you taste like you look
Then you taste sugar sweet
Girl
So hot, make me lose my cool. (cool)

And fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for her bitches (Ayy)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for the sticking (Ayy)
And fuck them other niggas, hope she down for some licking (Ayy)
And fuck them other bitches 'cause she down for the tricking, ugh

When it's said and done, do she spit it up or swallow now?
I ain't gotta trip about them niggas who like her

How old is that? (Man!) Old enough
I got seniority with the sororities
So, that explain why I love college
Getting brain in the library 'cause I love knowledge
When you use your medulla oblongata
And give me scoliosis until I'm comatos-es
And do while I'm sleep, yeah a little osmosis
And that's my commandment you ain't gotta ask Moses
More champagne, more toasts-es
More damn planes, more coasts-es
And fuck a bus, the Benz is parked like Rosa, -oza

[Verse 3: Common]
She blamed it on the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-alcohol (Woo!)
She had her hair did; it was bound to fall (Woo!)
Down, down for a-damn, Cudi already said it
Her poker Facebook, I already reddit
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body, known to blow fuses
A stripper from the South, looking for a payday
Said, "Bitch, you should do it for the love like Ray J"
But they say, you be on that conscious tip
Get your head right, and get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the godly to the party
It's the way I was raised on the Southside safari, so

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Lady Gaga {with A-Trak}]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face

Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH
When I
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face

She's got me like nobody

Kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser

Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
Cause that's where we make love
Come on run

I'm gonna marry the...
I'm gonna marry the...

Ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-night

[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love
In my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar
But I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
The night, the night, the night (night...)

[Verse 1]
Lady of the Dam
Won't be a slave to the blonde, or the culture of the popular
(She won't, she won't)
Sing at you, I'll fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight
(I will, I will)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

[Chorus]
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Woo-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Oh-hoo!)


[Verse 2]
I don't like to boast
But our truffles are the most
Mad-magical in Amsterdam
(She won't, she won't)
So if you have fear, Apollo
Sit on my lyre, and play him like a piano, man
(I will, I will)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

[Chorus]
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Woo-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Oh-hoo!)


[Bridge]
I know that Mom and Dad think I'm a mess
But it's alright, because I am rich as piss
When I ignite the flame and put you in my mouth
The grass eats up my insides, and my brunette starts to sprout
Introducing, ladies and gentleman, Mary Jane Holland!

[Chorus]
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Woo-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Oh-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Woo-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Oh-hoo!)

Girl's muscles in my bones
But I'm too poor to pay the penance
You know the cadilac's her man
But I don't have a licence

I drive, I'm mean
Boys that I choose
Never come out clean

I doubt you are sleeping
And dreaming of me on your own
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, don't

Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's not nice

Yeah, my little rapture
Open up and maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your match, sir
You know you've met the master heartbreaker

Oh this devil in my mouth
And when we kiss I'll pull him out
I think my love is sworn
Up with my rose with stinging thorns


I kiss, I'm mean
Boys like you
They never come out clean

And while you are cursing
And crying 'cause I sent you home
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, don't

Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's not nice

Yeah, my little rapture
Open up and maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your match, sir
You know you've met the master heartbreaker

Huh, huh huh, huh
I'm thinking about the ways
I can hurt you so don't
Don't, don't, huh, huh, huh

Don't open my eyes
Don't let her out
She's, no, she's not nice


Yeah, my little rapture
Open up and maybe I'll capture it
Yeah, you met your match, sir
You know you've met the master heartbreaker
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heartbreaker



[Chorus 1]
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change a man
Hell, it takes a lot to try
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die

[Verse 1]
Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Some folks just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read
Nobody knows what awaits for the dead

[Verse 2]
I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from
I'm glad those days are gone, gone for good
But if I could take spirits from my past and bring 'em here
You know I would
Know I would

[Verse 3]
Nobody speaks to God these days
Nobody speaks to God these days
I'd like to think he's lookin' down and laughin' at our ways
Nobody speaks to God these days

[Verse 4]
When I was a child, they tried to fool me
Said the worldly man was lost and that a Hell was real
Well I've seen Hell in Reno
And this world's one big old Catherine wheel
Spinnin' steel

[Chorus 2]
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change your plans
And a train to change your mind
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Oh, maybe it's time to let the old ways die

You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons

But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons


[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons

Don't call me Gaga
I've never seen one like that before
Don't look at me like that
You amaze me, big boy
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart (You little monster)
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart out (You amaze me)
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart out

[Verse 1]
Look at him, look at me
That boy is bad and honestly
He's a wolf in disguise
But I can't stop staring in those evil eyes (Evil eyes, evil eyes)

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked my girlfriend if she'd seen you 'round before (Oh yeah)
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor, baby
"We might've fucked, not really sure, don't quite recall
But something tells me that I've seen him, yeah"

[Chorus]
That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)

He ate my heart (I love that girl)
He ate my heart (wanna to talk to her, she's hot as hell)

He licked his lips
Said to me, "Girl, you look good enough to eat."
Put his arms around me
Said, "Boy, no, get your paws right off me."

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked my girlfriend if she'd seen you 'round before (Oh yeah)

He ate my heart (Wanna to talk to her, she's hot as hell)
He ate my heart (I love that girl)
He ate my heart (Wanna to talk to her, she's hot as hell)

[Breakdown]
He ate my heart, he ate my heart
Instead, he's a monster in my bed
He ate my heart, he ate my heart
Instead, he's a monster in my bed

[Bridge]
I wanna just dance, but he took me home instead
Uh-oh, there was a monster in my bed
We french kissed on a subway train
He tore my clothes right off
He ate my heart and then he ate my brain
Uh-oh, uh-oh (I love that girl)
Uh oh-oh, oh (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)
(He ate my heart) Uh oh-oh, oh

And it's killing me inside
I think that you don't understand
How I... would give you all I have and all I am

And the way you've been slaying my heart

Baby it kills me cause now that I found you

And I'm losin' control!
Someone turned out
The lights in musicland
But the record starts to spin
I feel the music and
We start to dance, yeah!



[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
You're music to my eyes
I had to listen just to find you
I like for you to let me sing along
Give you a rhythm you feel

[Pre-Chorus: Bradley Cooper]
I wanna learn your every line
I wanna fill your empty spaces
I want to play the part to reach your heart
Sing you a song that you feel

[Chorus: Bradley Cooper]
Love let your music be mine
Sing while I harmonize
Let your melodies fly in my direction
Take me to your paradise
On a musical ride
I'm in love with your music baby
You're music to my eyes

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Your voice is quite a view
I heard a song and then I saw you
I learned the lyrics and knew you were mine
Dance the horizon with you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I wanna sing you a sunrise
And be the dawn I know will move you
I'd like to be the strings on your guitar
Touch me and play what you feel

Love let your music be mine
Sing while I harmonize

Take me to your paradise

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

[Chorus: Tony Bennett]
And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me

[Hook: Both]
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"

[Chorus: Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett]
And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me

"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"

Smoke smoke baby like a motorbike
Take your trash to my junkyard site
In your skies I will fly my kite

I'm just an ordinary superstar
So far but always hanging where you are
I'm just an ordinary superstar
We're just New York Girls!

(Verse 1 Madonna)
Girl on the screen, look at me
I never would have guessed that we'd be friends
Oh, but you don't want to be seen with me
I wanna see what you see
We're living in a world that's full of hate
Oh, but you don't care what they say
Do you?

(Chorus)
Down the subway, you looked my way
With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Couldn't stay the same
Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking
'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in
Telling myself that it's cheating
But it's New York Girls

(Verse 2 Gaga)

New York Girls little let down, but I'm not dead
There's a little bit more that has to be said (oh, oh)
You play me, now I play you too
Let's just call it over

(Chorus 2)

Down the subway, you looked my way
With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Couldn't stay the same
Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking
'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in
Telling myself that it's cheating
But it's New York Girls

(Bridge Gaga, Madonna)

Scared to keep the lights on when I kiss you Slowly
Kissing you slowly
Does that mean that you're afraid to look at Real eyes baby

(Chorus 3, Ending)

Down the subway, you looked my way
With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Couldn't stay the same
Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking
'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in
Telling myself that it's cheating
But it's New York Girls
NEW. YORK. GIRLS!

[Verse 1]
I never ever thought I'd live away
From everybody that I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
"There she goes, that crazy girl...
She thinks she's something in this world."
So I'mma close my ears and dream 'cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
Yeah, you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Verse 2]
On every street there is a memory
A time and place where we can never be again, uh-uh-uh-oh
Street lights glow red, green and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do?
Yeah, when you say stop, be sure that I'll say "go"
To the stars and land
Fire can't burn these hands
But I just close my eyes and dream
You can't deny me, my strong mean
Hey
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Bridge]
Go ahead and don't believe
Cause everyone needs a way to breathe, and love, and dream
And you can't stop me
You can't stop me

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Outro]
I never ever thought I'd live away from everybody that I love and say goodbye

You know I need you so desperately
You know how bad I can get

[Verse 1]
Don't belong to any city
Don't belong to any man
Keeping it to myself but
You're on my mind again

I'm not the kind to admit
Babe when you're under my skin
One night with you in my head
Kind we could not forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you've been haunting me
But this ain't really me
Baby can't you see
What you give you get?

I know you got regrets
And every year
In mid-November
I'm the one you'll remember

[Chorus/Drop (8 bars)]

[Verse 2]
Before I let you go
Something that you should know
Can't say that I was wrong but
Babe it has been so long


I'm not the kind to admit
Babe when you're under my skin
One night with you in my head
Kind we could not forget



[Verse 1]
Don't belong to any city
Don't belong to any man
Keeping it to myself but
You're on my mind again

[Pre Chorus]
I'm not the kind to admit
Babe when you're under my skin
One night with you in my head
Kind we cannot forget

[Chorus]
Yeah you've been haunting me
But this ain't really me
Baby can't you see
What you give you get?

I know you got regrets
And every year in
Mid November
I'm the one you'll remember

[Verse 2]
Before I let you go
Something that you should know
Can't say that I was wrong but
Babe it has been so long

[Pre Chorus]
I'm not the kind to admit
Babe when you're under my skin
One night with you in my head
Kind we cannot forget

[Chorus]
Yeah you've been haunting me
But this ain't really me
Baby can't you see
What you give you get?

I know you got regrets
And every year in
Mid November
I'm the one you'll remember

[Outro/Chorus]
Yeah you've been haunting me
But this ain't really me
Baby can't you see
What you give you get?

I know you got regrets
And every year in
Mid November
I'm the one you'll remember


[Intro]
(Happy Ending...)

[Verse 1]
I saw a shadow, and I knew that it wasn't mine
You and her, I know that you were intertwined
Even though her clothes were on and everything
Your eyes were somewhere else, and you were both to blame

[Verse 2]
Don't say a word
I'm sure that it won't be enough to erase what I know
Just happens now, what dreams are made of
This is my house, and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way

[Chorus]
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay

[Verse 3]
Thought that I saw something I know did not belong to me
But then I thought that there's no way you would do that to me
And then last week, when you went aside to use your phone
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold


[Verse 4]
And I just woke up, but I wish that it was a nightmare
'Cause when I have those, it isn't real like this one is
This is my heart, and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby, don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, no way

[Chorus]
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay

[Bridge]
Get your things and go
You can take the dinner left over from last night
I made you your favorite goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying, answer is no way
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it)
No way-ay-ay-ay (I can't believe it, babe)
No way-ay-ay-ay

[Verse 1]
Tall buddy told me your name
And that you had no woman
High heel shoes and tight jeans
I could be your girlfriend
Can't you see us, superstar love
In between the sheets we go

[Chorus]
Oh baby
Oh baby
We've got music tonight
We're gonna make it happen this time, this time
Lets get physical
Ride her like a bicycle, baby
Oh baby

[verse 2]
Never met a man like you
Sugar pie gone real bad
Look for a whole lot of love
Song comes on, we sing "hell yeah!"
Can't you see us, superstar love
In between the sheets we go

[Chorus]
Oh baby
Oh baby
We've got music tonight
We're gonna make it happen this time, this time
Lets get physical
Ride her like a bicycle, baby
Oh baby


[Verse 1]
Where did they go?
Where did everybody go?
I wanna know

[Verse 2]
We could've tried
Why did everybody cry if you weren't mine?

[Chorus]
And now everything is gonna change
You made your mind up
Well, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love?
I'm at a loss, so well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well

[Verse 3]
Can't find the words
But hey, man, everybody hurts
When it doesn't work

[Chorus]
And now everything is gonna change
You made your mind up
Well, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love?
I'm at a loss, so well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well


[Bridge]
Your love drowned us in a hole
You never ever wanted her to grow
To grow
Oh, oh
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

[Chorus]
If everything is gonna change, was it worth it?
Oh, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love?
You weren't strong enough, oh well, for me...
Oh well
Oh well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well

I use my heart to make my art
I'm just an Onion Girl at heart
You can't pull a tear or peel me apart

The more you peel away, babe, the more I'll start to cry
Let my tears unfurl, yeah, I
I'm your Onion Girl

Baby, I'm gonna make you cry, burn your lovely eyes. He said "She's an Onion Girl" (Gonna make you cry)

You think you peeled her off?
You don't know a fuck about this family
Leave them alone
An onion like you could make them cry
Onion girl
Onion fraeulein
You are simply an onion filles
Try to move like a german vieh


You're like the definition of negative
Always complainin', you're such a pessimist
(Your) Cup is always half empty
I'm just so sick of it
I got a different perspective

(My) Cup is half full
(My) Sky is never gray
(You...) You can't bring be down anymore baby
(My) Future is bright
(Can't) Wait to face the day
There's one thing you should know about me. (Mee...)

Im an optimist. (Stop!)
So positive. (Bitch!)
You'll never get another chance with me baby
Im an optimist. (Out!)
So positive. (Bitch!)
Your chances blown, boy you're gone, spread your negativity

(I'm an optimist, toppop-timist-toppop-timist)

You're such a downer, You're never satisfied
Lucky for me, there's always a silver line
On the horizon, so boy dont even try
Injectin' me with your negative vibes



[Intro]
So...let's do Orange Colored Sky
Yeah?
I used to sing this at the Oak Room with my buddies
Woo! It's getting windy

[Verse 1]
I was walking along, minding my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, bam, alakazam
Wonderful you came by
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
Wham, bam, alakazam
I got a look at you

[Chorus]
Oh, one look and I yelled, "Timber!"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
This is it, this is it

[Verse 2]
I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored sky


[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, one look and I yelled, "Timber!"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
This is it, this is it

[Verse 3]
I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored, purple striped, pretty green polkadot sky
Wham, bam, alakazam
And gone, bye
Goodbye


I know that you all have been feeling a tremendous range of emotions. Since we've all have heard about this horrible, hateful attack on Orlando and on your and our community. As we have now witnessed the largest mass shooting in American history. I can't help but feel that this level of hatred, like all predigital crimes, this is an attack on humanity itself. This is an attack on everyone. Tonight I gather humbly with you. As a human being: in peace, in sincerity, in commitment, in solidarity. To take a real moment and mourn the tragic loss of these innocent, beautiful people. And let's all today pledge an allegiance of love to them, and to their families, who are suffering so deeply. They are sons and daughters, they're fathers and mothers, they are all our brothers and our sisters. But tonight I will not allow my anger and outrage over this attack to overshadow our need to honour those who are grieving truly for their lost ones. Lost members of the LGBT community. I hope you know that myself and so many are your allies. Not only me but everyone here, we represent the compassion and the loyalty of millions of people around the world that believe in you, you are not alone. You are not alone. Tomorrow I hope that we all raise thoughtfully and loudly towards solutions. But tonight and right now, Orlando, we are united with you and we are here to remember.

[Pre-Chorus]

I need a love that's crazy, don't you see
I'm looking for someone who can handle me
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so
I'm sorry when I met'cha that I did not know

Need someone who's the same, in love with me

Not enough, not enough
Not enough, I mean it

Don't pull me down
I love you more in my wavelength, in the night
(Cuz you want me

Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control

Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control
Give it up, just let your body, out of control

Running round with no clothes on
Heels in the ground
Almost famous on the scene
She looks like a celebrity
Who's that girl?
She's so shiny
Ain't no way her waist that tiny
Sequins in her hair
Homegirl doesn't care

Baby shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties

Bubble wraper, furious

Sequins in her hair
Homegirl doesn't care

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby shake your fanny, fanny

Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand
Inkin' Lincoln, sanskrit with a fan
Rememberin' me, before we began
Sometimes I felt so Def in the Jam
But the ones who loved me, told me to stop
Like, "Homegirl can't catch shit if it drop"
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man

'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

Not interested in fakers

'Til your diamond words melted into some ice

Mr. Californ-ia, paper ganster-a

Full of stuff that means nothin' but "you've been played"

Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up

[Verse 1]
Hi, I want to come and make peace with you
But they won't let me
No, they won't let me through
I don't mind if they a-arrest me
'Cause I'm wearing my Versace
Why can't we just put on a smile and a buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz?
We all might be sick
Whether it's at first or after a few drinks
We're gonna unite, don't think

[Pre-Chorus]
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS

We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya

Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell my mama it's bad karma, I just killed a man
Tell your honor he got to pardon me if I hide my hand
Fuck what you heard, this shit is revolutionary
Fuck what you heard, this is the last illusion, bury
Me with the nerve and ninety-five marksmen
So I can shoot this game until my trigger finger jam
I see red flag, I see blue flag
I pick a color, then make sure I don't give you a pass
You call it gang violence, you call it livin' mad
I called it life, but now I'm like, 'I fuckin' hate it bad'
And so we holler, 'Fuck what you heard
See, we been down for too long
Fuck what you heard, we been tired of doin' wrong
If you got the nerve to man up and kill a man
Then man up double time and shake that adversary's hand, bang

[Hook: Lady Gaga]
Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, this for the hatred in you
This is for that place of darkness they have placed into you
This is for the early coffins of those discriminated
Or racially profiled, I can look you in the eye
And make a vow that I'll never make another assumption
That you'll never be nothin' to me, he fin' if you did the opposite
I'll still run with pleasure
Doin' you the favour of cuttin' through the evil
Kendrick Lamar like God-lover of all people, bang

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Prepare, I descend from the East, my name is Lady Gaga
We partynauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West, my name is Kendrick Lamar
We party nauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya

[Hook: Lady Gaga]
Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high


[Verse 1]
Tryin' to get control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion

[Verse 2]
I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know


[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)

[Bridge]
Where are you?
'Cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Where are you?
'Cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
But I feel you watchin' me
Illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Where were you
'Cause I can't see
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy
I'm over the show
Yeah, at least now I know


[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Oh-oh-oh, you were a perfect illusion
Oh-oh-oh, it was a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion, illusion

[Outro]
Where were you 'cause I can't see it
It was perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me, baby
Somewhere in all the confusion
Dilated, fallin' free
You were so perfect
In a modern ecstasy
You were a, you were a perfect illusion



[Verse 1: Dominique Young Unique]
Yeah, you know I thought it was real but-
Uh I'm finna do my thing
Can't believe, what you did you left me insane
Man, I thought you was a real one
Can't look me in my eyes
You don't say nothing
Damn all these things I done sacrifice
You don't want to let go, boy you fighting for it
Like Mike Tyson for it
I know it wasn't real, man, perfect illusion
All this right here is heat of fusion
Can't complain, lets get to conclusion
I'm winning but you losing
Say what
I'm winning but you losing

[Chorus: Lemon]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion

[Verse 2: Dominique Young Unique]
Heart beating 125 on the meter
Look me in my eyes
I don't never never lie
All this time went by you didn't do it right boy
You was counterfeit, I was authentic
I'm the one always make moves
Sitting here watching you
What you gone do
Getting out of this make me want to dance and groove
Like it was in June

[Chorus: Lemon]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)

You were a perfect illusion
Mistaken for love

Ooh, yeah

[Spoken Outro: Dominique Young Unique]
Hold on, hold on
Uh
While you sitting over there on the couch
Acting like I don't know what's going on
I done been through all your text messages
You been texting that same raggedy girl
Nappy hair, drag foot
I took your necklace
All your jewellery
You know what? I should take all this to the pawn shop
I'm done, you keep cheating over and over and over
What girl gone put up with that? Not me
Uh-uh
I done flock all your credit cards
I shut down your bank account
I'm gonna have the last laugh
[?[
Know dat
I can't take this no more
Get the fuck out my house

Open me up and cut me loose
I come with a purse and new shoes
Am I your type? Am I your type?
(Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)
I've lived in a pink box so long
I am top shelf, they built me strong
Am I your type? Am I your type?
(Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)

[Pre-Chorus]

Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll

Tell me, who dressed you? Where'd you get that hat?
Why is she cryin'? What's the price tag?
Who's that girl, Malibu Gaga?
Looks so sad, what is this saga? (Oh)

Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll

Love game intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody

[Post-Chorus]
Po-po-po-poker face, po-po-poker face
Po-po-po-poker face, po-po-poker face

[Verse 2]
I wanna roll with him
A hard pair, we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I'll get him hot
Show him what I got
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got, yeah

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody

[Bridge]
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying
I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I am marvelous

[Outro]
I'm marvelous, I'm marvelous, I'm marvelous, so marvelous
He can't read my, he can't read my poker face

The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At-At-At night!

It's a quarter after one

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Part 9 - Fireflies]
And I like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake
When I'm asleep
Because everything is never as it seems

Blame it on the goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on the Tron

[Verse 1]
He went to them, they turned away
He just wanted something to eat, a place to love, a place to pray
In God we trust, and it's okay
He said, "I'm black, latin, and gay...
I went to them, they turned away."

[Pre-Chorus]
Where life is holding you down
And you're having trouble finding peace
You gotta be brave
Be brave, until you're bleeding
Where life is holding you hard in a place that it don't want to be
You gotta posh life
'Cause life is all you need

[Chorus]
We live a posh life
And the world says we're not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life
We live a posh life
We're nothing but our leather and our dreams
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life

[Post-Chours]
Posh life
Posh life
Posh life, until we bleed

[Verse 2]
Grew up north of the Florida Bay
Nineteen, moved to the big city to find a dream, to find a way
Ooh, burning concrete of lower east
Inscribing sharpie William's "H"
Passionately only serving him, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Where life is holding you down
And you're having trouble finding peace
You gotta be brave
Be brave, until you're bleeding
Where life is holding you hard in a place that it don't want to be
You gotta posh life
'Cause life is all you need


[Chorus]
We live a posh life
And the world says we're not brave until we bleed

This ain't no chapel, ain't no Pauper's prison
We love this posh life for just one reason
We got each other when the church ain't giving
We love this posh life for just one reason

[Chorus]
We live a posh life
The world says we're not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe
We live a posh life
We're nothing but our leather and our dreams
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life

I like to take control like a man




[Lana Del Rey]
Chromatica, she must go.
The Mantra has ceased, the pain has healed.
She is called back home.
Now, it is her time to live.
Truly free.

[Lady Gaga]
This is my Exodus.
From the suffering that has plagued me for years.
This is my Exodus.




[Verse 1]
Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on, so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives, so everybody sees

[Pre-Chorus]
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I know will love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be your Princess Di, and die with you

[Chorus]
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong, no-ohh
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and I left a note, to know

[Verse 2]
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel, but was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens, and I
I'll do it in the swimming pool, so everybody sees

[Pre-Chorus]
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
I'll need someone to love and save me from myself
So, maybe I'll just keep the shit on on these fancy shoes
I'll be your Princess Di and die with you

[Break]
Princess die
I want to see her cry
Princess die
Princess die
We want to watch her cry
Princess die




[Verse 1]
Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on, so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives, so everybody sees
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself
Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you

[Chorus]
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note

[Verse 3]
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriend's limo
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold
With the paparazzi all swarming around
In my Louis Vuitton white buttoned down
Oh, it's not that deep
So bob your head for another dead blonde whose real prince is in heaven
She just wants to sleep

The final act of life will be my own hands to do
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you


[Verse 1]
I wanna take a little ride
In your leather motorbike
I want you to pump up my ride
'Cause we're drivin' with sass
Want you to pump up my ride
'Cause we're drivin' all night
I like a, a little licky when my lipgloss is sticky
Give me a hickey

[Chorus]
I see you want a little
Something, something
So I'll give you a special
Private Audition
Let's not make a big deal
It's just a Private Audition
Let's keep it secret
It's just a special time

[Verse 2]
Let's take a little ride
Or if you need some more
How about you move it, move it (What?)
If you want me you better prove it, prove it (Let's go)
I need your measurements to know if, know if (What?)
I wanna take you home and do it


[Chorus]
I see you want a little
Something, something
So I'll give you a special
Private Audition
Let's not make a big deal
It's just a Private Audition
Let's keep it secret
It's just a special time

[Bridge]
I see you want me
But, baby, let's keep it secret
I know I'm a bit dreamy
But let's not make it frequent
I see you want me
But, baby, let's keep it secret
I know I'm a bit dreamy
But let's not make it frequent

[Chorus]
I see you want a little
Something, something
So I'll give you a special
Private Audition
Let's not make a big deal

Never let anybody put one there before
My pillow's got your head printed on it
Baby, of all the guys you were my favorite

Don't ask me why
I just can't say goodbye
No, not tonight
No, I just can't say it

You came along, I didn't know of love
But now I know that sometimes it's just not enough
I hear your footsteps in my corridor
But it is just my heart, it's pounding like before

Oh, ratchet sluts!

[Verse 1]
One, two
I think I love you
You got ripped jeans
I'm only nineteen, what do you wanna do?
You got your cigarette
I got my headset
We're two of a kind
You're spades, and I'm diamonds
And you know that you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can see clearly that I am the one you want
But I must admit that I'm everything you're not

[Chorus]
Yeah, I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I cut lines, you wait you turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
Don't shoot
My heart is on mute
Our physical dreams are only skin deep
How do you wanna groove?
Bang, bang
D'you hear my gun ring? (Oh, yeah)
You're mine, you're there, you'll hear that
I am all up inside your head

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you can see clearly that I am the one you want
But I must admit that I'm everything you're not

Yeah, I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I cut lines, you wait you turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Bridge]
You won't forget me when I'm gone
This feels so good, it can't be wrong
I'd recommend a one night stand
I know we're just friends, but you're my kind of man
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Just for tonight

[Chorus]
Even though I'm red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
I know we could be great for tonight
When you're cold, I'll make it burn
You'll never have to wait your turn
Yeah, I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Yeah, I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I'll cut lines, you'll wait your turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight




[Intro: Azealia Banks]
Uh
You know, ah
Ha
Let's go

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Azealia Banks]
Patent leather
6 inch, high heel
Ostrich, platform
Mary Jane, thirty-seven
Red flame (Yes girls, pump it)
Now walk, now walk, now walk
I wanna see you pump it
Now walk, now walk, now walk
(Ha, don't be mad 'cause they always said you'd free-fall)
I wanna see you pump it

[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
Pump it bitch, to the haters a verse
6 inch, lizard skin, alligator, the purse
Shoe game six, six, and steipers and Birks
I like it, I perch
Vixon and viper the first
Viper the first
You like two and a third
Like who is this bird
You like who in the fur
You heard it a her
Little heffa in the flat 10 dollar skirt
Bitch, never spit the stack on the frock of the purse
The buzz of the block, why nah-nah be the word
The stock of the hills
Spit fire flame for real
When I vamp down the catwalk, I pump it for real
Liquorice lipstick, candy coated, the deal

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Azealia Banks]
Patent leather
6 inch high heel
Ostrich, platform
Mary Jane, thirty-seven
Red flame (Yes girls, pump it)
Now walk, now walk, now walk
I wanna see you pump it
Now walk, now walk, now walk
(Ha, don't be mad 'cause they always said you'd free-fall)
I wanna see you pump it

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Pump this, promote this
I know you notice this skill
Notice these high boots plus the focus could kill
Beauty Bambi, young, determined and willed
No previews, baby, it's only premieres

[Bridge: Azealia Banks]
I don't, I don't kn-know what you want
But I know, kn-know that you don't want
None, no you don't want none of me
No, not today
Not today, boy, don't misbehave
Ok, ok

[Verse 3: Azealia Banks]
'Cause it's little A-B, Lady G-A-G-A
Tell your little DJ, better hit that replay
Listen up my nigga when I'm sipping Clicquot
Lemme hit that weed, hey, lemme feel that freak-ay
Finna pop a pill and get that feeling she chased
When I dip and plie
Gimme, gimme leeway
Bitches on my rhythm, off that Heem and he say
He remember me-ay
He remember me-member me

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Azealia Banks]
Patent leather
6 inch high heel
Ostrich, platform
Mary Jane, thirty-seven
Red flame (Yes girls, pump it)
Now walk, now walk, now walk
I wanna see you pump it
Now walk, now walk, now walk
(Ha, don't be mad 'cause they always said you'd free-fall)
I wanna see you pump it


No red shoes
Or yellow road
To follow
No way home

These black boots
On and on
No magic
Here on the ground

Falling off of the world
Into the universe
I could send a message back there
But would that be weird?
It's too far to leave
There's nothing left to do
Lost again
But I'll pretend these
Broke from my red shoes

No red shoes
On my own
But here I go
In a pink balloon

Close my eyes
One, two, three
I'm flying to a pink balloon


Falling off of the world
Into the universe
I could send a message back there
But would that be weird?
It's too far to leave
There's nothing left to do
Lost again
But I'll pretend these
Broke from my red shoes

I'm completely numb, why you acting dumb?
I won't blame myself 'cause we both know you were the one

Then I sit inside it, wondering if I'll behave
It's a game I play, and I hate to say
You're the worst thing and the best thing that's happened to me

I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say

Does it matter, does it matter? You had the gun
You had the gun
You had the gun
You had the gun

[Chorus]
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay

In the middle of the night, he starts to get feisty
Let's get into trouble, lots of trouble
There are killers and blonde bunnies
They dance for money

My heart beats just like a cherry soda in the summer
Go, go, go
Don't be difficult about it
Get off it

Off the wall (get your ass)
Off the wall (throw that girl)
Against the wall
Retro physical
Off the wall (get your ass)
Off the wall (work that boy)
So sexual
Retro physical

Everyone is famous
Running 'round real aimlessly
We dance for the garage team
In between this spaces, happiness can trace it down
We're not gonna leave this town
In between this spaces, happiness can trace it down
We're not gonna leave this town


We gon' grab the mics and get 'em off the wall
So everybody in here can stop snoring
We gon' grab the mics and get 'em off the wall
So everybody in here can stop snoring

Off the wall (get your ass)

[Intro]
What do you say we get outta here kid?

[Verse 1]
One lost lady and the radio creep
Got your hands in my pockets while you spinnin' the beat
The vinyl spins fast while we trippin' on that
She said ''we can't stand still"
One trick bunny and a haunting man
Got lost in the woods with a gun in the hand
She said ''hey love child, take me back''
I said ''we can't stand still"

[Chorus]
Shake your head cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)

[Verse 2]
Heard a story 'bout the medicine man
Drove straight to the coast in his minivan
He learned the ways of the local dudes
He said ''I can't stand still"
Missy Brown went to pristine high
Met the medicine man for a token around
She said ''It's been so long since we got down''
He said ''I can't stand still''

[Chorus]
Shake your head cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names
Feel so retrosexual

[Bridge]
The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round
The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round
What do you saw? Get outta here kid!

[Chorus]
Shake your head cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)
Feel so retrosexual, sexual, sexual, sexual
Sexual


[Intro]
I'm not bad, I just sound that way!

[Verse 1]
All the girls, they like their presents like their presents
When boys wrap them up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
Doesn't matter if they're precious or expensive if they're well thought out
Sexed up, wrapped right
Every time, get in line, and give me mine
We like black, white, big, striped, polka-dotted, cafe-lotted
Presents come in many sizes
Wrap them up in ribbons

[Chorus]
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up

[Verse 2]
I'm not a Hallmark card expression
Need material attention
Wrapped in ribbons, Richard Simmons
Silly ribbons, ribbons, ribbons!
If you can't afford the best
Don't be stressed, take a rest
Get a job, do it right
It's my birthday all night
We like black, white, big, striped, famous, super-sized ribbons
Don't care what you put inside them
Wrap it all in ribbons
It's the lifestyle that I like
I'll give you yours, you give me mine
But don't forget to wrap them up in pretty, pretty ribbons


[Chorus]
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up

[Verse 3]
Only difference between downtown and uptown
Is therapy and valium
Therapy and valium
Not lying when I say this, there's a price to being famous
Yeah, it's therapy and valium
Therapy and valium

[Bridge]
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up
It's not complicated, just a fashion statement
Everybody wrap it up
Everybody wrap it up


[Chorus]
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up in ribbons
Wrap them presents up

[Outro]
Wrap...
Wrap them presents up, wrap them presents up
Wrap...



Hold her hand through the black light
Baby, it's a forest land of trick slides
Honey just take your time close her eyes

"I'm scared", she whispered as she runs to hide
Into a back room where she paints on a smile
She hears a sound, she hears a sound

It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, uh-oh
She waited for love
But there wasn't anybody around
So she left town with the rockshow

Keep it cool at the freakshow
Baby, it's a happy place; if you lose it, honey
Just take your time, close his eyes

"Touch me", he whispered as he walks to the light
From the window, there's visions of a house in the night
He hears a sound, he hears a sound

It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, uh-oh
She waited for love
But there wasn't anybody around
So she left town with the rockshow

Hold her, tell her that you need her
Please undress her slowly, uh-oh
Never hold the girl too tightly
She can't breathe when you speak
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!

It could have been love
It could have been anybody
Anybody, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
We waited for love
But there wasn't anybody around
So we left town with the rockshow
Rock show, rock show, rockshow

[Intro]
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, baby

[Verse 1]
Last time I thought we had this talk
Boy, you were getting ready to leave
I thought, baby, you were done
'Cause for a while, you could barely look at me
This time, I thought that we'd be fine
That I'd forget the things that you said
I tried crossing out your words
But baby, you can not forget the past (Oh, oh babe)
Cannot forget the past (Oh, oh)
Still, baby...

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
The second time around

[Verse 2]
We tried going back to Joe's
That always was our favorite place
Long rides, baby, by the coast
Do you remember where we stayed?
Last time, we were hangin' out
You were acting kind of estranged
Now it's the second time around
I'm sorry, now it's me that feels this way
(My heart just keeps on turning)
It's me that feels this way, babe (Oh, oh babe)
And now you are the one that is hurting

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around

[Bridge]
I'm not sure the best way to say this
But I can't pretend to love you no more, babe
This ferris wheel's got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us, baby
Not meant for us, baby
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love, you see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around
The second time around


[Verse 1]
(Last night)
Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty)
All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here
(It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here
(It was kind of trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams


[Verse 2]
We could be caught
(I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
('Cause I'm broken)
Let's white
(By the one before)
Glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here
(And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!

Don't stop the party (Making love in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Making love in my sex dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you

[Bridge]
You could turn to stone
Or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

[Spoken Interlude]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!

When we bumped this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies

[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Baby let's get high, John Wayne


[Verse 2]
Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
1-2 ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight
I fool myself
Swirl around as if I'm someone else
Your hands are mine
I do a trick
Pretend that I am you until it clicks
I come alive
Come alive

[Pre-Chorus]
In the fire I call your name out
(call your name out, call your name out)
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh) (call your name out)
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out
(we broke, racin' through the moonlight)
Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne


[Chorus]
(dat - doo - deet - doe)
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby let's get high, John Wayne
(dat - doo - deet - doe)
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby let's get high, John Wayne

[Bridge]
So here I go
To the eye
(Come on, be my baby, come on)
Of the storm
(Come on, be my baby, come on)
(Come on, be my baby, come on)
Just to feel your love
(Baby don't cry, Baby don't cry)
(Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely)
(Knock me over)
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
(Here I go)

I'm singin'
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely


[Post-Chorus]
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown
(We push and pull like a magnet do)
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown
Tap down those boots while I beat around
(I'm in love with your body)
Let's funk downtown
(And now my bedsheets smell like you)
Tap down those boots while I beat around
(I'm in love with your body)
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body

I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
When I was young, I prayed for lightning
My mother said it would come and find me
I found myself without a prayer
I lost my love and no one cared
When I was young, I prayed for lightning

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Yeah, I looked with my face up to the sky
But I saw nothing there, no, no, nothing there
Yeah, I stared while my eyes filled up with tears
But there was nothing there, no, no, nothing

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I heard one sine from above (Oh)
I heard one sine from above (Oh)
Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was love, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Healed my heart, heard a sine
Healed my heart, heard a sine


[Verse 2: Elton John & Both]
When I was young, I felt immortal
And not a day went by without a struggle
I lived my days just for the nights
I lost myself under the lights
When I was young, I felt immortal

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Elton John]
Yeah, I looked with my face up to the sky
But I saw nothing there, no, no, nothing there

[Verse 1]
I came down the mountain
Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way sayin' forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For somethin' he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold

[Verse 2]
Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothin' more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece
From Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for gettin' what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you


[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold

[Bridge]
I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold

"I'm not your Billie Jean"

Billie Jean is still pregnant
I'm not worthy of you, liar
I'm not worthy of you, sire."

The next Michael Jackson"

"You're the king and I'm not worthy."

"So don't leave me yet."

Smile though your heart is breaking
Smile even though it's aching
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you

[Verse 2]
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll see that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

[Bridge]
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-da-da-do-do
Da-bo-da-ba-ba-ba-da-bo
Da-da-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da

[Outro]
You'll see that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha

[Verse 1]
I love that lavender blonde
The way she moves, the way she walks
I touch myself, can't get enough
And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears and all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Just give in
Don't give up, baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me
Just (Just) know when (Know when)
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend, yeah


[Chorus]
Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die
Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die, and it's alright

Aha-aha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha

[Verse 2]
I am as vain as I allow
I do my hair, I gloss my eyes
I touch myself all through the night
And when something falls out of place (Place)
I take my time, I put it back
I touch myself 'til I'm on track


[Pre-Chorus]
Just give in
Don't give up, baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me
Just (Just) know when (Know when)
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend, yeah

[Chorus]
Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die
Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh
(Eh-eh, eh-eh) So happy I could die, and it's alright

[Interlude]
So happy I could die, and it's alright
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
So happy I could die, and it's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha-aha


[Chorus]
Happy in the club, with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time

Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh

Be your best friend, yeah, I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever

[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and I fear this time there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus 1]
And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
'Cause your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you, no

[Chorus 2]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Outro]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never reach the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
Shallow now




[Verse 1]
Wait, I think it's time
Your fire's lit and so is mine
Go turn out the light
Don't be afraid
Tonight's the night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I won't, I won't try to change you
But I will, I will if you want me to
Yeah, it always brings me down when you're not around
I still need you

[Chorus]
Oh, you do something for me, baby
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, you do something crazy to me
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
And I feel so down when you're not around

[Verse 2]
Boy, we're almost there
I'll lay your clothes over my chair
Pull the shades down low
We're both ready to lose control

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I won't, I won't try to tame you
But I will, I will if you want me to
Yeah, it always brings me down when you're not around
I still need you

[Chorus]
Oh, you do something for me, baby
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, you do something crazy to me
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
And I feel so down when you're not around

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I won't, I won't try to tame you
But I will, I will if you want me to
Yeah, it always brings me down when you're not around
I still need you

[Chorus]
Oh, you do something for me, baby
And I cannot control it lately
You do something for me
Oh, you do something for me baby
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, you do something crazy to me
And I cannot control it, baby
La la la la la la la la
You always bring me down




[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You make me feel so pretty
When I'm not feeling so cool today
Yeah, you pull me out when you know that I'm afraid
Something about you
It dries up every tear in my way
And when I trip myself on the sidewalk
You put my boots back on me, babe
'Cause you're my cowboy, you're my everything
And you know how to get me

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm feeling up
Sometimes I'm down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes I'm moving fast
Sometimes I'm slow
You know, what'll make me go
Sometimes I am the happy girl  you love
Sometimes I don't feel good enough
Sometimes
Sometimes
Oh, you're there when I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
When I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I ask myself these questions
About you that I cannot explain
How you ride with me when you know that I'm to blame
You've proved your love
I don't need to hear the words that you say
But I know you say them anyway
Just to keep me feeling sane
And my worries become yesterday
Baby, you get me

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm feeling up
Sometimes I'm down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes I'm moving fast
Sometimes I'm slow
You know, what'll make me go
Sometimes I am the happy girl you love
Sometimes I don't feel good enough
Sometimes
Sometimes
Oh, you're there when I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
When I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Refrain]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh
Ahh

[Verse 1]
I can't believe what you said to me
Last night we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby, you gave up
You gave up
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans
With your long hair and your cigarette stained lies

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

[Chorus]
I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

[Verse 2]
I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams
Bubble dreams
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know that it's so complicated
But I'm a loser in love, so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts of all my wrecked up friends

[Chorus]
I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless so speechless
I'll never love again
Oh, friend, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

[Refrain]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh
Ahh

[Bridge]
And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up? Could I give it all up for you?
And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up, if I promise, boy, to you?
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again (Ahh)

[Chorus 2]
So speechless (Ahh)
You left me speechless, so speechless
Will you ever talk again?
Oh, boy, why you so speechless? (Speechless, baby)
You've left me speechless, so speechless

[Outro]
Some men may follow me
But you choose "death and company"
Why you so speechless?
Oh-oh-oh-oh




Never seen so many purple clouds
The situation's inside out

Love sick girl
Where does it hurt?
Where does it hurt?
The temperature's goodbye
But don't look me in the eye

'Cause you know
I spin U around
Spin U around
Spin U around

Spin U around
[+2]

Body lays inside the broken glass
How did we make such a mess?

Love sick girl
Where does it hurt?
Where does it hurt?
The temperature's goodbye
But don't look me in the eye

'Cause you know
I spin U around
Spin U around
Spin U around

Spin U around
[+2]

Love's not something you can pick
Sound of phobic music, sick
I get lost in everything you say
Something 'bout you and me
Is made of steam, a little mean
But I prefer us both that way

I spin U around
Spin U around
Spin U around
[Repeat]

Around
And around
And around
And around
And around
[Repeat]

Around, around, around


Never seen so many purple clouds
The situation's inside out

Love sick girl
Where does it hurt?
Where does it hurt?
The temperature's goodbye
But don't look me in the eye

'Cause you know I
Spin U around
Spin U around
Spin U around

Spin U around
Spin U around
Spin U around

Body lays inside the broken glass
How did we make such a mess?

Love sick girl
Where does it hurt?
Where does it hurt?
The temperature's goodbye
But don't look me in the eye


'Cause you know I
Spin U around
Spin U around

Love's not something you can pick

I get lost in everything you say

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Rollin' up to the club on the weekend
Styling out to the beat that you're freakin'
Fantasize I'm the track that you're tweakin'
Blow my heart up

Run it back with original flavor
Cue me up, I'm the 12 on your table
I'm so starstruck

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Baby, now that we're alone, gotta request
Would you make me number one on your playlist?
Got your Dre headphones with the left side on
Wanna scratch me back and forth, back and forth? Uh-huh
Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor

Hey, lil mamma, like really, really is that him?
I done seen you before
What you got on them big rims?
Enter that cash flow
I'm like, baby, you don't trip
So shawty, say hand over your signature right here
Like adjust the dotted line, and I'm supposed to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down
She so starstruck, the gal all stuck
I shoulda had an overdose, too many Starbucks
Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Stunners who let the top back on the Chevy Impala
Hummers and all that, fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars?
But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagger, there go the dagger
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after

I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up

Got no plans, got no clothes
Got no piano, we got no shows
No, I got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you

Got no flights outta here
Got no TV shows until next year
No, I got nothing to do
But to be stuck on you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Baby, you're my liquor
I'm addicted to you
So I'll just be stuck on, stuck on fucking you
Stuck on fucking you

I don't ever want just another boy or a girl to love

[Bridge]
Got no plans, got no flights
While we're here, no TV shows
But we got mice in the kitchens
But we don't care 'cause we're in love
Get in the shower
I'll meet you there
I bought you some hippie shit from the Deli down the stairs
Love it when my man smells so good


[Verse 5]
Don't forget me baby
Don't forget me when I leave and go on tour
'Cause I know your life would be a snore
You'd be all stuck fucking this hooker-whore
This hooker, whore

[Verse 6]
Got no nothing
You're in the next room
You fell asleep on my tour bus while me and Fernando and Paul and Justin and Dave are making music
But I miss you

[Verse 7]
The fridge is broke
And drinking warm champagne
But we don't care cause we're in Minnesota
And we're sold out show again
And it's a sold show again

[Outro]
Okay, just stop here, I could go on forever

[Verse 1]
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me

Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out

I gotta find that peace, is it too late or
Could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you (Even if we break in two)

Nowhere
Yeah, we're goin' nowhere fast
Maybe this time
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
C-c-c-crazy (crazy)
Get your ass in my bed
Baby, you'll be just my summer boyfriend
(Summerboy...)

[Chorus]
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top's comin' o-o-off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up, and I'm not around
I've got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll still have the summer after all

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you might start a fight
But I'm happy pretending we're alright
Sunglasses cover up my green eyes
My martini glistens, yeah, while checking out other guys
(Summerboy...)

[Chorus]
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top's coming o-o-off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up, and I'm not around
I've got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll still have the summer after all

[Bridge]
Hey there, Summerboy
Let's go for a drive
Take me for a ride
Never gonna close our eyes
Hey there, Summerboy
I'm a busy girl
Don't got too much time
Hurry up, before I change my mind
Hey there, Summerboy
I'm taking off my heels
Let's go for a run
Have a little summer fu-u-un
Have a little summer fu-u-un
(Summerboy...)

[Chorus]
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top's poppin' o-o-off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up, and I'm not around
You've got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll still have the summer after...
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
I have got my, summer-summerboy
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around
I have got my, summer-summerboy
And we'll still have the summer after all

[Outro]
I've got my-
Yes, I've got my-

[Verse 1]
The winter
Doesn't want you
It haunts you
Summer serenadings
A long way
From this frozen place
Your face
Our teacher
Our preacher
It's nature
And like flowers growing in a bomb crater
From nothing
A rose
It grows

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We have one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love
A summer of love

[Verse 2]
We're freezing
We're leaving
Believing
That all we need is to head over somewhere
In a summer
To come
So we run

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We have one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love
A summer of love

[Bridge]
Oh and when all is lost
When all is lost we find out what remains
Oh the same oceans crossed
For some it's pleasure, for some it's pain

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
In the rubble of Aleppo
Flowers blooming in the shadows
For a summer of love
A summer of love

[Lisa Simpson]:
I used to think that I was stupid
Worthless weak and wrong
A mockingbird without a song
I was small inside
Left and ride
On a one-way train to be Milhouse's bride

End this song, end it right here!

I love NPR and jazz guitars
And may design a solar car
That's right
I'm Lisa Simpson superstar

Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?

Behind the aura, behind the aura, clap your hands..

Wanna meet at my place?

Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams
Making love in my Sexxx Dreams

Or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

[Break: Spoken]
One of my favorite memories with my grandpa and my grandma right around Thanksgiving, and it's actually leading up to Christmas time, is that they make these cookies called pizzelle's. If you're Italian, you know what those are. They're like really flat waffles, but they're really thin and crisp. My grandpa would always make the pizzelle and would always work the machine, and everybody had to "I got it, outta the way, outta the way, outta the way". That was my grandfathers thing, he made the pizzelle's, so I don't know why, but right now, I'm just thinking about the Italian cookies

I can't help myself
I'm addicted to a life of material

Give me something I wanna be
Retro glamour, Hollywood, yes, we live for the...

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame)

Isn't it a shame, shame, baby?
A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby
The fame, fame

[Verse 2]
I can see myself in the movies, with my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind
And whatever else you'd like to shoot, you decide
All we care about is
Pornographic girls on film and body plastic
Give me something
I wanna see
Television, and hot blondes in odd positions

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame)
Doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous

I can't help myself
I'm addicted to a life of material

[Intro: Cher]
I don't know why you hurt inside,
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest thing to me

[Verse 1: Cher]
I don't wa-wanna waste another day
Without telling you
That, baby, you're great
And I can see it written on your face
G-R-E-A-T is something you can't fake

[Pre-Chorus: Cher]
'Cause when I'm with you, I fall apart (fall apart)
To heal your permanently broken heart (broken heart)
Baby, you're the greatest to me
No, no matter what, what, what

[Chorus: Cher & Lady Gaga]
I don't know why you hurt inside,
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest thing to me
And when you're feeling like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are the greatest, greatest thing to me


[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
When all your thoughts are dark and insecure
I'll build you a light
'Cause baby, I'm sure that loving you has made me better
I'll take all your shadows and make sure that you shine

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Cher]

[Verse 1: Tony Bennett + Lady Gaga]
She gets too hungry for dinner at 8 (I'm starving)
She loves the theater, but she never comes late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why this chick is a tramp
She doesn't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
And I definitely won't dish the dirt with the rest of those girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

[Chorus 1: Tony Bennett + Lady Gaga]
I love the free fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
Oh, I'm so broke, it's oke
I hate California
It's crowded and damp
That's why the lady is a tramp (I'm a tramp)

[Verse 2: Tony Bennett + Lady Gaga + Both]
Sometimes I go to Coney Island
Oh, the beach is divine
And I love the Yankees
Jeter is just fine
I follow Rogers and Hart
She sings every line
That's why the lady is a tramp
I love the prize fight that isn't a fake (no fakes)
And I love to rowboat with you and your wife in Central Park Lake
She goes to the opera and stays wide awake (yes I do)
That's why this lady is a tramp

[Verse 3: Tony Bennett + Lady Gaga]
She likes the green (green) grass (grass) under her shoes
What can I lose?
'Cause I got no dough (Oh no?)
I'm all alone when I blow out my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp, go

[Chorus 2: Tony Bennett + Lady Gaga + Both]
I love your free fresh
I love your handkerchief in my hair
Life without care
But I'm so broke, that's oke
Hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
That's why this lady is a tramp
That's why the lady is a tramp


[Spoken Monologue]
When I was younger, I was at some point, born.
I grew in both IQ and EQ and as that happened I discovered that I was living in two realities at once.
They fought all the time and yet I made space for both of them for a reason I can't explain.
One reality I experienced was my Earth reality. The day, today, painting of what I was taught was my natural state in life.
At the time I also experienced a dream simultaneously and this dream was in combat with my Earth reality at all times.
A vision where I perform my thoughts for the world, a world where I mattered in a different way.
A world where I was valued for different things.
And in this world I was kind and that kindness spread through people, through sound.
This was the birth of Chromatica.

Love is an element on Chromatica, like earth, wind, fire, water.
It's a natural force and it's the only way that I can organize this super organism that is the Earth, it's by making it one whole thing.
Where time and linear structure don't matter, they don't exist.
We are all love.
I am love.
So it's everything around us.
It's how we work.
It's the thing we both initiate and respond to.
It's why everything happens, both good and bad.
It's the only way that I can make things simple.
And why shouldn't it be simple?
I breathe in and out love.
I don't believe it to be a choice other than I choose to breathe.
That is Chromatica.
It is how I do hard things.
It's neither right nor wrong nor is it greater or less than any other perspective on life.
No one thing is greater than another.
Kindness rules all things.
It simply is and it's mine.
You can have it too, though.
My best friend says "Sharing is caring" but we both know that I don't need to share your perspective with you for us both to care.


The Manifesto of Chromatica it's never-ending, I cannot finish it here.
It would be declaring I would never make music or be Lady Gaga again, which would mean I would stop being myself.
This manifesto finale marks the new beginning of my life.
One where I acknowledge that sound is my life force and that Lady Gaga is the mystery that carries it.
Chromatica can't end, it's how I make sense of things.
That's what you should tell people if they ask you what it is.
And for what is worth I think we all need that to make sense of things even if at times it feels absurd.



[Spoken Monologue]
This is The Manifesto of Mother Monster
On G.O.A.T, a Government Owned Alien Territory in space
A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place
But the birth was not finite, it was infinite
As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began
It was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal
And thus began the beginning of the new race
A race within the race of humanity
A race which bears no prejudice, no judgment
But boundless freedom
But on that same day, as the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse
Another more terrifying birth took place... the birth of evil
And as she herself split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces
The pendulum of choice began its dance
It seems easy, you imagine
To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good
But she wondered, "How can I protect something so perfect without evil?"


[Verse 1]
Oh, tonight I'm gonna show them what I'm made of, oh
The killer queen inside me's coming to say "hello"
Oh, tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you, I'd watch them all be burned
Woah, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

[Chorus]
I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen

[Verse 2]
I am wind and hurricane, the stormy sky and rain
When you run dry, I'll flood your pain
Woah, woah
In between the moments of the lady I've become
A voice speaks through the noise like drums
Rum-pum-pum-pum

[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

[Chorus]
I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen
The que ee-ee-ee-ee ee-ee-eeen
The queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen

[Bridge]
Starry night
Come inside me, like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to Heaven's door
I will fly
On a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix, so you can remind them of the dream I bore

[Outro]
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh


[Verse 1]
The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years

The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds that rise
From the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before


My heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

[Verse 2]
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

[Verse 3]
Edelweiss, Edelweiss
Bless my homeland forever

[Verse 4]
Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
'Til you find your dream

A dream that will need
All the love you can give
Every day of your life
For as long as you live


Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
'Til you find your dream

I can feel my heart beating in your hands
My aura and yours meeting in this dance
Pull the trigger I'm ready it's showtime!

It takes nothing to start a war
But baby tell me, can you stop it just like that?
It takes nothing to take it that far
Oh baby tell me, can you ever go back?
The bright days are gone, you let the clouds overcome
It's getting colder overtime
The music has stopped, and the stars seem to fall
I wish I could live without your touch

But you're inside my veins
Burning deep within my brain
You know it hurts, that it feels like hell
Why don't you just care
The way I care?

The way I care
The way I care
Why don't you just care
The way I care?

It takes nothing to walk away
But baby tell me, how can I when I'm still there?
It takes too much to drink this pain
Oh baby tell me, will I drown from it?
I'm right on the edge, under your control
It's getting silent overtime
Why don't you tell me it'll be fine?


But you're inside my veins
Burning deep within my brain
You know it hurts, that it feels like hell
Why don't you just care
The way I care?

The way I care
The way I care
Why don't you just care
The way I care?

I stood with you when there was fire and no rain
I stood with you when the demons called your name (x2)

Oh babe..

But you're inside my veins
Burning deep within my brain
You know it hurts, that it feels like hell
Why don't you just care
Why don't you just care
Why don't you
The way I care?

The way I care
The way I care
Why don't you just care
The way I care



They all laughed at Christopher Columbus,
When he said the world was round,
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound,
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother,
When they said man could fly,
They told Marconi,
Wireless was a phony,
It's the same old cry

They laughed at me wanting you,
Said I was reaching for the moon,
But, oh, you came through,
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could happy,
They laughed at us and how,
Ho, ho, ho,
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at Rockefeller Center,
Now they're fighting to get in,
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin,
They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat,
Hershey and his chocolate bar,
Ford and his Lizzie, kept the laughers busy,
That's how people are

They laughed at me wanting you,
Said it would be hello-goodbye,
But, oh, you came through,
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together,
Darling, take a bow

Ho, ho, ho,
Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee,
Let's have the past laugh,
Ha, ha, ha,
Who's got the last laugh now?
Ha-ha


[Verse 1]
You tell me it gets better, it gets better in time
You say I'll pull myself together, pull it together, you'll be fine
Tell me, what the hell do you know? What do you know?
Tell me how the hell could you know? How could you know?

[Chorus 1]
'Til It happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real
No, it won't be real, won't know how it feels

[Verse 2]
You tell me hold your head up, hold your head up and be strong
'Cause when you fall you gotta get up, you gotta get up and move on
Tell me how the hell could you talk, how could you talk?
'Cause until you walk where I walk, this is no joke

[Chorus 2]
'Til it happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real
(How could you know?)
No it won't be real
(How could you know?)
Won't know how I feel

[Bridge]
'Til your world burns and crashes
'Til you're at the end, the end of your rope
'Til you're standing in my shoes
I don't wanna hear a thing from you, from you, from you
'Cause you don't know


[Chorus 3]
'Til it happens to you, you don't know how I feel, how I feel
How I feel
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real
(How could you know?)
No it won't be real
(How could you know?)
Won't know how it feels

[Outro]
Til it happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
(How could you know?)
Til it happens you
You won't know how I feel

I'll undress you, 'cause you're tired
Next to the red flame fire
When you fall asleep in Tokyo
Surround with fancy things
Here we can get anything
You could ever want, we're in Tokyo

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will with you in Tokyo tonight
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
I will be right by your side

I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you know, I'll

I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be in Tokyo (In Tokyo)
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be in Tokyo

[Verse 1]
In the white room, with the yellow chair
Was her baby, with his angry stare
In the white room, through their violet eyes
Shes just a baby taken by surprise

[Chorus]
They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a-ding
They never really knew it then
How to do it when
Ring, ring ring-a--ding

[Verse 2]
In the white room, she had jet black hair
She held his head down, but he left her there
In the white room, you could hear their cries
Sound of a baby heard his very first lie

Midnight at the glamour show on a Sunday Night
Everybody drink a lot of whiskey and wine
We dance like no tomorrow
We're on Burlesque time
But everybody's got to work tomorrow at nine

[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don't mess up my hair
Love me l-love me crazy, but don't get too attached
This is a brief affair

So go ahead and label me whatever you like
But nothings quite as sexy as a woman is fine

Touch me, t-touch me, baby, but don't mess up my hair (oh)
Love me l-love me crazy, but don't get too attached

I'm coming around
I'm sipping on Andre, it's time
I heard the cutie's in the back, start in the p-party line
Let's dance, quick round
We're in the vanity house
We're covered in sequins, diamonds
We're happy 'cause we're shining

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
My missionaries hidin' in foreign trenches

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Like just The Doors' Love Her Madly and let her in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my blonde head on a silver plate
Just a GaGa on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be queen?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth

For some reason that I can't explain
I know Yves Saint Laurent, no, he won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
The fame won't change us if we don't let it

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Mary won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Ruled the world
Ruled the world




KANYE: Welcome to our show, waking up with Kimye, haaaaaaaa! I'm Kanye West and this is my girl Kim Kardashian. What better way to start off your morning than with our energy, my opinions, and the sound of Kim's voice

KIM: Hii guuuyss

KANYE: Y'all like this dress? I picked it out. This ain't no Kris Humphries basketball wife Kim

KIM: Yeah

KANYE: I turned this woman into an artiste

KIM: Yeah

KANYE: A philosopher

KIM: Okay...

KANYE: An intergalactic icon of creativity, huh?!

KIM: I'm also blonde now!

KANYE: Now give it up for our hen-house family band, the Kardashian 11

KIM: Hi you guys

THE KARDASHIANIAN 11: Hiiiii

KANYE: All playing instruments match to the musical abilities. We got Khloe on triangle, Kourtney on triangle, Kendall on a box of rice, Rob on the Simon, Kris Jenner on the clapping of her own hands. And also on triangles several other satellite Kardashians that I'm excited to meet at Thanksgiving.

Alright, our first segment highlights the latest innovations in artistic expression, it's called "What Kim Made".

["What Kim Made" Intro]

KANYE: Show the world what you created, baby

KIM: I made this, it's a macaroni necklace

KANYE: Y'all hear that?! She just changed the game. Food is jewelry now, haaaaaaaa! Ok, time to bring out our first guest. You can do this baby, come on

KIM: Ok. Our first guest works at the Apple store in the Beverly Center. Please welcome Karen

KANYE: No-no-no-no-now, Karen please tell the people what you do at the Apple store

KAREN: I help customers fix problems with their Apple computers

KANYE: Haaaaaaaa! Haaaaaaaa! And this somehow makes you deserving of the title genius?

KIM: Uh oh

KAREN: Well, I work at the Genius bar so it's just a term Apple came up with

KANYE: You do not deserve the title of genius! You can't just throw that term around! Mark Zuckerberg is a genius, I am a genius, I am a God, Kim is a genius! Tell him about your invention idea, baby!

KIM: Ok, uh you know how the people who wash your clothes sometimes have to go home, but you have a top you still need to wash? Well what if there was a machine in your house that could wash your clothes for you?

KAREN: You mean a washing machine?

KIM: Oh, that's a good name for it!

KANYE: You see? We earn the right to be called genius. Between the two of us we have won 19 Grammies, sold over 21,000,000 albums and won best male rapper artist at the NAACP awards, haaaaaaaa!

KIM: Yay we did it!

KAREN: Um I'm a little confused, I was told I was here to fix a Macbook error

KANYE: Yeah that's right, Kim's laptop broke

KIM: I saw an apple on it so I dipped it in caramel

KAREN: So do you guys need me to fix it or can I go please?

KANYE: Naw, uh you know cause uh, right now it's time for our next segment ok? Our next segment when we take an in depth look at the world of fashion. Frumpy white girl, get up and get next to my fiance cause it's time for "Kim Wore It Better"!

["Kim Wore It Better" Intro]

KAREN: Wore it better? How can you even compare us we're not even wearing the same thing?

KANYE: And that's a damn shame, cause you standing next to a style Titan. Baby, what do I always call you?

KIM: The Michael Jordan of wearing clothes

KANYE: Yeah, ok. Let's analyze the two, alright. Kim is wearing a Givenchy piece that she initially did not want to wear so I had to put her in it while she was asleep. It's sexy while at the same still says "Hey, this girl knows how to read". And uh, Karen's wearing this garbage.

KAREN: *nervous groan*

KANYE: Kim wore it better! What do you have to say for yourself Karen?

KAREN: Well first of all this is my work uniform...

KIM: Ewww work

KAREN: But honestly I don't care about fashion. I think people who try too hard with their outfits are maybe hiding something. Like c'mon dress like a person. I'm a jorts and jelly shoes kind of girl

KANYE: Alright, um, I'm gon' pretend you did not just say that. We're gonna take a quick break, when we come back Kim is going to teach you about Japanese paper folding art of Origami, the art of it, so..

KIM: It's a snowball!


[Intro]
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique

Top cutting the cake till the sugar flow, stop, don't stop (it's a record)
Drip drip drip, baby watch me melt
Take a sip sip sip, but it doesn't help me stop, can't stop (it's a record)

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of summer
Don't say that you need me

Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in the blender
Yeah baby we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer

We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique

Drip drip drip, baby watch me melt
Take a sip sip sip, but it doesn't help, it's bad, so bad (it's a record)


[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of summer

Before the rock show was o-o-over
Here we go-go, sir
We're making time, it's a record, record, record

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of the summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of the summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in the blender
Yeah baby we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer

Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer

Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)

[Verse 1]
She does a dirty dance
To a song about a bad romance
Meet a damaged girl, meet a damaged guy
He's a local star, stealing glares of her across the bar
See a damaged girl, see a damaged guy

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take this panicked feeling
The way you look at me's a knife
I can't take this panicked feeling
I can't take this panicked feeling

[Chorus]
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
They were neighbours then
Back then, they weren't even friends
Watch a damaged girl, watch a damaged guy
Fearing stories when a couple crashed, dangerous affair
Watching them tear up, the DJ cries, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take this panicked feeling
The way you look at me's a knife
I can't take this panicked feeling
I can't take this panicked feeling

[Chorus]
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh
I wish that we could just be lovers
We could be lovers
Whoa, oh, oh

When we get to do it all again (Do it all again)
Until the credits roll
We got another goal to show
And we can do it all again

*Penguins squawk*

[KERMIT, MISS PIGGY FOZZIE, GONZO, SCOOTER, ROWLF]
We're doing a sequel

[KERMIT]
Let's give it a go

[TONY BENNETT]
With Hollywood stars

[LADY GAGA]
And more one-liner cameos

[KERMIT, MISS PIGGY FOZZIE,GONZO, SCOOTER,ROWLF]
We're doing a sequel

[BUNSEN, spoken]
I don't mean to be a stickler, but this is the seventh sequel to our original motion picture

[MUPPETS]
We're doing a sequel
Let's give it a shot

[KERMIT]
All we need now is a half-decent plot

[GONZO, spoken]
Got it! An epic love story between a handsome long-nosed purple thing and a beautiful chicken. "Gonzo with the Wind."

[KERMIT, spoken]
Uh, does anybody have any better ideas?

[FOZZIE, spoken]
Oh, oh, it's about the Muppets getting back to stop an evil oil baron from demolishing the old studio!

[KERMIT]
(spoken)
Fozzie, did you even watch our last film?!

[LEW ZEALAND]
(spoken)
How about one of those fish-out-of-water movies?

[KERMIT]
(spoken)
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that, Lew

[MISS PIGGY, spoken]
It's about a frog who marries a beautiful perfect pig. And they have to kiss each other. A lot!

[KERMIT]
(spoken)
Uhhhhh...

[SWEDISH CHEF]
(in mock Swedish)
How about a film about the existential conundrum of religious faith?

[KERMIT]
(spoken)
I don't think Americans watch subtitled films

[WALDORF]
(spoken)
How about a movie where you don't make a movie?

[STATLER]
(spoken)
And we all get to go home early?

[BOTH]
*laughs*

[KERMIT]
(spoken)
Good grief

[ROWLF, spoken]
It's about a lonely dog. And one night, he sees something he should never have seen, and he has to live with a terrible secret

[KERMIT]
(spoken)
Uh, that sounds a little dark, Rowlf

[DOMINIC BADGUY, spoken]
Kermit, how about the Muppets go on a world tour?

[KERMIT]
(spoken)
That's perfect!

[MUPPETS]
I thought it was the end
But no my friends this is
When we get to do it all again
Until the credits roll
We got another go to show
That we can do it all again

We're doing a sequel
It's more of the same

[KERMIT]
Let's give it a name

[WALTER]
How 'bout "The Muppets Again!"?

[COMPANY]
It's the Muppets again!
With "The Muppets Again!"
It's "The... Muppets... Again!"




Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
Or whatever that means
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lie in my bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I"am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs
What's going on?
When I say, hey yeah yeah hey hey yeah yay
I say hey, what's going on?
When I say, hey yeah yeah hey hey yeah yay
Yah yah yah hiya
I say hey, what's going on?
Ooh, ooh ooh
And I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time, in this institution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?
Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

[Verse 1]
Come on, strap on your sex bomb
Yeah baby, with your left arm
It's right on, yeah baby, press it
One, two, three
We got a thing, we feel it naturally

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got that kind of fashion
Chemical attraction
Ruby red lips and her eyes real low

[Chorus]
You're gonna miss her when she go, go, go
Shakin' her hips in her mothers clothes
You're gonna miss her when she go, go, go
It's just a question of the girl's affection
Now watch her as she go

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got that kind of fashion
Chemical attraction
Ruby red lips and her eyes real low

[Chorus]
You're gonna miss her when she go, go, go
Shakin' her hips in her mothers clothes
You're gonna miss her when she go, go, go
It's just a question of the girl's affection
Now watch her as she go


[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the one I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm dreaming of a white, white, white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may your days be so very merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Narration]
So, as you can tell I'm very outgoing
And a little bit shy, but I decided that this song is just too short
It's such a beautiful Christmas song, but it's only one verse, so I added one extra one
Here it goes...

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Snowman
With the carrot nose and charcoal eyes
And oh, when he cries, I'm going to tell him it's okay
Because Santa's on his sleigh, and on his way
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
So may your days and Thanksgiving be so bright
And may all your Christmases be white



[Verse 1]
Why do you look so good in those jeans?
Why'd you come around me with an ass like that?
You're makin' all my thoughts obscene
This is not, not like me
Why you keep on texting me like that? (Damn)
Got other things I need my mind on, yeah
Other responsibilities
This is not, not like me

[Chorus]
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh

[Verse 2]
Boy could you please stop bein' so fine
When I stare at you, I wish I were blind
'Cause I begin to lose control
No I can't, can't let go

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause ever since I met you
I've been prayin' on my knees
That you would always stay around
That you would never leave
But I'm the kind of girl that always needs to be free
Why did you do that to me?

[Chorus]
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh
Why did you do that? (Do that)

[Bridge]
I can't stop talkin' 'bout what you do to me
You keep keepin' me from how I'm supposed to be
To be

[Chorus]
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me (Oh why did you do that to me?)
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that (Why?)
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

[Post-Chorus]
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh, ahh-ahhh (Why did you do that to me?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh, ahh-ahhh (Why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?




[Verse 1]
It's funny how things, they change
The clouds they part
Rearrange for me
Faces of strangers and I have no familiars to help me see

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is home?
I want you to know

[Chorus]
That I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wonder if God hides out in cities to set us free
'Cause, yeah, this room is crowded, but I am so alone in it
Help me, please

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is home?
I want you to know

[Chorus]
That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Bridge]
And I will be strong
I won't give in
I won't deny you
I know where we've been
I'm so much more than all of my fears
Than all of these tears
My tears, yeah

[Breakdown]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is home?
I want you to know
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here




[Verse 1]
If I fell in love with you, would you understand me, dear?
Love is weird
I colored you a valentine
Struggled just to stay inside the lines
I lose my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I really can't believe I lost myself again

[Chorus]
Looking for something crazy
Beautiful love
And now I'm talking in circles again
Have my love, baby
Are you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am
Wonderful, 'cause I am

[Verse 2]
I wrote a song about your eyes
Ate a slice of cherry pie
I cried all night
On a bench inside the park
I'll kiss you slowly in the dark
I'll never stop

[Pre-Chorus]
I really can't believe I lost myself again

[Chorus]
Looking for something crazy
Beautiful love
And now I'm talking in circles again
Have my love, baby
Are you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am
Wonderful, 'cause I am

[Bridge]
Baby, take me for a ride
Maybe get a little high in a place we have never been
Time is nothing but a line
We leave everything behind
It'd be so wonderful, wonderful

[Chorus]
Looking for something crazy
Beautiful love
And now I'm talking in circles again
Have my love, baby
Are you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am
Wonderful, 'cause I am

[Outro]
(Looking for something crazy)
Wonderful I am (beautiful nothing, now)
I am, I am (I'm talking in circles again)
It's killing me, boy, yeah
I am, I am
You'll know how wonderful I am
Wonderful I am
Wonderful I




[Verse 1]
I won't break down today
Another brick's in my way of shadows
The promises they made
Regret themselves, and say "this is too hard"

[Refrain]
Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me

[Pre-Chorus]
So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

[Chorus]
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone

[Verse 2]
Whenever you're afraid, or someone's far away
Never give in
'Cause happily we'll reign when consequences change
Believe you can win

[Refrain]
Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me

[Pre-Chorus]
So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

[Chorus]
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

[Chorus]
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words and be gone
Your words and be gone
I'll take your words and be gone




[Verse 1]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
No good boys ever go to heaven

[Pre-Chorus]
Bodies movin', wundaland
Open mouths kiss, and we dance
I can't believe, c-c-can't, can't believe that I met you

[Chorus]
Pink champagne
Mirror ball spinnin' 'round again
In this wundaland where I met you (talk to me, talk to me)
So DJ play

Hold your breathe count to eleven

Face down in a pillow, she cries
Her black mascara runs in circles from her-er-er eyes
Pink feather regrets she washes away
She said she wants him
But it's hurtin' and it's burnin' him the worst
The worst way

She does the yay ha
Yay, yay, yay, yay ha
Let's do the yay ha
Yay, yay, yay, yay ha

Her white skin looks better in this kind of light
Pink feather regrets she washes away
Looks in her mirror
And it's hurtin' and it's burnin' in the worst
The worst way

She does the yay ha

Then why do we play

[Intro]
We are plastic, ooh
Nous sommes plastique

[Verse 1]
Here we go, 'round on the boulevard
Top, cut that cake, till my sugar flow stop
(Yeah, it don't stop.)
Don't stop

Drip, drip, drip, baby watch me melt
T-take a sip, sip, sip, but it doesn't help me stop

Can't stop

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of the summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of the summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in a blender
Yeah, baby, we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer
Melt in the summer


[Post-Chorus]

Before the rockshow was oh-oh-over
Here we go-go, sir
We're making time, it's a record, record, record

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
There's...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(Something), something about this place
(Something), something, 'bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me "Heart of Gold"
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you


[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
"Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
There's...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(There's something), something about this place
(Something), something, 'bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy

Without you and I, I
C'mon! Put your drinks up!

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and Nebraska, and Jesus Christ
There's...


[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(Something), something, something about the chase
Six whole years
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about
Just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up, for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love ya

[Final Chorus: Lady Gaga & Brian May]
You and I
You, you and I
Baby, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
You and I
You, you and I
Nebraska, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

Li-i-i-i-berate-eh !
*sit and bit guitar*
I!
You-oh ! i !
Mother F* !

-Born this way-

I lxve you too. *plays piano*

So I heard there was a rally here a couple weeks ago
I heard that a million very right wing conservative people spoke out against gay marriage in France
F those F people
Those people do not represent the true perspective of this country. They are extremely conservative, extremely right-wing, and all that we have to do, all that you have to do is be louder than them
Because you are on the right side of history, you are on the side of love, the side of acceptance, the side of tolerance
So don't you let them bring you down, don't you let them think they're setting you back 'cause they're not, they're just a F bunch of winey b*s
I don't mean that as fighting words but, you know, it's 2014 and people are getting together

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
We're all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, la France you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way


[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital "H"im
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this friends and
Mi amore vole fe yah! yeah-ah!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes!
I'm on the right track, baby
*point mic*
Don't hide yourself
*point mic*
*plays*

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way!
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way

[Pause]
So, if you are living in France, whether you're young, or old, or in the middle, if you're gay, hold your head up high and be F proud and live your life
And if anybody here feels uncomfortable with this conversation you probably shouldn't have come to this concert. Here we spread love with every invention that we make. You don't have to feel invisible, you don't have to feel like you don't matter

[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life! *hold notes*
Your on the right track, baby
You are born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige
Paris..
We're all born superstars!
*plays*

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
(Spoken)
I'm not leaving without your vote tonight, you know that right?
(Sung)
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
(Spoken)
Come on put your hands up. Are you ready? A one, two, three

[Chorus]
Something, something about this place
(Spoken)
You love this place don't you? Come on cheer for it
(Sung)
Something, something, 'bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Pennsylvania guy
Yeah, there's something about, Joe, you and I


[Verse 2]
It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me Neil Young "Heart of Gold"
With a guitar humming and a no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you, oh, oh, oh, oh
(spoken)
And you know I put on some country clothes the other day and said I was voting for Joe 'cause I wear cabellas when I'm on a four-wheeler in Pennsylvania. And I will not be told what I can and cannot wear to endorse our future president. So this is what I have to say about that. I might not always look like you, but I am you. We are each other

[Pre-Chorus]
Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down where we belong, the whole damn country

[Chorus]
Something, something about this place
(Spoken)
The beautiful countryside
(Sung)
Something, 'bout lonely nights
And my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about my cool Pensylvania guy
(Spoken)
I'm not kidding, we need every single vote and Imma keep saying it
(Sung)
So put your hands up for Pensylvania
Pensylavania, Pensylavania, Pensylvania I love you
You and I


(Spoken)
Hands up come on!

[Post-Chorus]
You, you and I
[?]
You, you and I, I
You and I
You, you and I
Baby, baby I'd rather die
America without you and I
You and I

C'mon! Put your drinks up!

[Outro]
It's been a long time since I came around
(Spoken)
And, you know, to my boyfriend that's here tonight, I'm so sorry I had to do the whole Pennsylvania and I dated a guy here thing. I love you so much. It's true
(Sung)
It's been a long time, but I'm back in town
(Spoken)
And we're counting on you tomorrow, okay. And I know the good-hearted people here and my grandma and my whole family that's in West Virgina next door, okay I know, I know what this is. This is love
(Sung)
And this time I'm not leaving, this time I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving without
(Spoken)
America I love you, I pray for you tomorrow. Let's win this. Pensylvania go blue!
(Sung)
Without you, woah

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"

[Chorus]
(Something), something about this place
(Something), something about New York Nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool American guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Chorus]
America, America, I love you!
You and I

[Post-Chorus]
You, you, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I
You and I
You, you, you and I
America, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I


[Bridge]
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and America, and Jesus Christ
(Happy Thanksgiving)

[Chorus]
(Something), something about the chase
Six whole years
So put your drinks up, put your drinks up
For America, America, I love you

[Post-Chorus]
You, you and I
Oh yeah, well, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

[Chorus: Elizabeth Gillies]
Something, something about the chase
I'm a New York woman born to run you down

[Outro: Elizabeth Gillies]
It's been along time since I came around
Been along time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you

[Verse 1]
I know where you were last night
I saw you with your hands on her
Rubbin' her like you love her more than me
And I cannot believe
What's she got that I don't?
Know how you could pass up
A night with me to drive 'round homegirl
When I've got a body you can feel
Boy she's not even real
Don't lie to me 'cause

[Chorus]
I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car?
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car?)
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car)

[Verse 2]
You stayed home to repaint her
When I could use a hot wax, personal manicure
I need attention too
So you might have to choose
'Cause I can't take it
When I know that I'm more fine
And I got the interior love and it's genuine
My trunk is just as round
And I'll never break down
Babe, it's not fair that


[Chorus]
I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car?
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car?)
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car)
I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car?
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car?)
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car
(Your freakin' car, freakin' car)

[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions on a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

[Verse 4]
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen


[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Outro]
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
