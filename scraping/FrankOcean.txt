[Verse 1]
I ain't gettin' no younger
So boy, when I say love
I don't say it just to say love
I know better
If you never showed love
Don't think I woulda known love
Gotta put it in my song, love
And sing it over and over

[Pre-Chorus]
I told my mother that I love ya
My brother asked me where I met ya
Said I saw you last Tuesday
On the corner of 1st and Love
I heard ya, whistling my favorite song
When I saw ya that morning on the corner of 1st and Love

[Chorus]
Right there, right there, oh
And I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there, right there
On the corner of 1st and Love

[Verse 2]
My heart was beating like a bass drum
I heard Cupid in my ear
He said he never saw better
I gave him a straight shot
And it hit me like a moving truck
I howled like an animal
But it never felt so good
[Pre-Chorus]
I told my mother that I love ya
And Ray-J asked me where I met ya
Said I saw you last Tuesday
On the corner of 1st and Love
I heard ya, whistling my favorite song
When I saw ya that morning on the corner of 1st and Love

[Chorus]
Right there (Right there), right there (Right there, oh)
And I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there (Standing right there), right there
(Saw my baby right there)
On the corner of 1st and Love

[Bridge]
This ain't serendipity, no
I know that it's meant to be love
Don't feel like luck to me (Luck to me), no
Know that it had to be love

[Verse 3]
Like our names carved on a tree
The memories inside of me
Don't know how long forever is
Would you stay with me and find out with me?
Oh, if the sun don't rise for weeks
Baby, that's alright with me
I can't add to infinity
But if you stay with me, you can count on me, oh
[Chorus]
Right there (I saw him right there), right there, oh
(Saw him first and love when I saw my baby)
And I wanna sing it to the world (Oh, whoa)
He's right there (Right there), right there (Right there)
On the corner of 1st and love

[Outro]
I saw you by the street signs
Oh I, I saw you by the street signs
They read 1st and Love
Love, love, love
[Intro: Nas]
Crack fucked up the world
And I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era
Who made a lot of money off that shit
And I wonder if it fucked with they conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from

[Chorus: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Shit's getting warmer, on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother's a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you’re accustomed what you’re used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind
And it’s all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent?
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up
It's my fault
You can, blame me, motherfucker
For killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger
All I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tucked
Didn’t realize this game fucked, up some lives
Oh, how's mine?
My conscience eats it up all the time but, other than that I’m fine
I got a little money in my pocket
[Chorus: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop, I stole that truck
And I sold that dope, motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I'm sorry (Yeah)
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I’m sorry (Yeah, nigga)
Could have been an actor and won that Oscar, said I'm sorry
I sold that soul, and I killed black folk, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my mama all cool, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
I'm in too deep and I can’t see the shore, I'm sorry

[Outro: Nas & Tyler, The Creator]
You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip (I'm sorry)
The, the, the, the transaction, the hustling (I'm sorry)
Even more than the money, it's just your job (I'm sorry)
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person (I'm sorry)
And to do this and do that
You become the go to guy, you know, forever
Next thing you know you’re in too deep
Way too deep, it'll scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man
You know, dudes is buying choppers
Shoot down the people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other
Nobody wins, ya know what I mean?

Swag, swag times two

I don't cry cause I'm strong
I don't cry cause nothing lasts forever
I don't cry cause the kids are grown
I don't cry at all
I don't cry cause them days are gone
Ooh child, ooh child

But when the sun sets, just right, ooh I might
Shed a tear
And when the good word hits home
I'll shed a tear
I'll shed two tears

I won't cry in the car
I won't cry in the bathroom stall
I won't cry when I'm home alone
I won't cry at all
I won't cry cause them days are gone
Ooh child, ooh baby doll

But if the sun shines too beautiful, I might
I'll shed two tears
And when the good word hits home
I'll shed two more tears

Now that's four tears - you got enough?
No more tears, you've had enough
That's four tears

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold-out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

[Bridge: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator]

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...

[Part II: Mr. Lonely]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Lionel & Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

[Outro: Jasper]
Ohh! Damn! Damn!

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the reason we don't get down
So I'ma let you do the leading and follow you now
See, I just don't usually do this
But you're bringing me out
All the doubts I had have gone away
When you're touching me I'm not afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Knowing this ain't going away, here to stay
I just wanna be your girl
I can be all you want, will you stay?
I just wanna be your girl
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra
Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra
[Verse 2]
I didn't even see you coming
It was such a surprise
I wasn't expecting nothing
Now I'm lit up inside
Your bringing out all the colours
No more black and white
You won the race and got the gold
So here I am, we're good to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Knowing this ain't going away, here to stay
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/claude-kelly/-/abracadabra.html]
I just wanna be your girl
I can be all you want, will you stay?
I just wanna be your girl
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you got my heart on lock

[Bridge]
I don't wanna take my time
I don't wanna wait in line
I just want you by my side
Come and gimme what I like
I don't wanna take my time
I don't wanna wait in line, no

'Cause you are beautiful and you are young
You deserve to have the best in life
In a certain way

[Verse 1]
She singing, "Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say"
I'm like, who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C
Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me?"
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
[Verse 2]
You said, "One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode"
Well, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me?
Don't you know you're my baby?
Don't you know you're my baby, ooh?
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

[Outro]
You'll live a better life
(A better life, young one, a better life, young one)
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speed, who cares what car you're driving?
No Benz can make you friends
She don't care what car I'm driving
And no Bentley can kiss me back
This song is dedicated to my '91 Acura
My 1991

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Yup, duplex in New Orleans east
I was writin' down everything
Things I would tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleepin' on my back, my body would wake up after me
My barber fresh out the penitentiary
That alcohol was stingin' me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
One was in the shower
My aunt in law come over to fuss and fight
So she get out in cutoffs and a wifebeater
Barefeet and bra-less, titties swingin'
She was seventeen then
Vaseline and Reebok classics
Weaves and baskets
Take the bully on the greenest grasses
His name was Renny, we was cool after
Matthew had some pairs of Air Maxes
Clarky had them road rashes
Lost the virgin on a air mattress
Texturizer, feelin' unnatural
This what I would do just to show you
That it's special now

[Outro: Frank Ocean, Sampha & Jazmine Sullivan]
What could I do to know you better than I do now?
What can I do to love you more than I do now?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do to show my love?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do? What can I do?



Verse 1:
I remember looking up
Almost choked and dropped my cup
There you were, style and grace
Glowing smile on your face

Beautiful inside and out, you
Helped me more, than i can count
I was all alone inside, you
Took me by the hand and cried

Post-Chorus:
"I fucking love you"
And, i know i did too

Verse 2:
But my emotions were so far away
My feelings trapped inside
Bottled up, always toxic
Always cowered, never showed it

Post-chorus:
Fuck my lame ass superstitious
Fuck my crippling inhibitions
Fuck my numbness, im searching for
The word

Chours:
Buried under there
Trying not to stare
Others don't compare
Are you even real?

And i know it's true
All i want is you
You you you you

Verse 3:
Im fine with all the broken pieces that thrown away from me
Im fine with all the broken memories that i got to keep it with me
Im fine that i need to stay away from you because i just want you happy
Im fine but i really needed you with me

Chours:
And i know it's true
All i want is you
You you you you
You



[Intro]
Peons got my blood boiling
Leave me be, I don't wanna talk to ya
In my business, knock it off, I ain't on you
You're in my way, now back off from me

[Verse 1]
Sleep with the sun out, I'm up with the moon
Workin' on music, I been makin' moves
They said the summer 'gone be like a movie
I say "How sway?" it ain't nothin' to do
Bein' productive, I can't touch a doobie
Puttin' in work, I got somethin' to lose
Leave all the fake shit not talking Adobe
We know that you ain't 'gone pull up and shoot

[Bridge]
(Shit I'll work out on my own
Shit I'll work out on my own
Shit I'll work out on my own-oh)
Sleep with the sun out, I'm up with the moon
(Know I gotta focus, Time is)
They said the summer 'gone be like a movie
(Gotta lock into- gotta lock in)
Puttin' in work, I got somethin' to lose
(Gotta catch some time alone-oh)
We know that you ain't 'gone pull up and shoot
(Yeah, oh-oh)

[Verse 2/Outro]
Bleach and dye, now I'm purple
Hit me up, I just come come and go
No De'Sean, runnin' outta time
Gotta focus, 'fore I'm outta line
Drop a dime, tryna reach me
I'm away, so leave a message
On a trip, can't get me
Psychadelic, DMT
(Time running low
I got to get shit together)

Glory
It's a sweet world
Always
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Always
It's a sweet world
It's so easy
And I'm not afraid
And I have no hurt
Always
She just walks the land
Grounds to an old war
And I'm acting like I'm never sure that it's...

It's a sweet world
May I have her hand?
I won't protect myself
If I find her close, I'll keep her
Always

We're nothing left and uneven
We're nothing left and uneven
We're nothing left and uneven

We're nothing left and uneven
We're nothing left and uneven
This is how I wanna feel
It's so easy
Not disappearing
I'm no guardian
But if we're here again
I'll be on your side
Of the glass
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Always

It's a sweet world
But who's housing it?
I can unstick these things
And I'll be glad to see them leave forever
And always
And I'll just walk the land
Grounds to an old war
And I'll be acting so sure
It's a sweet world

This is how I wanna feel
Always

It's a sweet world

A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Always2017, bruh

I promise you, bruh

You're listening to blonde

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
American love
American me
American you
American tears
American heartbreak
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I took a walk with the palm trees
As the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you (You)
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
M-R-S dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen (Oh)
In the fancy, fancy cursive (Oh)
Then turned her term papers in (Oh, oh)
A thesis on Islamic (Oh)
Virgin brides and arranged marriage (Ah, ah)
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know (Oh)
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far" (Oh)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
Well, you can have my Mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Oh, if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later, anyway
It's love made in the USA

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Don't let 'em front you, they sayin' you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be trippin' over some bitch-ass, dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You could get sensitive, but this shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
And nigga, if I did it, I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do

Bitches think I'm crazy, but I'm normal
I just come off as a psycho maniac when I'm performin'
That's an act so I won't bore you to death, 'cause I adore you
And it's the summer, so (Yeah)

So go ahead, take a dip
The water's pretty deep

Oh, girl you blow my mind everytime that we're alone
Girl, let's do something new, baby tell me where you wanna go
So much opportunity, so many possibilities
I know when we be sexing cause you'll never know where we be sexing girl
I can't wait til you get off so I can put it on you
I've been thinking about you all day
You got that kind of love make a nigga wanna spend it on you
She ain't like them other girls, she ain't like them other girls
We be all up on the couch, we be all up on my dresser
We be all up in my bad, lil shorty ain't scared
We just do it anywhere..
In the backseat of my car, I know she don't mind
All up in your office, putting in that overtime
We just do it anywhere..Click pic for annotation[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I said niggas be takin' life too serious
I swear my music take lives - uh, period
Mellowhype, things are dependent-free mind-pyramids
Breaking walls down, never a Black Hawk Down, oh
They put a label on me but I see they’re all clowns
That’s why I talk English and think fast
Feel my words through the ink's last letter
Which'll never turn his back, back catcher, I grab
Extra magazines I'm in, to remind me of the places I’ve been
Returning to visit again, me and my fuckin’ friends
Before I hit the stage I clench my microphone until my fist hurt
Before I eat sushi, I’d rather get to know the fish first
For all the cats behind my time, that rhyme - that shit's worth
Everything in my mental state now I’m secure, mental ways
Dental plates in my jaw for spitting raw just because
I like to floss my talent

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Think I'm-a wear the yellow tux at the Grammy's
And rock out with my cock out...
Like "who this kid think he is?"
It’s just something I've seen Prince do
It’s true...
No matter what, I'm showing up
Who gives a flying floating fuck
What people say, or think?
Cause end of the day, start of the day they all said we wouldn’t get here anyway
You blink, and Wolf Gang’s in this bitch...
[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
When I was a kid I wanted to be just like you
(When I grew up, when I, when I, grew up)
Write my own rhymes, recite 'em a couple times
Hoping one day it blew up so me and my niggas could shine
I got 3 quarters and about 10 dimes
You can split them 10’s up cause both these quarters are mine
Let’s fuckin' celebrate, Wolf Gang confederate
We made it, we made it, we made it and you hatin'
Cause we made it and we made it
And that is not an understatement (oh!)
I put that on the people that I stay with
Live day to day with, tour bus is the slave ship
Niggas worked the grave shift, record clean up and play disc
We must be misbehaving
But the fans love it, they get the subject
Niggas claim be rappers but don’t fulfil the substance
Fuckin rubbish, I'll dust quick
Nothing to fuck with, I've got my hands on my balls, like my nuts itch

I remember I first played Trick some OF shit
And he fronted on it like.. nah that shit will never work
Ha ha ha, like word?
Family: these 2 wrists of mine
I had to make them gold
You gotta let me shine...
If you’re a friend of mine
Ask any friend of mine
I’ll never block your glow, won’t curb your high
We be, in a place they never been
Hellabands, for the hell of it
In Paris Paris Paris
White wings on desert sand
Flyin' over the Taliban... Probably
We be in a place they never been

My aunt asked my moms if she won the lotto, where would she choose to live in the world. my moms said los angeles..my aunt asked me next.. i said africa. I didn’t think about it a whole lot, it was just the first thing that came to mind. I’ve never been to africa but i know it’s a big place.. so my answer wasn’t really specific. It probably wasn’t even honest. I don’t know. I’m starting to think america’s fucked. I actually started thinking that a while ago. I sense a lot of young americans feel this way too, there’s good reason. honestly, i just live here. i’m an american, sure, but it’s not really a choice i made for myself. if you gave me a map i could show you worse places to be born and better. but i was born here, i live here and it’s chill here. so maybe if i hit the lotto, i’d stay in los angeles too.. pay the taxes and buy mom a house out here

Granted, i’ll probably revise this after i see the world. but what if i don’t?

[Verse 1]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

[Chorus]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Verse 2]
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about
[Chorus]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Bridge]
(Wait, waiting)
Let me know
You niggas goin' in
Tell me what it is (Fuck it)
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find, find a place for me

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, know
Love

[Outro]
Stay at your best baby
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1]
I was 16 when we first laid eyes
Scrawny little fucker, yeah, I was that guy
And you was down for the weekend
I was down for the greetings
And you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck
But it was my first official date so I was stuck, like
It was past curfew, and we was at the Grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something
All I remember was your motherfucking face

[Hook]
I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag

[Verse 2]
You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I’m holding your hand and
Making eye contact I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses
I’m insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it
Cause holding your fingertips is golden
I fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and
Grip and keep holding on girl
[Hook]
As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag

[Verse 3]
You got a nigga... Wait
Don't think this is going to work
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
I haven’t talked to you in a couple of days
I got too comfortable
And started to think that we was really a couple
But hey, (fuck you) at least there was time spent
But by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant
But when you realize, its awkward, your name still my password
So I’m always fucking reminded
You got a nigga sprung

[Outro]
You're my girlfriend... You're my girl (Whether you like it or not!)
You're my girl... You're my girlfriend, you're my girl girlfriend (You know I like you a lot!)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl (Shit, I know that you not)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend
You're my girl.. oooo
You're my, you're my Girl
Ooooo girlfriend... girlfriend..
You're my girlfriend you're my girl girlfriend you're my girl
You're my girlfriend

The love glows, I know the love glows
Oh I know the love glows, I know the love glows
Yeah

[Verse 1]
If we colored our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bare hands
We can make light out of thin air
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well
Dreams feel realer than right now
But whatever you do don’t let go
My only nightmare is waking up alone
In a world where you’re not mine
And the room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That’s why I never sleep with my back to you

[Chorus]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you
[Verse 2]
Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of the bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart and your pillows
Whatever you do just don’t go
Baby, the worst jail is
Waking up alone in a world where you’re not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I’m looking in you eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you

[Chorus]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Bridge]
Like a nightlight
Like a teddy bear
Like a toddler’s blanket
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children
Ooooooo, yeah
[Chorus]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

Back packing your bags
Taking back jackets and giving back keys to your heart (uh)
Back tracking the past
Baby, it's bad, I can't take it back

[Pre-Chorus]
Aw baby I tried
I tried but I can't stop time
I tried but I won't rewind

So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?

[Chorus]
He said "Allahu akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion, ooh
This unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me

Love me, love

[Verse 1]
My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing way too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out

[Pre-Hook]
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

[Hook 1]
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

[Verse 2]
I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left
I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again

[Pre-Hook]
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

[Hook 2]
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

[Verse 1]
My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing way too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out

[Pre-Hook]
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

[Hook 1]
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

[Verse 2]
I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left
I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back bеfore the sun comes up again

[Pre-Hook]
Causе my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count
[Hook 1]
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 1- Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, Soon as I enter
I put a hurting on it
If I don’t kill it she injured
For a Long time
Summer, spring and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some 87' Locs
She’s seen them hundred spokes
And then that woman spoke
But I don’t talk back, I put my life on tracks
If that don’t work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax
It must be you, cuz I burn right through
Everything ya’ll do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar AKA “The Cash King"
Quicker than pre-cum won’t you give her a reason;
To not meet up with me like a vegan
Psssst! God-Damn I’m the fuckin man
She said fuck her man
Now she fuck with Mann
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 2- Mann]
Everytime I close my eyes I see a different dream
I pray to God that we don’t close until we reach our dreams
College tuition for daughters and I ain’t even father
Now I got a rebel at the altar call me prince or king
Six digits for me like we did to offer
I used to call me Waldo, and now they call me Walter
Yeah, I hide in them uckle pants, living without a purpose, man
But that just got my circumstances
And I mean it, if you want it, come and get it, boy
Death come in threes and you’re looking like triplets boys
In high school I climbed the roof so I could smoke my weed
The dealers knew that I was young and sold me bag of seeds
I’m chasing dreams, hoes chasing me
But I just gave the name and number like the maitre D
‘cause all I wanna do was roll up hash and smash the ass of a bitch who lived like Kim Kardashian
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom

Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 3- Mann]
She is the last straw, I’ve bend her and slip slow
My pencil draws her closer, she gets high and bends low
Long flight from my Cali mistress, to a district with red lights
Prostitutes and rich niggas, just a recipe for long nights
Shake well and all they do, I’m laying next to some girl who last night showed me things I never knew
Either I’m bending space out or I’m just bending space in
I put my heart on tracks, but it’s four AM and that chick’s still racing
One bed, two girls, three way, four times
My shame came off their clothes, it’s paradise of the mind
Absolute vodka mixed with absolute freedom
I meet my darker side and it’s a pleasure just to meet him
I’m thinking about puffing and writing while fucking
Yesterday’s gone and tomorrow ain’t come
And if tomorrow ain’t come and that’s the name that she told me
But when you hit this level, every first name is phoneme
But here, the air tastes better, weed is more potent and girls seem wetter
Days are a haze and drinks just stronger, nocturnal nigga, these nights seem longer
I’m only here for one night, it’s Disneyland for man, white girls, blue kush, red lights
America and Amster…damn

They'd try to develop an alternate ending for the tale

[Skit: Rosie Watson]
Many college students have gone to college
And gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else
Don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana
Because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye

[Verse 1]
Gotta believe in me (Gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down
Like a seesaw let you down
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger

But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger, you bigger, woah

[Verse 2]
Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't pushovers, no more, baby

Remember those stone washed jeans (I remember that)
Don't knock your earrings (Like yesterday)
They shined on me (We were little then)
In class daydreaming of you (My babe, wow, just a little love getting bigger)
You, wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
I think, it's gone out of control

I was a player when I was little (Just a little bigger, hahaha)
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger

The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own

Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'… got…

[Verse 2]
Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo
Maybe the four wheel excitin' us mo'
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads (obstacles)
I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod
Savage is bikin', yeah

[Verse 3]
Transition lightning (ascending)
Ashes and remnants of ballers
Body that's gutted
A Bentley that used to be flawless
I'm high up, the raindrops keep falling
Scattered, the showers
Don't scaffold the towers
I'm up, mom, I promise
In class with the honors
No cheat like I'm honest
And how did I become so accomplished?
'cause I don't see foes
I just see a code
I just see a hole
Chinks in your armor
Like Pac in the Hummer
Like Jigga in summer
Left the house like Obama
Hit the road like a runner
Hit the road like Road Runner
I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking

[Chorus]
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin' with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'

[Outro]
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike

[Skit: Woman and Frank Ocean]
Stop! Stop! Stooooop! Let me do it!
(Fine)
No you always play what you want to play. I want to play
You don't got no Jodeci or something?
All you bitches want is Jodeci, what the fuck?
What is a Radiohead anyway?
Whatever

- Stop! Let me go! You don't got no Jodeci?
- All you bitches want is Jodeci, what the fuck?
- What's a Radiohead.. anyway
- Whatever..



BITCH I THINK I’M TOM PETTY



Ramadan clean plates on that bronze chevy

Finna paint that gold flake on my bond girl



[Verse 1]
She’s the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen on a skateboard
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos
She’s thinking maybe the next one should have something to do with me, to do with me

[Pre-Hook]
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

[Verse 2]
Said you should get a rubix cube over your heart
But you say I’ve already figured it out
Already figured out the love
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip
Cause that’s what she feel like she on when we on each other
Loving on each other, kissing on each other

[Pre-Hook]
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

[Bridge]
Paper to pen, needle to skin
I'm in the chair
And she’s over there
Taking these pictures
And blowing me kisses
When I asked her to hold my hand
She told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
She told me that, told me that

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

Frank: Yeah.

Jay-Z: I just don't know...

Frank: Yeah, yeah.

Jay-Z:Take radio for instance. It's pretty much an advertisement model. You take these pop stations, they're reaching 18-34 young white females. So they're playing music based on those tastes. And then they're taking those numbers and they're going to advertising agencies and people are paying numbers based on the audience that they have. So these places are not even based on music. Their playlist isn't based on music. If you think a person like Bob Marley right now probably wouldn't play on a pop station. Which is crazy. It's not even about the DJ discovering what music is best. You know, music is music. The line's just been separated so much that we're lost at this point in time. They have to revolutionize that thing, you know, be more progressive. I think with all the technology and where we are today, it's definitely a more efficient way to get music out.

Because it's the whole idea behind having a festival that played all sorts of music. Because no one listens to music like that - you just listen to music more than ever. Back in the days there used to be hip-hop clubs. Like, specific hip-hop clubs. Now every club is a hip-hop club. Every club is a music club. You go in there, you're liable to hear EDM, hip-hop, you're gonna hear some soul, you’re definitely going to hear "Poison" around 2-3 in the morning.

It's unfortunate because with, you know, technology and everything moving forward, we should, it should be a better way that the music, the musicians, radio, and these things that are supposed to be instruments for the arts, should exist. And it shouldn’t be about advertisement. And it shouldn't be about—so the more times, you know, someone like yourself can bypass that, it’s better for the, for the arts. And it's better for the audience 'cause you have to have, like, a level of discipline and just a belief to put music out in this place where not everyone can.

Frank: Right.

Jay-Z: You know, people, like, they wanna shoot for that, and then they're making music that's not really conditioned who they are so they can reach a certain platform.


I had the time of my life making all of this
Thank you all
Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish
Which is basically everyone of y'all
Haha. Love you



[Verse 1]
Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My soul glow with the low cut, no jheri curl, Jerry Rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, won't think twice
Your little baby bone boy killin' me
Swearing he's grown when he got that steel
But he ain't swam with that blue whale
I ain't swam with that ho neither, Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water, hope the monster don't wag his tail
And send that big wave over while I'm showin' off my pirate grill
To the baddies walkin' by me, showin' skin because it's nothing
My little brother servin' molly 'cause that bill due Monday
And my passport's buried and my home town flooded
With just a little bit of water, but my shoes still muddy
And if I ever have a daughter, I wonder what I could call her?
Nine months after I fuck on the beach, I guess I call her Karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat, I'm kiddin' but I'm ballin'
Just playin' but I'm serious, I'm witted and I'm wildin'

[Chorus]
This life goes on, man, that's one thing about it
This life goes on, dawg, that's one thing about it
I'm feelin' what you're sayin', you're tryin' to get around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it

[Verse 2]
Stuck in the sky, first time upside down on the whole ride
And I wasn't much into the type that my bros like
So I never really had no wife and that's alright
"Black woman ain't got no man," that's what she said to me
Yeah she did, that you can date outside your race, I mean
I ain't supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case, I mean
Somebody please switch my plates, ship my car to Rome
5k on the wheels, still ain't ridin' chrome
Backpack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal
So let irrelevant nigga do what irrelevant nigga feel
Let a regular nigga judge
Because his gavel fake and he regular, still
How that gravel taste? How you paid your medical bill?
Sands white on my tan feet, Colosseum in the back seat
Straw hut where the beach be
Like screen saver when your Mac sleep
Relaxing, I ain't racin' no fuckin' rats, I'm relaxing
And if it's wrong to ya

[Chorus]
Well, life goes on, brother, that's one thing about it
Life goes on, my nigga, one thing about it
I'm sayin' what you're seein', we tryin' to talk around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it

My boyfriend drives a lil bucket
When it rain it fills up with rain
My boyfriend he gon pick me up
Don't distract him at the wheel
In his lane
He's the only one

My boyfriend he misses me when I'm gone
So he don't forget me
There's a song he sings
Calms his nerve, endings
My boyfriend is friendly
And we don't want no problems

I could say that I'm happy
They let me and my boyfriend become married
I could say that I'm happy
But cross my heart I didn't notice
Hope to die no never, we voted
Me and my boyfriend cast our ballot
Every kiss reads like a poem
Making wrongs right like a poem

I couldn't say I dream of you
Because my dreams are filled with no one
And all is lost
Me and my boyfriend we found
We don't hope for beyonds at all
Me and my boyfriend spend time
And that's all I'm holding on
This time
We got permission
Nothing's above condition
But this ain't a thang
It's a mission

Can't join the band so sing along
Me and my boyfriend got it going on
Sleep with fans and t shirts on
Asleep in vans your legs all strewn
Across my lap
Tan lines where your watch was strapped
You took off to make time

Cut your hair
You left it so long
I love to stare
There's nothing wrong
And if I die while I'm asleep
I pray to God my boyfriend
Keeps my secret

This is dedicated to my Aunt Janet, my grandfather Lionel and Mathew Lacey
[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face, yeah
Large crystals hang from your ears
Are they here
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind
Maybe I'm a fool
And maybe I should move
To settle, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
So what would you recommend I do?
I'm living in the city, yes
Forgetting there's a jungle outside
Nah
I'm living in an ideal
An idea from another man's mind (Mind)
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind
I'd rather go to jail
I'd rather try hell
Or I could be a fool
And settle, for a place with a nice view (nice view, nice view)
(For a place with a nice view)
[Hook]
I would do anything for you
Yes, I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I'd do anything for you....
(Anything, anything)

I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you
For you
For you

[Verse]
Still ain't have my float trip down your spine in so long, uh
Learning on the bitch, woo, get it
Search of the clique, woo, get it
Standing in the rave, woo, get it
Raise the flag and wave, woo

[Bridge]
Read something deep kill the pressure with the light
What I'm made of

[Verse 1]
If a tree fell in the forest
And no one was around to hear it
Baby, does it go boom?
Does it go boom?
If I have love for ya
But you were never close enough to feel it
Is my love any good?
Is my love any good?
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But the distance ain’t even a room away
You’re laying in the bed right next to me
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulder
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

[Chorus]
How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel
[Verse 2]
I know you’re somewhere in there
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiseling away, away
Chiseling away, away
Girl my phone bill is crazy
The rate is sky high when I call ya
But you only let it ring
You only let it ring, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But the distance ain't even a room away
You’re laying in the bed right next to me
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

[Chorus]
And how do I stay in love with your rubbish
Shorty leftovers in garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel
[Bridge]
Stomp, stomp
I think I hear ‘em coming down the hall
He don’t hear a word I say at all
I’m wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk
Oh, stomp, stomp
I think I hear ‘em coming down the hall and
He don’t hear a word I said, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

[Chorus]
How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

[Verse 1]
Reminiscing on a younger love
Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus
Daddy told you that I was dangerous
But I couldn't stop hustling, even if he asked me
Fast forward now we're grown-ups
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush
Our future could've been different
But lets just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me
But you knew me well, you knew I had a love on a different scale
Heavy as the heavens, you could tell
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still
It takes a strong young man to survive out here
Carrying the pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
Used to have a backpack full of that work
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt
And the broken pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
It's getting heavier

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Young man, brotha brotha, you gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', gotta understand, gotta make the plays
Stick to it, get through, write yours, ride your wave, just keep it true
We'll fight the blues, we'll fight the blues
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha man, brotha man
You gotta fight for somethin', stand for somethin'
That's what the poem told me
It was a greater poet like you know it but
I'd rather talk about how my neck is frozen and I
I'd write a song about the banging hoes and then
Stay up in the bitches while she dozing

[Chorus: French Montana]
When I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"
Now we hop out the PJs posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', "Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (Come back) come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back) babe"

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & Snoop Dogg]
Harlem nights, quick speed, Godspeed
Speed of light, Grease Lightnin', leather on my six-speed bike
Bicycle tires, icicle diamonds, popsicle stripes
Pop (Sicles) pop (Sicles) for the Klondikes
Pop-pop wheelies on the dirty bikes, 15 sellin' China white
Cops stoppin' if you opposite of white
Pop, pop like you opposite of right
Take heed, lil' nigga, lowkey, take lead on them niggas
[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Frank Ocean]
Smooth dude riding 'round the boulevard
Back in the days was on the train
Ride the bus before I ride another nigga wave
Beautiful, the water's flat like asses pre-Onika (Yeah)
You the smaller version, you the baby sneaker

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Flacko, I wonder how it feel to live or be like you
Album number three and keep it G like Q
Heard you niggas get fly like G, like 2
Nah, more like 4, like 3, not 2
Shittin' on these niggas like P, like U
Drip Raheem and Q, got Hi-C like juice
Mama hubby got life, he got three strikes too
Real niggas bleed like me, like you
That's why I got a beam with a green light too
I don't even make a scene, I just swing right through
I'm just stayin' on my Qs and my Ps like soup
Walkin' in my shoes, follow me like suit

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha-brotha, gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', brotha understand, God don't make the plays
Take the truth, get through, ride your wave, just keep the truth
[Chorus: French Montana & Frank Ocean]
Remember when I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"
Now we hop out the PJs, posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', "Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (Come back) come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back) babe"

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
You're a cornstar, all you fuck is corn broads (You fucking pop)
Frenchie faux pas 'cause you ain't had no pa
Your deal got catches like an outfielder
(Are you, are you, are you?)
Getting that God's view from towers
Lookin' downward like I'm Donald Trump

[Intro]
Why do I love you, why do you do love me, we both distant from each other, but you stuck by me
Sugar sugar town, baby come around to my place, we need to work this out in about like... 10 minutes went to waste
Yeah yeah yeah

I'll be your boyfriend, In your wet dreams tonight
Got no self control, got no self control yeah
Looked inside the page where you left at, looking at the plate where we last went
Locations, locations , yeah yeah, locations locations

[Verse 1]
Sugar sugar town yeah yeah, baby come around yeah yeah
All I hear I sounds yeah yeah, coming from your mouth yeah yeah yeah

I thought we had some fun on a Saturday
Fuck up all my funds then you ran away
Couple thousand doves wouldn’t save us
Couple thousands hundreds wouldn’t pay us

You don’t know bout me, I swear, aye
White dress on your figure looking bright, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Drop down on the side yeah, baby wanna ride yeah
I got no self control, (yeah yeah yeah yeah) I got no self control (x2)

[verse 2]
I got no self control,￼ what is your antidote, look at myself alone
I got nowhere to go, I’m going circles and I’ve just reflect the most
I do not Text the most, you call me late, short replies or ghost
I cannot fit in your page, chapter too long I’m afraid to take up the most, (yeah yeah)

Life is just like a muzzle flash, hit you hard and it go too fast
Rumors spreading like who told you that? fuck the world man those the best, quotes, so depended on your soul and then
Coldest heart I cannot sew it back, (yeah yeah)

[bridge]
I came to visit, cause you see me like a UFO, (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Drop down on the side yeah, baby wanna ride yeah
I got no self control, (yeah yeah yeah yeah) I got no self control (x2)

[outro]
Sugartown sugartown, fuck man, this shit too crazy for me I swear to god man like, shit can we go somewhere else
This shit almost feel like a movie or something like
Where even is the sweetness of this location like cmon dawg

Oh-oh
Female weather girl

In front of the camera
Morning and night
Letting me know when it pours or drizzle light
My confidence in you has reached its peak
One day will last me through the peak

I know you're such....[Verse 1]
Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down
There's a couple things we need to talk about
Like when you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't goin' your way?
Can we talk about it without the shouting?

[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again

[Hook]
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause It won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, can't be the last time

[Verse 2]
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
For forgetting every little anniversary
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Got no way to explain it, but I know we can make it
[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, I don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again

[Hook]

But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, can't be the last time

[Bridge]
Girl, I love the things you do
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you
Like when you walk out the door, when your clothes hit the floor
You were just about to break up, and now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah)
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh woah
Girl just say yeah
Oh oh oh oh, let's make up, oh

[Hook]
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?

I got a gate with my face in it

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Brand new, brand new, this new place I got to
New world, new sky that's so blue it's black too
New growth, new growth, all these fades I outgrew
Blue bands, blue bands, get my cash from drive-thru
Boy, you too flash, too flash, keep the flash minimal
Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold, see my breath visible

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah
Icy cold, it is so, it is so icy cold, yeah
Mixing the water with cheese is making the money get mold, yeah
Trying to be like gang, you better go get it in Vogue, yeah
Put '84s on lanes, I ride by, you think it is spokes ('Pokes), uh
We did it, we said it, we spoke ('Poke), yeah
We put it out, thought it was smoke, this 504, uh
This is at home, right down the street, from Alamo

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean & Travis Scott]
Moving in silence don't mean it's movin' slow
Even though the speed got old
Sprinkling methamphetamines on the leaves like the snow
Bet they soak
I'm a new species, tail swings on the road
Come to reach and lose both
Got springs like a toad
Some for free in the tote
Saké drown like round white diamonds, carats (Yah)
Copy sound, might got two wings, parrot (Alright)
Landing downwind, caught two wings (It's lit)
Talons scrape, hit the stage, two wings (Yah, yeah)
Better pray, better pray, two wings (Straight up)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Brand new, brand new, this new place I got to
New world, new sky that's so blue it's black too
New growth, new growth, all these fades I outgrew
Blue bands, blue bands, get my cash from drive-thru
Boy, you're too flash, too flash, keep the flash minimal
Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold, see my breath visible

[Bridge: JAY-Z]
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Nigga with that Lisa, uh
Talkin' about that Lisa, nigga, with that Westside, nigga
With that Eastside, that dance, uh

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly
Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot
You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
'Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep
[Chorus: Frank Ocean & JAY-Z]
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem (Uh-huh, yeah)
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare (Yeah)
In my dreams, in my dreams (Ugh)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I sat down with Prince, eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy had "Slave" on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't "big bro" me, don't "Big Homie"
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams

[Post-Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I've been out of touch for a couple years
I've been ready for this for real
Hopin' I can touch what I see
'Cause I've been ready for you, for real

[Break]
Look, you've done enough
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?

[Verse 1]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Woah)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin' (Fightin')
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Pow)
Clips on clips like Mikey (Hello)
It's really all

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

[Outro]
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown

Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home

It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel
[Outro]
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the "I Am" (Whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016, burnt some discs
2017, ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult not a clique, on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "Issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting (Fighting')
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Yeah)
Clips on clips like Mike
It's really all
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards (I mean my baby bi)
Amazing the cash online unknown (I mean my baby bi)
Blazing the dash counting money at home
My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7

[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Our lives are factual and actual
Plus you natural and match well
Burdens on my back look like a shell
Purple act, I'm moving like a snail
Both sides even like equal
Both eyes gleaning like a scale
Green and blue, hundreds turning teal
Green and blue, money colored tales
Was such a good guy to Chanel
'Til she caught me sleeping with Charel
The Range, Royce, ring, like Pharrell
Bling so she see that I'm for real
Picture me, a fire burn in Hell
Photography like David LaChapelle
Black lapels and nappy ponytail
Make 'em call me Flacko Lagerfeld

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

Swimming laps through pool water

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you

[Outro: Stevie Wonder]
Just like mine, they long to be close to you[Verse]
If I'm honest, I wasn’t devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we’re getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
(Just like mine, versions of these belong to you)
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
(Just like me)
They long to be close to you

[Part I: Close To You]

I’ll be honest
I wasn’t devastated
But you could’ve
Held my hands through it baby
Let my mind
Run underneath warms jets, jet-jets

I run my hands through what’s left
But we’re getting older baby
Don’t have much longer baby

Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
But just like mine
Versions of these belong to you
And after a while
They're keeping me close to you

[Part II:  Never Can Say]

And that is why
I never can say goodbye, oh no no I
Never can say goodbye
Even though the pain and heartache seems to
Follow me wherever I go
Try to hide the feelings but they
Always seem to show
You say "Turn around you fool
You know I love you more and more"
Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye, no no no no no I
Never can say goodbye, ooh yeah yes
I never can say goodbye, no no no
I never can say goodbye, no
No no no no no
Never can, never, never can say, nev-nev-never can say
Never can say goodbye
No

I’m not so lyrical
Or memorable
Here’s half a soul for half a soul

I’m intangible
Ethereal
Once seen
I’m an animal
And I’m caught in chains

I keep running around
Keep running round
Running round
Round round round round round, err
(Beep)

I’ve never been lyrical
Or memorable
Here’s a half a soul for half a soul

I’m redactable
Expendable
Never been in the sun before
On a cold summers day
A cold summers day

The trees are lighting up
Down in Southern California
I can’t seem to ignore them
And I’ll never feel the change
But I can feel this chain
(Yeah, oh my gosh)

Im not so lyrical, ethereal
Here’s half a soul for half a soul
In Southern California
Just thought I’d warn ya
I’ve never been outside before
On a cold summers day

I’m intangible
Alloyed gold
And once seen
I am an animal
And I sit through these long summer days
The shimmer is all just a haze (bring it down now)
(Bleep, beep)

Up here im cold, Memorable
Here’s half my soul for half your soul

I’m ethereal
Alloyed gold
And I’m an animal
Never been told
On these cold summer days

Summer in the rays
On these cold summer days
Summer in the sunrays
Summer in the rays
On these cold summer days
Summer in the sunrays
Cold summer days

In the studio we adhere to a strict color code. Developed over decades, our color code consists of a finite and precise color palate. The color code is non-negotionable. We do not stray from the color code. The whole world as we experience it visually comes to us through the mystic realm of color.

Green.
In the studio, green is olive drab. OD 7 is our olive drab.

For OD 7, our preferred choice is Kyron Industrial Camouflage 8143 Olive Drab. Hove this has been discontinued.

The search continues.

Yellow.
McDonald's Yellow - Golden #1130-6 Series 7
Kodak Yellow - Golden #1147-6, Series 6

Red.
Impervex Latex Enamel High Gloss - Brillaint Red 309

White.
Flat Finish Acabado Liso Sin Brilo Decorators White N215 04

Alternatively: native whites i.e. 1989 Chevrolet Police Package White or Hunt Foamcore White. Chevrolet Caprice, Balaenoptera musculus,  "Tom Sachs", Fondazione Prada  Milan, Italy, 6 April -15 June 2006

Black.
Flat: Black N215 90 Flat Acrylic
Gloss: Black 30980

Orange.
Orange is a native color in the studio.
You will not find orange paint here.
Except for emergency situations.
Purple.
The color puple is a forbidden color. The color purple is forbidden in the studio. The color purple is punishable by death. There is never an excuse for the color purple.

Blue.
For all NASA meatball applications we use:
Benjamin Moore Imperevex Latex High Gloss Metal and Wood Enamel  Classic Navy 309 35.

Pantone color standards are generally avoided because their limited range discourages subtlety. While we admire Pantone’s packaging and judicious use of Helvetica, we resent choosing from their limited offerings. Secret societies conspire to keep us in the dark ages of color. Comitee mentally guarantees that shitty cars like Saturn are only available in teal and maroon.
In this studio, we shun decision by committee. Instead, we look to the superlative Porshe palate, which rains beautiful despite the company's Nazi heritage and douche bag clientele.

Chorus:
Sittin' here in this orange room
Really trying not to feel green
Cuz if I end up turning blue
Imma fuck up this whole thing

V1:
Oh great, it's too late, there's no escape
Said I like what we have but I always debate
Cuz I stay analyzing' to see if you relate
Constantly tossing the thought if this is 'Fake or Fate'?
So I won't bring it up
Cuz i know deep down you don't give a fuck
You're a free spirit, my hippie, i know whats up
You're a free spirit, my hippie, i know whats up
So cuffing's really not an option
Told me "Don't catch feelings", i've forgotten
But how can you blame me for you being poppin'?
Fuck around and make me spoil you rotten
Shit really ain't fair
But you been through more, so I wouldn't dare
Try to be some extra stress in your hair
Or some extra shit you just hate to compare
I retract everything I say to you
Can you sit here and say I look OK to you?
If you say yes, I think its for the best
That I create a barricaded space from you
Cuz you don't know me like I thought you did
Im a grown ass woman, not some fucking kid
& don't sit here & say you grown
Just cuz you got a job and living on your own
You don't ever settle, all you do is roam
To whoever gives you money or some dome
All you care about is attention
Im real rude if i forgot to mention
But for some reason I got a soft spot
Cuz you cool me down whenever Im hot
Im hope you keepin' up, because i won't stop
I'll smash through it if there is a roadblock and
Dive off a cliff in the name of love
I know I'm good, Ima fly up above
Unless I dive down in a dark abyss
Where hate is alive & never missed
You got me talking crazy shit
Going on and on, Im full of it
But this is me, all of me, not just a bit
You won't let me show you love unless its from the lips?
Tell me what type of shit is this?
But its my fault for being so lenient
As much as it tears me apart, she got my heart
Making it so damn convenient

Chorus:
Sittin' here in this Orange room
Really trying not to feel Green
Cuz if I end up turning Blue
Imma fuck up the whole thing 2x

& if i could give you anything
It'd be way more than some fucking ring
I love we got so much common
& i really love it when we vibin'
Smokin' & Drinkin'
I love when you tell me what you thinkin'
Give me a taste of yo' mind
Or just give me a bit of yo' time
But i know i can't have it all
Cuz in the end your girl would be so appalled
So that's it, Im gone...

[I - Colossus}
[Verse]
Went to Six Flags, six fags came up
And said "Ayo! Can we get a pic?" I said no
And they said "Oh! It's Wolf Gang, "Yonkers", Goblin is my shit though"
Now I'm like, "fuck, I don't want to be an asshole"
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot (Tyler's here!)
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, "Hey, Tyler, can I...?"
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard "Radicals," the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song "Bastard" right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, "Fuck, is he speaking to me?"
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to "In Search Of..." and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like "fuck"
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a "hey" (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play "VCR"
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors..."
All right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
"Yonkers" and "Yonkers" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about "Yonkers"
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say "Sagan Lockhart" and when you came out to "Sandwitches"
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started"

Just take this fucking picture man, shit

[II - PartyIsntOver]

[Verse: Tyler The Creator]
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me

[III - Campfire]

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator]
Yeah, um
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting

[Interlude: Kids]
We're making s'mores by the campfire
Camp Flog Gnaw, Golf Wang summer

[Verse 2: Laetitia Sadier]
Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, but radical
Transformation, ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart

[Interlude: Tyler, the Creator]
Yo bring the bass back in
Yeah, haha
Who ate all the fuckin' chocolate?
Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha
Yeah
I ain't trying to go home, really

And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator & (Frank Ocean)]
Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame Impala
(It'll get dark outside soon)
And I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You’re fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don’t know, I think you’re chill
(Ride for)
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Mmmm it’ll get dark outside, soon (My baby, ride for me)
Where the street lights trail (My baby, ride for me)
You ain’t gotta lie to kick it darling
It’s cool we’re moving slow

[Bridge: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer

You remind me of my bimmer

[Outro: Lionel]
Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
I got a can of these baked beans too



[Verse]
He came up in Dallas
Had no hazel in his eyes
Had them sailors on his thighs
When he's lit he show 'em
Kept it faded on the sides
We were seeing someone
We was dating on the side
He was seeing double
I was spinning hula
We were spending so much time
It was getting cooler
All this drillin' got the dick feelin' like a power tool
Finna move a nigga out his momma house now
That's a power move
That's what I gotta do, for real
Would that diamond shine for real?
Shine for real

You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved

[Hook]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock

Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock

[Verse 2]
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

My brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds (Sound)
Don't no one hear the shells (Shells)

Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana

How's the gutter doing?

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
My sister called the other day and said she loved me, wassup?
I called her back and said I'm sorry I don't say it enough
See I don't put up a front, I just say what I want, nigga
Never let a nigga tell me I couldn't stunt, uh
Pro black but this twink white (white)
I'll sign if the ink right (right)
Two cribs, I can sleep twice (twice)
Niggas swear they woke but got crust in their eyes
They can't blink right (woo!)
These niggas fake confidence and fake show how they feel
Then go home and big cry because that acne is real
Show them scars motherfucker
How you think they gon' heal up?
Scab ass niggas fucking up all the deals
I got niggas tryna slander me, I knew from the start
But I can't do it back to them, it ain't no hate in my heart
Y'all Stephen Hawkings with the way that y'all make moves
But I'ma flip the channel on you niggas
Just stay tuned and watch em
I'm the real Fresh Prince, new crib in Bel Air
And I feel so free, the cheetah print in my hair (woo!)
Rainbow on the belt, gang shit yeah yeah
I hopped out that bitch, had to make some room for my furs
Niggas picking out their victims, hot potato, hot potato
Tryna' cancel me on Twitter, but got limits on ya' data
Tell the engineer to turn me all the way up on the faders
Because everything I'm dropping hot as fuck like clumsy waiters

It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
8 minutes ago it was all okay, yeah
I wish the year was just missing one day
I'm wishing I could forget it
'Cos it's still so hard to live with it

[Pre-Hook]
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away
[Verse 2]
It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
Walking on 42nd tryna' clear my brain (no, oh)
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
So for 24 hours I'll been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space

[Bridge]
See I don't even wanna think about him
Or dream about him
Even just one day is one too long
There ain't no sense in bringing it up or bringing memory round
'Cause ain't no getting back the love is gone
I won't be crying no more no water will fall
The storm has passed and gone
And I wish amnesia would stay
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day

And made us new
And took us through
And woke us up
I believe that no matter what
It can make us new
Take us through it
And wake us up again
What we had won't be the same now
But you will make something new
And it'll take you through this

You better duck, run fast from the mania
Don't stare, don't laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya'
Don't let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up, and they'll shoot ya'
Face off, face off Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same law
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion
Watch em' close enough
Don't let the holster break or roast ya'
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon' switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner?
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine
On the up and up this life
'Til we're down on our luck
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine (Oh, you scared?)
On the up and up this life
'Til the lift gets stuck (You scared of?)
Lifting up, lifting up
Lifting up
Coming down, coming down
Coming down (I don't mind)
Make 'em look, make 'em look
To the sound

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
We were going home
Waiting for the kids
School bus to arrive
Oh, but you know, they're gonna do it anyway
Reaching for your keys
Wait, is that your phone?
Got a TBI
Wait, is that police?
Get out for what?
I'm not your guy
(But you know, they're gonna do it anyway)
Wife behind the trees
Tryna to tell you don't
They're about to fire
(They're gonna do it anyway)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You better duck, run fast from the mania
Don't stare, don't laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya'
Don't let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up, and they'll shoot ya'
Face off, face off Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same law
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion
Watch em' close enough
Don't let the holster break or roast ya'
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon' switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner?
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do itIt was morning when you called me last
Reminiscing of the past
Talked all day till you had to leave
And you promised that you'd call me back

But if you want to stay like you do
You'd never have to be that rude
You wouldn't drag me down
Oh please don't leave me now

I saw you standing by a pay phone
Thought those feelings were long gone
Said you'd see it through
And i stood next to you
Never thought you'd leave me, but now

You want to stay, do you?
Dont come running back
I thought we were done with that
You ain't ever been so rude
Leave me alone won't you

But i don't need you now
I thought you wouldn't believe me but now you
Said you want it back
You won't stop thinking bout that
Please don't leave me now
Oh please don't leave me now

[Verse 1]
You said I'd never make it well I'm here
You told me I should go and sleep off the dreams
You promised I would stop having nightmares
If I could do my best to just not believe

[Pre-Hook]
Say I'm infatuated with my future
Too in love with tomorrow
And that tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home

[Hook]
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer

[Verse 2]
Villain with a dagger was chasing me
I woke up and you were standing right there
You kissed me and said that's just a bad one babe
Then I asked you what's that in your hand
[Pre-Hook]
You told me I'm infatuated with my future
Too in love with tomorrow
You say tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home

[Hook]
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sleep good as soon as you're gone
But I can't dream good as long as long as

[Hook]
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me

Who's that talking in the library?
Who's that talking in my library? Is that you?
No, I won't put you out
'Cause what would this place be without my muse?
Nothing special

[Pre-Chorus]
Every book in here, I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of, some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote
Wish I could revise them, but there's no erasing
And the best advice I got was keep writing, yeah
And keep living, yeah
And keep loving
Oh, loving and living and loving

[Chorus]
And when the ink dries
And the pages turn to dust, so will we
Turn to dust, so will we
Dust, dust

[Verse 2]
Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library? Is that you?
No, I won't put you out
'Cause what would this place be without your smile?
Nothing special
[Pre-Chorus]
I fell in love with you, girl, oh-ooh
You let yourself inside, with no respect for privacy
You said, "There's too much on my mind"
Then you ripped out a page
And set that shit on flame, I quit writing
Oh-ooh, I kept living, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, ugh
I kept loving, ah, ah

[Chorus]
And when the ink dries
And the pages turn to dust, so will we
Turn to dust, so will we
Dust, dust

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Do you remember, that October night
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started
I thought that we were

[Pre Hook: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
I guess what we have doesn't matter

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
All I ever did was just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome, (t-tell me that I'm wrong)
But I thought we were

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter

[Hook: Frank Ocean & James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying
Fighting, every night
Dying
Fighting, every night

[Hook: Frank Ocean & James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle, oh....

I saw you, Chinese birthday
With a strawberry icee
Channeling Morrissey
Were we at the rave, dancing horribly
Pulse went through my face and my clear backpack
Sonic sound you made me
I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need
Hope you don't think I'm easy
What starts inside these hallways
Always comes and goes
I come from nothing
Like you come from nothing
Light like a laser cut from the navel
Til it's dark as a plum
Back where we're from
Don't take life so serious
If you find another
He could sleep right here
Between the two of us
I'll move over some
I hope he doesn't think I'm easy
Between the three of us
There's no one sleeping cold
Nobody said it would be easy
With you on my mind
I'm scared to think alone
Ohh why was it never this easy
The windows raise to show us
Daylight's come again

[Part I: End]

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

[Outro]
There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see

[Part II: Golden Girl]

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight
But I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night
But I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes)
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
I'mma stay right here, with you
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
'Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes)
I've found my gold

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Um, thanks for fuckin' with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl, I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green

[Outro]



[Skit]
Something is wrong -

I don't really have a dick in my ass

Even joking about it, that something is wrong. Is that what you're saying you want? Oh my Lord!

[character chuckles hysterrically]

Is that something you said you would like to experience? There's nothing funny about it

Nah, I really don't want a dick in my ass

I mean honestly. No, no, no, but why would you even be joking like that here at this place?

'Cause I was just playing

You don't do that -

But I wasn't even talking 'bout myself, I was talking 'bout somebody else. I was talking 'bout how this one gay dude act

Okay, but what was this when you—when you first came up? African music as well as an African market

Come on cuz, I'm—I'm hungry cuz

Hold on. What is the African market?

[Outro:]
You're listening to Blonded Radio



[Verse 1]
Hell yeah
A blind boy sees a green girl
She drives a green car through a dream world
She meets up with a green club
And talks of saving the earth from itself
A blind boy saw a blue man
Who rides a blue bus through a nightmare
He leaves word to a blue home
But the blue seems different since she's passed away

[Pre-Chorus]
And the same boy with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

[Verse 2]
A blind boy became a kind man
Who painted white lights on a canvas
He once said he didn't write songs
Cause making music would be selfish
And back then he saw the flags fly
Seen them fight and divide for it
He said war is for those who foresee it
But what good is border to me yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And the same man with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

[Bridge]
I said "I wish you could see the ocean"
He said "I wish you could see hope"
I said "have you ever seen the mountain?"
He said "no, but my faith could move those"
Ohhh woah
I said "I wish you could see the stars"
He told me I should see love
Love
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen



[Skit: SebastiAn]
Oh, I was just telling that I got this, this girl before
And I was together since three years
And uh, I was not even cheating her or what
And Facebook arrived and, uh
She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it, because I was, like, in front of her
In front of her, and she told me, like, "Accept me on Facebook"
It was virtual, means no sense
So I say, "I'm in front of you
I don't need to accept you on Facebook"
She starting to be crazy
She thought that because I didn't accept her
She thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, "It's, it's over, I can't believe you"
I said, "Come on, you're crazy, because like, yeah
I'm in front of you, I'm every day, here in your house"
That's, it means, like, it's jealousy
Pure jealousy, for nothing
You know, virtual thing

This is how molly must feel
How molly must feel word
Molly must feel, word
Know what I mean

[Verse 1]
Coming to you live, from California, California
We can drive half way across the stateside of California
Would you mind if I let the top down to feel the California
And all I see in the sky is sapphire blowing clouds of diamonds
Ive got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to do nothing to do
The beach is kind of average but the mushrooms are magic
When we've got nothing got nothing got nothing to do nothing to do
Im signing off the network I hope you're down to try to
There must be something something something to do

[Verse 2]
Coming to you
From California California
We can fly half way across the world now
From California
Would you mind if I let the top down to feel the California
And if you ask me why the birds sing then you know it's true
There's never nothing nothing nothing to do

(Really, though, I think)

Fertilizer
I'll take bullshit if that's all you got
Some fertilizer

[Verse 1]
Slip it in her drink, and in the blink of an eye
I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit
The judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link
Contended her to meet me at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fuckin' and we only met last week
We were both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
And it reeks on the sheet, girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie 'em and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go
[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh
(Yeah) Oh, oh (Wolf Gang)
(Wolf Haley) Oh, ohh (How you doin'?)
(All good?) Oh, oh (Cool)
(We cool?) Oh, ohh (I'm upset)

[Verse 2]
Bitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip
Make her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon
Busting Ottoman cannons, on the pill
Is he real? Gaza stripping (In my living room)
Wolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms (Mushrooms)
I'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon
This fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating

[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh
[Bridge: Frank Ocean & (Tyler, The Creator)]
(Frankie, Frankie)
Now I'd like to take this time of day
To thank the Mother Earth (Thank you Momma, thank you Momma, fish!)
Letting the sun shine down on the lake
While I fish your waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)
'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool
He on the loose, yeah (Yeah)

[Outro]
Got to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait
Wait 'til you see the semen swimming
Baby, please not half, the whole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion
Makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can’t get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you
You’re fucking wet, fish
[Part 2: Boppin' Bitch]

[Chorus]
So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin'

[Verse 1]
This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she’s a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more Dora-looking sluts let me explore
Until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

[Chorus]
Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch (That's right), she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'

[Verse 2]
This little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn’t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

[Interlude]
Now, now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we can’t fuck with this bitch, y'all? (That bitch she boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')

[Chorus]
Now I'm at a fuckin' clinic
'Cause my dick is swollen and keeps itchin'
Nigga, I'ma kill this bitch (She's a boppin' bitch)
Bitch (She a boppin' bitch)
She a boppin' bitch

[Outro]

I heard you could fly, could you try

[Pre-Chorus]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
I’m spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don’t ever let me down

[Chorus]
Don’t try to hide it
Cause I’d see your wings if that dress was backless
Don’t hide it

Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don’t try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Bridge]
Gravity’s blowing up my phone, don’t wanna answer
Them sidewalks calling to me (yeah)
Gravity’s calling my phone, I can’t answer
Ain’t no service way up here girl
We’re twenty-five thousand feet in the air baby
If love was sky, damn right I’m falling
Falling in love, but going up

[Chorus]
Don’t try to hide it, cause I see your wings
If that dress looks fabulous, don’t hide it
It ain’t a secret
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don’t try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Outro]

Said I won't let go until you feel you’re ready
'Til you feel you’re ready

Told me on the phone
Something bout you love me
Ooh baby say it to my face

Kinda like your army, your air force, your peace corps

[Chorus]
So baby follow, follow, follow
Tell me where you want to go
Just keep your body close and don't let go
Follow, follow, follow

Just listen for the signs
And when I tell you right, left, switch it up
Imma take it slow, Imma take it slow, oh
Oh baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control, oh
Now baby look up at the star
If you wanna go, promise we can go, oh
You just gotta follow, follow, follow
You just gotta follow, follow, follow

[Verse Two]
Oh, baby if you like
We can go to paradise
Be back by the next sunrise
And no, I won't stay in Rome
I never go faster the limit, not unless you with it

And you told me on the phone
Said you wanna love me
Well baby tell me how it feels
Gotta have place in your world
Something like no other, your lover, your best friend, oh

[Chorus]
So baby follow, follow, follow
Tell me where you want to go
Just keep your body close and don't let go
Follow, follow, follow

Hell yeah, switch it up
No we just can't let it fall down
Gotta keep it that, that, that, that
I can never quite get enough
Gotta keep your back arched up
Follow the leader, baby girl
It's going down, down, down
Down down down

[Alternate Chorus]
Now move it right, left, switch it up

[Intro]
I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

[Verse 1]
I know you, Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous, Forrest
Forrest Gump

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

I was screaming, "Run forty-four!"
But you kept running past the end zone
Oh, where'd you go, Forrest?

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
The rings all ringed out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
We found out

[Verse 1]
I saw the train coming for me
With the force of a million marching
(Train coming in)
But I believe in us
(Train coming in)
I felt the eyes of so many
The whispers and shouts about
My belief in us
(Whispers I hear)
I believe in us
(Shouts in my ear)

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the cloaks on the judges
Flaws in the judgements
Beasts in the dungeon
That don't scare me
(Don't scare me, don't scare me)
And I'll say it on a mountain
Say it all in public
Hold a press conference
To speak about my freedom
My freedom

[Chorus]
Just us, Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us, Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us, I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us, Freedom!
Just us, Freedom!
[Verse 2]
I flew away this morning
What if I ran away and never came back
(I ran away and never come back)
And all of the fame means nothing
It's all a game and the gladiator just won't win
(its all a game, just a game)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I see cloaks on the judges
Flaws in the judgements
Beasts in the dungeon
Don't bring scared to me (no no)
(Don't scare me, don't scare me)
And I'll say it on a mountain
Say it out in public
Hold my head high
I'm a speak about my freedom
My freedom!!!

[Chorus]
Just us, Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us, Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us, I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us, Freedom!
Just us, Freedom!
[Bridge]
Free to run, on the water
Free to believe, free to love
Free to speak that mountain off the ground
I believe in us

[Chorus]
Just us, Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us, Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us, I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us, Freedom!
Just us, Freedom!

[Outro]
My Freedom
My Freedom
My Freedom
Freedom, freedom

[Freestyle: Frank Ocean]
I didn't think even think about this shit
But your bitch finna get a mink about this shit
You know what I'm saying I'm on Fifth and Broadway in this bitch
And now I'm at New York with my clip on my wrist
Yeah, nigga it's twelve on my wrist and twenty on my neck bitch
Yeah, you know what I'm saying, it's really nothing
And I really got the bars going, really nothing
And Basedgod ain't this fucking based
And get this camera out my fucking face

{Intro: Joseph Noah}
Sir, excuse me sir ay, um, would you like to check out my mixtape?
It's called *Fringe*
Excuse me ma'am, ma'am. How are you?
Would you like to check out my mixtape?
Well, at least y'all want to hear my music
Check it

{Verse 1}
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
It's two kids in the swimming pool
I'm not brave (I'm not brave)
Yeah

{Verse 2}
Just look into my life and understand all that I've seen
I been rejected from my friends and my family
I'm living on the edge and it feels like I'm lost and I'm losing my sanity
Just because I chose to chase an impossible dream, yeah
Check it I can't relate to my peers
The moment I'm unaccepted is the moment I fear
To outside the fringes places frigid and cold
Don't tell me how to fit in I'm too unique for your mold look
The outside, the fringe please don't call me your friend
You label me something else when you stop letting me in
The outside, the fringe this feels like home to me
'Cause being stuck on the inside means that you are not free
And they might tell you who to be
But love don't come from your acceptance in society
Fringe
(I'm not brave)
(Brave)

FUCK THE OPPOSITION.

I'M WINNING.

& EVEN WHEN I’M NOT WINNING, I'mma HAVE THESE AWESOME MEMORIES OF WINNING.

but i don’t plan on ever not winning. so…yeah, i don’t know what to tell these hoes.



[Intro]
Alright, hold on

[Verse 1]
If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day
And not skip a meal, I'm good
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour
Call my Momma like, "Momma
I ain't making minimum wage, Momma
I'm on, Momma, I'm on
Now  I'm making 400, 600, 800K, Momma
To stand on my feet, Momma
Play these songs, it's therapy, Momma
They paying me, Momma
I should be paying them
I should be paying y'all, honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me, Momma
Let me run this bitch
I'ma run it into the ground, Momma, the whole galaxy
God damn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you niggas
Fuck me if I hated on you

[Verse 2]
I'ma stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga, you got some just like me don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Family tree, throw a big shadow
(Jamming to the rhythm)
Tech company
Please gimme immortality
(It's a face to face)
I'm going rapidly, fading drastically
(Keep me high, Castrati)
(Punani fade the stress)
Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now
(Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway)
Smoke some'n
(Marks on that freeway)
They tryna find 2Pac, don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press, he escape the stress
La da da da da, la da da da da
La da da da da (la da da da da)

[Verse 3]
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena, they wanna murder a nigga
Murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cut bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my four door
I only got one four door
Remember when I had that Lexus, no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song so, I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas want fight in the streets
Now shit starting to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog this is chess now, not fetch
I ain't runnin' for a nigga, ain't ran since track meet
That's the only time I ran from a nigga
You could change this track now
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago
—know and —know, —know and —know
Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th though
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and Matt know
Shit went 180 on me, please run that back though
(Tucks til 24)

[Skit]
You say some shit about me?
Turn a real sport, my nigga
That second time Jerron was there, nigga
On God he grabbed me and then that nigga tried to pull me
Yeah, 'cause the nigga tried to boom me in my face
I had AD in a headlock, nigga, I had this nigga like—

Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
This love will keep us from blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
This love will keep us from blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
This love will keep us from blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind



[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

[Verse 2: dvsn]
God has my soul but you have my heart
Will string to the end, that's where we'll start
And it's a long way, you're lost
I lose myself, I found you
You're like kinda like I found you
Could you use that if I can't guide you
That to me, I'll be

[Hook: Frank Ocean & dvsn]
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

[Bridge: Frank Ocean & Kim Burrell]
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Until it's time
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
It's 'til it's time we die
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

[Outro: Kim Burrell]
Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh



Steely walks down a street with the pace of someone with some place to go but who has left early enough to get there. He holds a rectangular metallic card smaller than his palms with grooves on its surface. The street is quiet, the sidewalk clean. As he walks, he occasionally slows to peer inside the windows of parked cars. The cars have a familiar look though it’s obvious their designs are several generations ahead. The elegant lines, the materials and tech apparent in the construction are the result of years of engineering advances beyond the present.

The city feels simultaneously old and new, weathered by time and progress, lending it a distinctive quality. A modern city embracing technology but somewhat overtaken by nature, still trying to find a balance. There are pick-ups and wagons amongst the luxury cars, very democratic. Steely peers into a car with a cigarette in the ashtray. Using the metallic card, he swipes it against the car’s access strip and gains entry. He steals the cig, lights it and walks a few cars down. He notices a hanging air freshener in another car and decides he likes it, breaks into that car as well taking the fragrant contraband. The stillness is mesmerizing, you can barely hear the autobahn in the distance or the steps of his companion just a few feet ahead.

Caged court centered in a park somewhat densely populated with live oak trees, their limbs perfectly frame rather than reach above the court. Clark is around 5’10” or 11”, lean but strapping and towering compared to a seemingly younger Steely who just beamed a ball at Clark and nearly landed a punch before Robb and Matthew body-blocked.  Clark would have hurt him, badly, obviously, as Steely is a few years younger and developing a physique to match his mental toughness.

     Robb: ‘Whoa whoa whoa level down…’
     Matthew: ‘Kiss and make up, friends. It’s a contact sport.’
     Steely: ‘Nah, miss me with that, he always tryna big man somebody.’
     Clark: (Checks his face for blood. Spits.) ‘Game point.’

Steely steps up to guard him, placing his hand on Clark’s side to telegraph his movements. Clark crosses him, drives and lays the ball up, winning the game.

     Clark: ‘Whoo! (RIC FLAIR voice) Did you feel that? Did you sense the sublime finesse and technique just then? You should be grateful. You should be grateful for me. Here.’
     Steely: ‘Blah, blah, blah.’ (Shrugs and mimes, picks the dead basketball up off the ground and does a tricky slam dunk with excess energy.)

The quiet of the morning scene continues, Steely and Shoobie continue walking as if in a dream. No birds, no other people, no sounds of cars. You see cars though, and you can hear a faint wind occasionally disrupt the silence as it passes between the rubber of the vehicles and the concrete. The skyline is a blended ecosystem of the natural world and school buildings. Tall structures of glass, steel, brick and mortar raised on stilts of a hard clear substance. Limbs of trees reaching out through some windows, you see entire floors made into greenhouses and pocket jungles sprawling off rooftops. They approach a park where we see a sculpture of a child hanging from the sky from a string that goes up forever, touching the surface of a never ending rippling pond below with the tip of his finger. There are no paths of stone or concrete, the grounds are riddled with ever so slight inclines and valleys. There’s a large Olympic sized pool built with Carrara marble, students ice skate it during the winter and skateboard in it in warmer months.

Shoobie walks slowly ahead of Steely, carrying a slate of metal, head held high, inhaling deeply and gratefully from a harmless, flavored steam cigarette. She squints her large eyes eyes on a toke and looks back at Steely going inside of someone else’s car.  The colors of her eyes change. She keeps walking. Steely catches up and throws his arm around Shoobie — he quickly takes his arm back to himself then grabs both her elbows and turns her toward him.

     Shoobie: (Bobbing her head to music that isn't playing, she sings) 'That's the way everyday goes, every time we've no control...'

Steely looks up at the sky. A wide, flat translucent aircraft is coasting slowly above, leaving clouds in its wake and filtering sunlight into beautiful prismatic refractions onto him.

He's looking down at Shoobie, she's wearing radiation protective gear. Her helmet is mirrored orange and red, the suit has a white body. He focuses on her and not the campus being destroyed behind her by fire.

     Steely: ‘Is death a high? I heard it’s like DMT. The guy who told me that isn’t dead. Maybe it’s worth dying. The high I mean. Worst part about it though. We won’t remember being so tight you know? Look at us!’

(Brushes imaginary locks from his face)

     Shoobie: ‘...uhh?’

Steely looks down at his feet and there’s ice on the grass though it’s summer. Steely pulls his head up to say ‘snow’ but doesn’t even make the begining sounds of the word. A single ball of alloy, white encoded with ice, spins around them like a tether ball to its pole. Shoobie still mouthing the words to a song playing in her head. ‘If you could fly then you’d feel south, up north’s gettin’ cold soon…The way it is were on land — still i’m someone to hold true’.



Steely is walking barefoot through a hardwood hallway into a kitchen space that is futuristic and primitive at the same time. The kitchen consists of a small pool of self-replenishing fresh water, light cleansers instead of soaps, a BBQ pit, a stone oven, cabinets that are refrigerated and store food, dishes and cutlery. The floor is perforated with vents that heat and vacuum the floor for debris. Potted plants are in the windows as well as above the pool of water. Steely takes two bowls out of a cabinet, a knife, two spoons, a jar of milk, honeycomb, and bananas off a hook. He begins to prepare one bowl of oatmeal and one bowl of cereal. He slices a banana on a wood cutting board, places the banana slices on top of both bowls, swirls some honey on the oatmeal then walks back through the hallway.

The hardwood hallway extends into a room where Shoobie is seated in front of a white desk with a translucent top that is eventually lit from beneath. She’s sketching schematics with graphite while 3-D printing small pieces of the design from the sketch paper directly. Steely places the cereal on her table and sits on a full-sized bed cornered against the far left wall. Steely eats and looks around the room. Photos and schematics are placed on the wall, bed sheets spill onto the floor and Shoobie’s wearing PE shorts, varsity hoodie, ankle socks and a messy ponytail. It’s a perfectly lived-in moment that feels right in the ways you’d hope for when two people comfortably cohabitate. Just then he noticed a message in his field of vision.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Matthew:  ‘wya? wyd?’
     Steely:  ‘I’m here man. breakfast.’
     Matthew:  ‘ole oatmeal eatin’ ass boy’
     Danny:  ‘all star suck me ups last night’
Steely: ‘who?’
     Danny:  ‘imma bring her and her friend out to the water.’
     Steely:  ‘oh, OK.’
     Mathew: ‘about to shower---’
     Steely::‘Yea, I gotta do the same rn.’

Steely puts the phone down and finishes his bowl of oatmeal. Shoobie’s cereal sits untouched where he placed it, getting soggy.

Steely returns to the kitchen, puts the bowl in a light wash rack. He pulls on a shallow drawer and grabs a refrigerated metal slate from a stack of four. The slate responds to his touch, turning transparent while a swarm of light particles activate a 3-D projection an inch off its surface, making a mold of his hand. Steely places his hand into the particle mold then gets up and walks into the bathroom down the hall, to the right, then left of two bathrooms. Steely sits on the toilet and begins to masturbate to a video now playing on the slate. The ground changes hue.

There’s a signal that class is about to begin.

     Shoobie: ‘I’m going to class.’
     Steely: ‘Should go together.’
     Shoobie: ‘Yea – what about yours?’
     Steely: ‘I wasn’t going to go in there till later.’
     Shoobie: ‘Irrational fears again?
     Steely: ‘Naw…’
     Shoobie: ‘They won’t let you come into class late…’ (Steely cuts her off)
     Steely: ‘I know.’
     Shoobie: ‘Truant.’ (Stares him down)

They kiss. Steely leans into it a bit and reaches under her skirt. Students are watching them. She punches him playfully in the chest and he backs off. Steely leaves Shoobie standing there, while he disappears down a decline, through a grove of trees.

Steely arrives at the entrance to a gated community, as behind him a bullet train hydroplanes silently along a narrow band of water. He lights a flavored cigarette, drops it on the ground by accident and picks it up, he puffs it to keep it alive as he walks towards a guard post. As he approaches, a woman in her fifties hangs her head out of the doorway of the security quarters. Her name is Florence and it’s apparent she knows Steely.

Florence works multiple locations as a security guard and as Steely has developed his hobby of breaking into cars, he’s also developed a relationship with Florence. She suspects what he does but looks the other way, treating him as a favorite aunt would. She has a soft spot for him and occasionally Steely brings her cigarettes or coffee or a flower picked up along the way.

There are two mesh steel hates. In front of the gates are a row of solid metal cylindrical posts that swivel up and down into the ground.

     Florence: ‘C’mon child.’ (Lazily)

Steely speeds up to a slight jog up to her half door/half window.

     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘Put that out.’
     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘I’m proud of you. You know that, don’t you?’
     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘Give me a square, son.’

Steely goes in his parka pocket and hands two to the woman – she puts one to her mouth and lights it.

     Florence:  ‘Mmmhmm, go head on.’ (Turns an eye without turning her head.)

The gates clear, the posts lower.

Steely walks through the gates and down many stairs. Before exiting the stair well he stops to read a series of text messages from various senders.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Mia: ‘Another thought on perfection. The only problem with her is that she is too perfect. She is bad in a way that entices, and good in a way that comforts. She is mischief but then she is the warmth of home. The dreams of the wild and dangerous but the memories of childhood and gladness. She is perfection. And when given something perfect, it is the nature of man to dedicate his mind to finding something wrong with it and then when he is able to find something wrong with it, he rejoices in his find, and sees only the flaw, becoming blind to everything else! And this is why man is never given anything that is perfect, because when given the imperfect and the ugly, man will dedicate his mind to finding what is good with the imperfect and upon finding one good thing with the extremely flawed, he will only see the one good thing, and no longer see everything else that is ugly. And so...man complains to God for having less than what he wants...but this is the only thing that man can handle. Man cannot handle what is perfect. It is the nature. It is the nature of the mortal to rejoice over the one thing that he can proudly say that he found on his own, with no help from another, whether it be a shadow in a perfect diamond, or a faint beautiful reflection in an extremely dull mirror.

     Steely: ‘Sorry, I hope you feel better.’

     Steely: ‘You’re not athletic.’
     Clark: ‘We could line it up.’
     Steely: ‘You week, haha.’

NEXT TEXTS, STEELY READS BUT DOESN’T RESPOND:

     Unknown contact: ‘Have a day you dreamed of.’
     Andree (Pacific islander): ‘One more pak and I’ll drop it.’
     Kio: ‘BITCHES LOVE YOU.’

     Shoobie: ‘Who r u with rn?’
     Steely: ‘No one :/’
     Shoobie: ‘Matthew’s house? bored. misu.’

He finishes his correspondence and continues on. The stairwell opens to a strip where two wide roads sit, parallel but not separate. The left-hand road leads to a Cape Cod  style country club and what looks like a beach. Near the country club, a split in the main road leads to another wide, two-way road where the opposite directions are paved at different heights, like a shelf. There’s a black sand beach on one side and mature manicured hedges on the other; the tops of homes are visible. Steely walks down the road and as he passes a second block, the road narrows and inclines to a cavernous walkway that winds through the greater community.

A guys with a long curly afro, wearing a white hooded jacket with 3M accents, shorts, waist weights, and Nike running shoes comes out of a property. He jogs in place and does some light stretches. Steely walks up to the guy who turns out to be his friend Matthew, while casually running his fingers across the hedges. The two of them wave low and perfunctorily at each other then cross paths. Though there’s acknowledgement, it seems a bit clandestine as if they’re about to set something in motion.

Matthew jogs downhill with his arms outstretched and banks right into a still narrower canopied alley. Steely stays in place and keeps time. Matthew is now jogging perfectly center though a lane with mesh steel garage door every 50 years. He picks up the pace in his jog as you see the garage door open ten yards ahead – a white single-seater begins to speed out the garage but manages to stop right before hitting Matthew. Matthew acts startled.

     Matthew:  (Yelling at the Garten, and slamming his hands on the hood) ‘DAMN – NICE BREAKS!’

Matthew then jogs on following the car as it speeds in a straight line away from the scene till it’s no longer visible. Matthew hits a corner, makes a right and meets Steely back in front of Matthew’s house. They walk inside the yard gate through hedges and past fountains down a ramp into a cave like living space with an unobstructed view of the ocean.

They pass cleaning staff and art leaning up against the walls. Outside the window you can see where his yard slopes down to the ocean side cliff. There’s a pool with a high dive, a solarium, a lone, odd colored dog sits gazing at them as they walk through the house and towards Matthew’s bedroom. Matthew changes clothes quickly as Steely is talking to him about weed.

     Matthew:  ‘Fronto leaves?? – You act like you discovered fire.’
     Steely:  ‘You ever catch Mr. and Mrs. Hagen intimate – in their moment. I’d bet you haven’t, because they’re stuck with you. How free will they be when you’re out on your own? There’s a place for you in this world bro and I’m your friend, ok?’
     Matthew:  ‘You’re acting out now, you can stop.’
     Steely:  ‘Mrs. Hagen I’m sure is still very agile on that horse.’
     Matthew:  ‘You want some water or something?’
     Steely:  ‘Yea. Do you dance still. You used to be a good dancer. (Walks away to kitchen)
     Matthew:  ‘Pour my shake out the blender!’
     Steely:  (Calling out from kitchen) ‘Nah, you don’t have any ice!’
     Matthew:  (Calling out from bedroom) ‘Who the fuck said anything about ice?!’’
     Steely:  ‘Sorry, you know I really appreciate you buddy. I couldn’t find anything quite right for Shoobie’s birthday – everything’s so generic to her, she just scans it with her computer eyes.’

Steely walks into the bedroom again, Matthew is ready to leave. Steely hands him a shake and eats small pieces of fruit while finishing a blue can of Coke. The two of them exit Matthew’s room into an area where nothing else is in the shot apart from a right-hand drive Nissan Skyline from a hundred years ago and a small orange groove. Steely re-lights the fronto leaf blunt.

     Matthew:  ‘Put the fronto out. Drive.’

Later on the drive.

     Steely:  ‘I can’t think it’s too many notes.’
     Steely:  ‘He’s not on the 5 yet. That’s impossible.’
     Matthew:  ‘People are fucked.’
     Steely:  ‘He’s taking his time. How did he look when you ran into him?’
     Matthew:  ‘People are so fucked… Uhh, yea – he looked really happy to see me.’
     Steely:  ‘What are you talking..(cuts himself off)? Why are people fucked? That include you or nah?’
     Matthew: ‘People are just bad, like, toward other people. I should quit giving this traffic...but I can’t.’
     Steely:  ‘You gonna tell me something I don’t know?’ (Says this with the look on his face and not words.)
     Matthew:  ‘I showed you this already, but watch again.’ Handing Steely his phone to watch something.
     Matthew:  ‘When the lady gets sent to the neighbors house by her uncle to fight someone and she ends up running and getting chased, then falls down, breaks her shit and they set her on fire..’
     Steely:  ‘Yea, that hurt my feelings. She seemed to confident.’
     Steely:  ‘Did you listen to that Goye thing I told you about?’
     Matthew:  ‘Yeah. Are those lights new?’ (Looking at lights that follow the highway railing.)

Topography blurred outside the vehicle grass – suburbia and city overlapping – hyper color – non specific.

Matthew pulls into a sprawling office campus. We see a network of buildings, there are people from the company walking about engaged in conversation. One group in particular is huddled and highlighted.

     Colleague #1:  ‘Exploded?!’
     Colleague #2:  ‘Without heat?’
     Colleague #3:  ‘Yeah, or human shrapnel.’
     Colleague #2:  ‘So absent of heat, absence of residual bio and absent of our guy.’
     Colleague #1:  ‘He’s jumped on grenades before and lived.’
     Colleague #2:  ‘Chemiluminescence isn’t the mark of a grenade.’
     Colleague #3:  ‘Maybe saving the world a few times makes you eligible for dharmic ascension?’

Office campus is a ‘CAR FREE IS A CAREFREE’ zone – there is offsite parking for commuters.

Matthew’s car is stopped. They trade places at the wheel and Steely gets out. He walks towards the outskirts of the office campus. Matthew tries to pull unto the parking structure which is multi-level and underground. He begins to argue with the security person manning the entrance.

     Matthew:  ‘Why are you telling me I can’t park here?? It’s a free world.’
     Parking Security:  ‘Credentials please, sir? Sir. Sir. This is a corporate facility, credentials please.’
     Matthew:  ‘What’s the corporate ever done for me?! Huh? Since you know every God damn thing. What they done?? I should sit down right here and take a hot shit in the facilities.’

Steely walks down the ramp into the structure casually, trying not to be noticed – the distracted guard notices and chases after him shouting about credentials. Steely breaks into a sprint. Seconds later a small low flying autonomous aircraft is heard in pursuit of Steely down the structure.  Steely spot’s Garten’s car, the one that almost hit Matthew earlier, slides over the tip of it and almost falls of the edge of the parking structure which cascades into a waterfall, leading down into channels below street level.

Steely regains his balance and struggles with his car boosting key card, trying to gain access to Garten’s car. It isn’t letting him into the car and he begins to panic, but finally it clicks on – you can hear the whistle and the buzz of the security drone flying towards him. He slides down the seat so as not to be visible from the window. The drone flies to the edge of the parking structure and hovers, observing downward as the water flows. It then turns around and heads back to continue its search elsewhere. Just then Steely feels the vibration of an incoming message.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Unknown contact:  ‘Chase the rabbit three ways down, a ways to go.’
Steely:  ‘Who’s there?’
     Unknown contact:  ‘Do you have time?’

Steely’s baffled by the text but doesn’t have time to dwell on it, he starts the car and begins looking for another spot to park it, far enough from the original spot so as not to be noticed but still within the same parking structure. The perfect spot is three levels down. He carefully exits the car, makes his way into a common walkway towards a lift, gets inside though it’s crammed with people, and squeezes in amongst the plain-clothed engineers and corp. Employees all talking in code and oblivious to Steely.

Elevator doors open. Above ground it’s raining. Everyone braces for the rain as they exit. Steely puts his hood on and walks into an overpass. Billboards tower above it showing blue skies, a beach scene and a slogan that reads: “It’s June in Miami”. The rain continues pouring down, he’s still in the thick of the crowd. Steely exits down a ramp, jumps over a shallow ledge, walks under an overpass – there’s traffic speeding past him blurred – and begins to wait. Matthew pulls his car over, shining his lights on Steely. Steely gets into the car and steals the cigarette Matthew just lit from his mouth. Cars speed past going under and over intersections. A song played.

Steely and Matthew split up in a corridor and go into different classrooms that are stand-alone trailers.

In one class, a smooth but occasionally glitchy 3-D projection of a teacher greets Steely. The teacher is severe in appearance and manner. Though her projection corresponds to a live human being somewhere else on the planet, she might as well be a robot or at least the ghost of a human once capable of warm emotion.

     Teacher: 'Punctuality appears to be your Achilles' heel, Mr. Grude. Alas, you've cleared H3, admirable. Quiet your ears, then solve the riddle.'

The teacher trails away.

Steely exhales loudly. Takes his bag off and hangs it on a hook. There is a digital 24-hour clock in the top left corner, it's black steel with white numbers. The walls are covered in floral wallpaper, overhead there's a clear paneled mechanical ceiling. The mahogany floors ramp up to class seating, with curves and layers dynamically represented. A wall for projection wrapped in a semi circle lies at the head of the class.

Steely breathes in deeply, dropping his shoulders. The room is so quiet. He closes his eyes. A montage flashing in his head: Shoobie's mouth, himself as a small boy calling up from a pit, fencing, climbing a fence, running. A small quiet click comes into his ears from a clock. The memory of his father first forgetting while giving a lecture at his school. The silence. The stutter. The angry burst at someone touching his arm. He remembers his father not remembering him. His mother throwing things out of focus. The canopied street. The first car he stole on a spinning platter. His father's car.

Steely is mumbling a mantra and slowly his memories whitewash away. He opens his eyes and he is seated on a chair in full lotus. He breaks position and pulls a tray out of a side compartment and now he has a surface with a bowl in its center, a few gauges and a small loupe. It's what seems to be a mini solar system that he's manipulating with the gauges.

The teacher swarms back in and places a decades-old transparency paper on a projector.

The riddle:

     Teacher: 'You poured it hot and you're stirring it up, now what's moving faster, the tea or the cup?'
     Steely: 'The tea.'
     Teacher: What's harder Mr. Grude, a liquid or a solid?'
     Steely: 'Shit'
     Teacher: 'Of course. And what does your understanding of physics inform you of as it relates to softness and hardness of matter, Mr. Grude?'
     Steely: 'That, from a sub-atomic perspective, my shit is composed of particles mostly vibrating at a higher rate than my piss.'
     Teacher: 'Thank you, Mr. Grude. Your deft articulation leaves little to the imagination.'
     Steely: 'You don't have an imagination.'
     Teacher: 'Well, congratulations Mr. Grude. It has been my pleasure watering yours.'
The teacher swarms off. A status bar appears on the projection wall as if loading something. When full, a dozen other desks appear next to Steely each with a student projection seated in them, creating trails with their movements. These projections seem almost real. Unlike the microcosm whose projections are light based, the students' apparitions are hard particle nano projections whose touch have a light weight, thus they can interact with the physical world on a low level. The teacher re-materializes.

     Teacher: 'Grad students, the last movie of your lives here. "Giant"—1956. Enjoy.'

Steely looks down at his desk. His microcosm is developing well, thriving. There are 64 life harboring planets in his system. He looks through his scope. He monitors his gauges, adjusting tension and gravity here and there.

Steely receives a tummy rub via instant messaging from Shoobie, and a pouty face. He replies with a blush face. The movie plays and a couple of the students are watching. The class is 50/50 male to female. A swirl of different races and creeds. Someone's nose starts bleeding. A Japanese student crinkles plastic in a Russian girl's ear to annoy her. Two students are reading palms. Steely extends his hand, taps a blue eyed Korean kid named Kio.

     Steely: 'Howdy'
     Kio: 'Listen. It's out of control. My parents are hiring a load of lifeguards for this weekend. Apparently someone drowned last year at the pool party I've never had. Been on my Kegel exercises since last week.

(Kio's projection spreads hair on Steely's scalp with his swarm fingers and examines it before Steely shakes him away)

     Kio: 'Your hair is so clean?'
     Steely: 'Kio—get off.' (Doesn't move. Focuses his sight through the scope down into the microcosm.)
     Kio: (Speaking out loud) 'Western hygiene has lacked as fuck—these guys look dank.'
     Blonde Girl: 'Close your mouth!'
     Kio: 'Only if you keep yours open.'
     Blonde Girl: You're small.'
     Kio: 'She didn't talk to me like this last night. I'm so confused. This sucks.'
     Blonde Girl: 'Do you know I can hear you? What was last night? I'm in Morocco.'
     Kio: 'Last night, last month—whenever this loud sex was. I forget.' (Kio turns his head and is punched in the nose by Blonde's swarm hand.)
     Blonde Girl: (Warns) 'You are a small feeling. Do not!'

The downpour outside intensifies.
     Steely: 'She didn't like that one, Kio.'
     Kio: 'Bro, whatever, she's a lunatic, and she just got herself un-invited.'
     Steely: (Laughs and shakes his head.)

Dree, the Pacific islander student, taps Steely.

     Steely: 'That's TWO cartridges.'
     Dree: (Says 'okay' without saying anything.)

It thunders soon after a grand flash of lightning. Rain comes down heavier and heavier, then a black out.

The 3-D swarms of students and teacher disappear and the room goes dark. The glow of Steely's experiment is the only light source in the room. His gaze stays stuck on the system, its glow upon his face. Just then a message notice activates.

GROUP TEXT:

     Matthew: 'Anybody seen Robb? I think we lost Robb black ass.'
     Robb: A piece of me with always be inside of you.'
     Shoobie: 'lol' (emoticon)

Steely gets up from his desk, pulls his hoody over hid head and goes to use the urinals outside in the storm.

It's pouring as he walks toward a small shallow tower of urinals—they resemble a merry-go-round. He pisses with the rain falling on him hard. No one is outside. He washes his hands on a faucet above the urinal then heads back toward his class. Sunlight cuts through the rain. He gets back to his seat, soaked, and sits down in the naturally lit room. He looks down at his bowl for a moment, lights a cigarette and stares at it for a moment. Spinning it around and staring at the ember trails. The sunlight creates streaks across the classroom through the ceiling. He pushes everything back into a single point then folds the desktop back into the compartment.

Steely's eyes well up.

Steely's eyes are watering from the wind rushing in his face as he's smiling, then laughing, going full throttle on a speedboat with Shoobie, Matthew, Clark, Danny, Grad Girl #1, Rob, Grad Girl #2 and Grad Girl #3 in tow.

     Matthew (to Shoobie): 'So how'd you shut the power off? Generators didn't even come back.'
     Shoobie: 'No—I had a finals presentation.'
     Clark: 'Thought you handled your finals midterm'
     Shoobie: 'Extra credit.'
     Matthew: 'What are you?'

(Bonfire being set aflame on the beach)

     Robb: 'They're gonna shut that down any moment now'
     Grad Girl #1: (Eyes Robb while he takes off his clothes and puts on his wet suit.)
     Robb: 'Yea. I'm tryna get fit. So what. Swim.'

Robb pulls Junior girl #1 back into the water while the boat moves at a slower speed. Underwater shot shows Robb on a wake board being pulled by an aluminum speedboat. We see the turns and the flips and the fun.

     Matthew: 'I'm Shamu!' (Heard from underwater.)

Junior girls push Matthew and Danny. All fall in.

Sun going down—having brews—group talk.

     Robb: 'Always thought he had the better things.'
     Matthew: 'Kinda did.'
     Steely: 'Better looking staff, and the crazier grounds.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'I heard you have a woman in your shower who washes your back.'
     Steely: 'She's not a real woman.'
     Danny: (to Shoobie) 'When do you have to be over there? I heard that building is nuke-proof.'
     Shoobie: 'Yeah aren't they all now.'
     Danny: 'That's Central for you. Jesus.'
     Robb: 'You're not moving because of all this rain?' (Laughs)
     Shoobie: I've got all summer. The world's small. Day trips.'
     Steely: ‘Whole crew’s going different ways now.'
     Grad Girl #2: 'I'm taking over my parents' machine.'
     Grad Girl #3: 'You mean your parents' money.'
     Matthew: 'That's one thing that brings us all together, our parents' cash.. You too, my dear mid-caste offspring. Even you.'
     Shoobie: 'That's not what brings us together. But look, nepotism aside, I think you've done well for an underdeveloped intellect.'
     Matthew: (Grins in agreement) I would've quit this head job at first chance to climb locals and surf my life away. But the trust says I can't participate without taking my part in this ceremony.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'All I care about is world peace. All they taught me here was how to take notes.'
     Robb: 'OK, Miss Argentina.'
     Clark: 'I quite liked it here.'
     Steely: 'So that's why you didn't clear?'
     Clark: I cleeeaared.'
     Clark:Hey guys, listen. Alright, so. If I'm not fucking this person in person, but we get off to each other through the mesh all the time is it the same? Or am I trying to sell myself something? I asked em to take a job as my massage therapist to like simulate intimacy. Thought it was a long shot, but it worked out. It's been beautiful.'
     Shoobie: 'Who are we talking about?'
     Clark: 'That doesn't matter'
     Matthew: 'Is this person local?'
     Clark: 'Nah, isn't. It really doesn't matter guys.'
     Matthew: 'I think it's brilliant. Sounds perfect. Nothing left to be desired from my vantage point.'
     Danny: 'Hmm, I think it's nearly there. There's something missing that you might want—then again you might not want that at all.'
     Clark: Yea. It won't ever be like that.'

Steely drifts off imagining a frozen lake with another lake shining like stardust on its surface, the lakes reflecting a seamless white sky. White water.

Dream interrupted—RENNN RENNN RENNN!!! SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. An aluminum catamaran cuts through the water. Campus pull up on boats. Steely pours his beer out. Everyone hides their drinks. Water turns color.

     Campus Police: 'Please dock all watercraft and exit campus beach immediately.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'It's drop day! (Yelling at the police boat.)
     Campus Police: 'Please dock all watercraft and exit campus beach immediately.'

Campus Police speed away back to the shore. Students throw bottles at the police boat. Rather than head back to the shore and wait for the police, Steely pulls away in a different direction. The Police re-engage and give chase. Steely beaches the boat by sliding onto a black sand beach. All the students jump off the speedboat and run up the incline making an escape with the rest of the party.

     Steely: (Across the crowd to Shoobie) 'Meet at mine.'



Steely walks up to the parking structure of the corporate campus where Garten's car is located. Florence is manning the security desk. Looks on at Steely knowingly. This is one of Florence's gigs.

     Florence: 'C'mon.'
     Florence: 'Don't get yourself into anything you can't get out of child.'
     Florence: 'Gimme.' (Pointing at the bulge in his pocket.)

Walks past security into the empty underworld of parking levels—few overnighted vehicles here and there. He goes to where he left Garten's car and gets in. He pulls out a box of smokes and reads the warning label. He smokes a cigarette and begins looking at his teeth in the mirror. Garten's keys are inside as before. He starts the car. He drives normally, calmly, making his way off the corporate campus onto the highway, and getting off at an exit leading to a neighborhood nestled by woods. There is a subdivision ahead of him comprised mostly of high-rises. There's a lake passed.

Cut to Steely inside of a wide industrial lift. Steely's still inside the car, smoking another cigarette as the lift moves upward. Garten's car comes up through the floor, facing Shoobie. There's reflection on the glass behind her, faint speckles of light imply a city view in the distance. Shoobie's seated in a white swivel chair with large perforations. Wide white flooring with a desk complex. Neutral furniture. Fluorescent lights overhead in rails—glass all around. A potted plant caged with a bird. Shoobie sits there in the nude anticipating a party but covers herself once she sees the car. In disbelief she walks toward Steely but continues past him, covering her mouth as she stares at the vehicle.

Steely walks down a ramp into a living space, a bar that looks off into the distance. Outdoorsman photography and console portraits line a wall. A photo of Steely and his dad holding a catch by the sea, another of him climbing a half dome. There's a jellyfish aquarium. The seating area is an ecosystem all its own with more plants and contained living micro systems. He eats pasta and watches television. Once he finishes eating he gets up, undresses, grabs his recall device and heads to the bathroom. Steely walks into a yellow shower. A 3-D projection of a woman in blue washes his back.

Dunk. Break for the curb. Clark taps Steely on the ass, blows him a kiss. Clark shoves him. Steely stumbles and walks over to a vehicle parked on the side. Steely leans on the driver window and kisses the driver. Steely circles to the other side and sits in the passenger seat. Driver puts a dutch to Steely's mouth. Steely hits it. Steely and driver kiss blowing smoke out of their noses.

     Driver (Shoobie): 'Relaxxx...'
     Steely: (Shakes head) 'Awe man—don't do that—I don't even know how it started.' (leans in to kiss her again)
     Shoobie: 'Nope.'
     Steely: (Kisses her face still) 'What you do all day anyway? When'd you even get here?'

Shoobie ignores him, and changes a song on the playlist (she was his ride there in the first place). Steely crawls out of passenger window and talks over the car.

     Steely: 'So what's good for later? I need to shower.'

Matthew and Clark walk over to the car—Danny goes inside to shower.

     Clark: W'sup Shoobie.' (Kisses her on the cheek.)
     Clark: 'So you gon' draw my blood and I can't hit the blunt? You cold.'

Shoobie passes it to Clark.

     Steely: 'Imma be back later I left some shit in your house.'
     Matthew: 'What is it? I'll grab it for you now. You ain't comin' back. Y'all are about to get weird.'
     Steely: 'What an angel—but naw, imma come back though.'
     Matthew: 'Smiley faces...'
Wide road. Canopy of live oak trees and filtered sunlight. Low radio. Engine noise layered with shower scene. Engine noise. Love scene. Engine noise. Cut to black.

Steely is high off endorphins while his back is being rubbed by the lady in blue. He finishes his shower, heads to his bed and crash into sleep. Steely's blurry eyes open up to Shoobie lying next to him with the look of Christmas morning on her face. It's 5am-ish. The glass now gives the views pass up on the level. Shoobie has been dealing with Garten's vehicle for the last several hours.

     Shoobie: 'The majority of Garten's designs contain two access points. It's a motif of his.' 'This design in particular has nearly complete function solely from one key point. The second key point is hidden. I got its location off this thing's own thoughts. Whatever, take a seat.' (Pointing to the car)

Steely takes a seat. Black cup of coffee in his hand. Shoobie has a rainbow coil of wires running from a handheld device into a port on the headlight of Garten's car.

     Shoobie: 'Wait for it.' (As she works)

In a moment Steely's vision through the windshield glows and the city past the woods falls off into sky. His entire surroundings glow golden and white and the edges of his view fall off into endless sky. He seems to be on an island, floating high above any water. Steely jumps a bit, spills the coffee on his boxer shorts. It takes a moment for him to feel the sensation.

     Steely: 'Fuuuck....'

Steely jumps out of the car. Pulling off his burning shorts, eyes affixed to the fantastic view, which is fading back into reality all around him. His vision goes back to normal again. Shoobie smiles. Steely starts to wring out his shorts when he gets a new message notification.

     

[Verse 1]
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight
But I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards

[Chorus]
You're my golden girl
You're the one i've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey

[Verse 2]
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night
But I know I'm not going back home
I'm not going back home, no
[Chorus]
You're my golden girl
You're the one i've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (girl)
But the sky's never grey (never grey)

If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes)
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
I'mma stay right here, with you
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
Til the hurricane comes...

[Chorus]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k (girl)
But the sky's never grey (never grey)

[Outro]
Loving you, darling you
Won't be too easy
Thank god you seen me
I don't deserve a girl like you
I don't know what the hell to do
I just been quiet, here a few
Down on the bayou with the crew
With the crew...
With the crew...

[Verse 1]
Take my picture
Don't forget to frame it
Cause you'll miss me when I'm gone
I'll bet ya
You're gonna wanna hang it on the wall
Next to the door I walked out of

[Pre-Chorus]
(What now?)
That's the perfect spot for our love
(What now?)
Right by the door I walked out of
(What now?)
Just to remind you of what you lost
Everytime you walk out that door

[Chorus]
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
I'm good decoration

[Pre-Chorus]
The colors of your walls are depressing
The photo of me will brighten your place
You know it outta go
Right by the door that I walked out of
That's the perfect spot for our love
Right by the door I walked out of
Just to remind you of what you lost
Everytime you walk out that door

[Chorus]
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
I'm good decoration

[Verse 2]
Now you can fall in love with a picture of me
But it's not real
It's make believe
It'll be true
It'll never love you back like did
Back then

Ya Ya Ya

[Verse]
Here's to the good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
First time I'd ever saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
Here's when I realized you talk so much more than I do
Here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more than just some night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out

[Outro]
This nigga—all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you, nigga
He told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah—I ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that, my nigga, that shit... Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart
I don't even know how I feel about bi—

[Verse 1: Kent M$ney]
The same feelin' that you get when your troubles go away
I be giving you right here in a lyrical sort of way
It's my pleasure
Really you're all welcome
Couple taps on the chest for the niggas who all felt them
Live life nigga, that's what they all say
But you don't hear them ducking bullets in the hallway
Now that's life nigga
Open your eyes up
And stop frontin' on the team and disguise us
Fly music for all my people to ride to
Common rules and situations to grind through
Couple shots for niggas I never stuck with
A lot of praise for everybody I fucked with
Feelin' same reluctance towards them
I cause them
Everything but pain, they anticipating the reign of me
If you see it you can attain
But beware cause once you get it the feeling won't be the same, uh

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
It's only right
It's only right
It's only right, right, right (right)
They did me down bad but I'm good alright, right, right (right)
I swear this life is only meant for living high
I, I got to be right
I got to be right

[Verse 2: Kent M$ney]
Uh, you ain't believing a nigga
Why you coming around
What you perceive of a nigga, huh
Maybe cost a few diamonds bad bitches and a good time
I give these girls great dick and some good wine
You didn't get it when I said that I would do it
Tapping everything you feel
I've been through it, hurts don't it?
Throwing the worst on it
Feeling the curse so we smile for the moment
The pain, we postpone it
Hate niggas, it's a lot of those
Head of the class, the ain't shit honor role
You get a mouse and keys and a opinion
Snapping on the net, in person never offend them
Fall back you on that real life sucker shit
Bring it to my face if you a G, fuck a clique
And I ain't heated
Really homie? I'm chilling
I'm telling you the shit a nigga feeling, uh

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
It's only right
It's only right
It's only right, right, right
They did me down bad but I'm good alright, right, right (right)
I swear this life is only meant for living high (high)
I, I got to be right
I got to be right

[Verse 1]
Walked off the stage
In the middle of the show
I had to go, I had to see her, see her
I must be nuts, that's what they asked me
I may be, but oh I need her, need her
I need her yeah, she got my air
And I'm running, I'm running low
Where my driver go? Man I don't care
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone

[Hook]
And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in
I'm ready to breathe in that good air

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm burning out, I'm showing off
My heartbeat loud as my sixers, sixers
Guys pull me over and then they ask me
If I know I'm breaking the law
I said yeah she got my air
And I'm running, I'm running low
Where my driver go? Man I don't care
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone
[Hook]
And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in
I'm ready to breathe in that good air
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh

[Bridge]
On my way, I'm coming
Stick shift won't get in the groove but I'm coming
Traffic killing me, barely can groove but I coming, yeah I'm coming
Phone dead, can't talk to you right now
But I'm coming to get you, coming
I'm coming to get you, coming
I'm rushing cause I'm missing my boo, my my baby
You got what I what I, I, needed
Oh my baby

[Hook]
And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in
I'm ready to breathe in that good air
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh

Got the keys so we're gone, oh
[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh

Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm hitchhiking love
Could you take me to the hills
I'm not heavy no, I promise
I heard you could fly, could you try

[Pre-Chorus]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
I'm spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Verse 2]
Oh I really ought to ask
If I need a parachute or something
Cause if you take me way up there
I'll be scared to death of falling

[Pre-Chorus]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
I'm spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Every body knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Bridge]
Gravity's blowing up my phone, don't wanna answer
Them sidewalks calling to me (yeah)
Gravity's calling my phone, I can't answer
Ain't no service way up here girl
We're twenty-five thousand feet in the air baby
If love was sky, damn right I'm falling
Falling in love, but going up

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it, cause I see your wings
If that dress looks fabulous, don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Every body knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Outro]
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me what
Show me what
Show me what

{sounds n other stuff}

[Verse 1]
I hated every time we go out
Got everybody complementing you
You love attention from a big crowd
Feels like I'm on the sideline
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
Who's this other guy, that's sending you these flowers
Oh, now you tell me, that your ex is your best friend

[Hook]
Call me crazy
But all I want is you
To myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous
But I just call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

[Verse 2]
The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn't cause of me
Who else could it be?
And why when your with your friends it's always movie night or girl's night
It feels like I'm riding the bench
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
On the dance floor you're showing off your best moves
You've see my blown fuse, 'cause everybody's on you

[Hook]
Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

[Bridge]
The only thing I wish is all that's in your heart
Though it seems like I'm nagging, oh
Is wanting only me too much to ask?

[Hook]
When all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love


[Verse 1]
Maybe I should just be clear
It sucks not having you here
There ain’t a better way to say
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear
Like a bottle of Evian, you can see through me
My ego ain’t here

[Pre-Chorus]
So many clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

[Verse 2]
I try to go some months without a call
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all
Maybe I could find something in the club
Or something in the mall, mall, mall
But them girls didn’t matter
And this money ain’t distracting me much at all
[Pre-Chorus]
I know some clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you

[Bridge]
Girl I wanted to cry
But I made it look easy (it ain’t easy)
To hold it in and save face
And it was harder to stay
So I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To just get up and walk away
Now I’m alone and the tears do fall
Open my mouth and the words do fall
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

(ey, ey, ye eye, ey ey) x3

In flames

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
I ain't been home in a week
Barely been to Pasadena since them San Fran streets
I stay the night at the studio, I get no sleep
My passion for this music yo, it's far too deep
I rest for 3 hours a day, 4 and an half if I'm lucky
4:45 in the mornin' and I'm the only one up, see
I'm all about the hustle, Hodgy 'bout his grind
And you'll no longer struggle once you make up your mind
I had made up my mind and now I'm takin' the time
Steady niggas takin' from mines, I record in outer space
Bendin' time, lendin' rhymes, not a hand
Mixtapes to a fan, giving and gettin' grams
Odd Future shinin', S.P.F. sunscreen
Needs to be applied to burn from sunbeams
Teach a lesson if haven't learned from one's schemes
Mankind wouldn't be realistic if no one dreamed, yeah

[Chorus: Frank Ocean, Hodgy & Frank Ocean]
I got, I got anime on the screen
I got, I got pen in hand, scripting dreams
I got, I got — rich man said to me
"Just remember one thing: you'll never have time," time
You'll never have time, time
You'll never have time, time
You'll never have time, time
[Verse 2: Hodgy]
I knew it, mama, I knew it
One wish every birthday candle before I blew it
Son carved the paths out but I drew it, sicker than the flu
I'm on my stew shit, just let it simmer and brew
When I'm remembering you
We fall out in the winter
September, October, Novembering you
No contender with you, I'm like tendering food
Zip-Lock marinated, cook it if you care to take it
The time now to bake it, mama, show me how you make it
Bring me to life with an icing covered knife
Single handedly raised us, sacrifice and had to fight
For pay just to raise us, love is what made us today
Trust, we always got steel
I'll proceed to protect if I'm goin', shot, kill
I'm the star, twinkle, twinkle
Thanks for every birthday, you lit candles for cake, sprinkles, uh

[Chorus: Frank Ocean, Hodgy & Frank Ocean]
I got, I got anime on the screen
I got, I got pen in hand, scripting dreams
I got, I got — rich man said to me
"Just remember one thing: you'll never have time," time
You'll never have time, time
You'll never have time, time
You'll never have time, time
[Interlude: Left Brain]
Yo, yo, what the fuck is an interlude, anyway?
What the fuck is an interlude for, man?
What the hell do you need a fuckin' interlude for, man?
Fuck that, just play the next song[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
My flag is American, but I love some Queen
I'm young enough to vote, and toke the trees
I'll be playing concerts in the mud, until the sequel
I'll be finding subjects to paint in the buff, behind the easel
Tryna fuck, I'm a bad boy
I'm a punk, I'm a black man, I could dunk

[Pre-Hook]
And I'm hanging low, and I'm swinging far
Home, home

[Hook]
What you say
You need a hero
Heard 'em say
You need a save, hey

[Verse 2]
How high, tell me how high shall we jump
How far, really how far have we come
I've been wondering if we'd be better off without it
I was wondering were we better off before

[Outro]
Who needs you?, Who needs you?
Who loves you? Who doesn't?
What you say
You need a save, hey

[Verse 1]
Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self contained and aware
Of each other's forms
Still and in full strides just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

[Refrain]
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around the Higgs

[Verse 2]
What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video; only difference is, it's flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone
[Bridge]
I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you've showed
What you give, my words can’t hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours

[Outro]
Turn back, turn back
Turn back, turn
Back, turn back, turn
If you've never been in love
[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Gorgeous, chrome-plated horse whip
Home, making paintings for poor-quality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy
Sack swinging like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good Lord, walk light like the floor slick
Look bored, hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion, endorsing his own importance
Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating crisp spit
Fist clenched, emulating '68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle-age and limp-stick
Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliff's lit
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium
Heavy as insurance off a spanking new laser gun
Crazy heart, hazy lung, making art, raking funds
Crowd going dumb like Palin's son, ugh

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
And it always follows autumn
No home for the weak
No insurance for your pride
Jive
Jive
And it always follows autumn
[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I sit in thought 'til the flow is right
Then throw some D onto all available open mics
Smoke it right, proposing these niggas over
Wipe more because I normally toilet-bowl with a broken pipe
Shhh... The former soloist who flow was sick
The token sober kid stressed, so the role was switched
Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff
And who was useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit
Nigga, cold is what you need to keep the poultry in
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks
Early Man, you posers know me as the troll
Throwing moldy donut holes at your grody ho
From his cronies' whip
Eating like the kids when you take ‘em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over tacks
Damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is
Missiles to the picket fence
Who spit as good as finger-lickin’, bitch?
Bet it's 36 fish netted like the hook was inefficient

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
And it always follows autumn
No home for the weak
No insurance for your pride
Jive
Jive
And it always follows autumn

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, my
Oh, yeah yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, love, love, love
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Hollywood, Hollywood
Heard you like to take the love
That’s why I came to town
With only my brain
Holly baby
Baby, yeah, baby, yeah
Why do you drive the talent crazy, crazy
Yeah

[Chorus]
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
And they come from far away to meet ya'
Then you break their hearts in pieces
They call you home
Their home, their home
Yeah, yeah
And you drive them crazy
Holly baby, Holly baby, Hollywood, oh
[Verse 2]
I met you on the TV screen
You told me you were single, and
We talked about the weather babe
You said it never rains in southern Cali
Baby, baby
Why do you drive the talent crazy
Yeah, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
And they come from far away to meet ya
Then you break their hearts in pieces
They call you home
Their home, their home, yeah, yeah
And you drive them crazy
Holly baby, Holly baby, Hollywood
Oh yeahFrank: Aite so, Imma have my Red Bull. This ain't really relaxing, but okay. So, umm first of all, thank you for your time, BasedGod.

BasedGod: Mr. Ocean, yes sir, thank you.

Frank: You never know what someone's going through they say. What would you say the average commenter looks like on the internet? Let's say you put out a song in like two hours and you go on a blog and there's a hundred comments already... I'm tryna understand what that person is, who is it? Is it everyone around me secretly? I don't know that I know any of them. (Laughter)

BasedGod: When it comes down, it's like, who?? And I wonder that too. I can speak from personal experience, one of my people that I know, he had a video on Worldstar and I wrote some comments and I hated!

Frank: So it was you?! (Laughter) Alrite fsho.

BasedGod: So if you have some comments and they might be a lil personal, it might be your friend.

Frank: So these people are playing, it's just something to do. Not serious.

BasedGod: The scary thing is that some of these people are serious. (Laughter) that's what's scary. The comments give people the chance to say something anonymously, to put whatever they want, frustrations, anything. They could've come back from a long day and just wanna let loose on somebody. This is a real experiment, and it shows you how people are. I know you've heard about the experiment where they test people to see if they would beat up someone who's in jail, and they see if the people would shock someone else if they had the chance and the other person wouldn't know. People were actually shocking other people if they did something wrong, because you didn't see them. They would shock them, but if you could see them, then they weren't doing that. It's a scary thing when you feel like you don't have to see anybody or you have these layers of protection.

Mikey: It's a scary thing.

Frank: That's the real them. That's the real person. At the same time though, people are complicated to the point that nobody is any one thing. Given the opportunity you could be five different Brandons and I could be five different versions of myself—or more. Five is an arbitrary number. The internet is just another experiment showing us more sides of us.

BasedGod: You'll see some girl in the street who's really nice but on the internet is hating. (Laughter)

Frank: Okay, so we were talking about putting out music and I was saying your approach to it is modern. You aren't pinned down by the house rules or...

BasedGod: The norm.
Frank: That corporate America music shit, you know? I feel like the 'Based Way' is a lot healthier, because it's in a flow, unencumbered. To be able to take time and prepare a body of work is great, but overall being free-form with our output is better in the long run, I think. I'd like to be like that.

BasedGod: Congratulations.

Frank: Huh? (Laughter) Thank you.

BasedGod: I come from the traditional sense of music and I did that and I do that, that's what I love doing. I love that. Getting in the studio like where we at right now and doing what we doing, this is what I love. This is legendary. Also I come from making music however it comes because you know it's motherfuckers that need the music because that's all they got and that's what they got. You know we not worried about if it's for club quality. We gon play that full blast in our car or full blast at the house, and shit the club gon play it too, eventually, you know what I'm saying? The hood parties you know, or the local, the local parties or the people gon fuck with you. You know the people gon make that. (Runner brings in a bottle of Johnnie Walker)

Frank: Aye! Thank you.

BasedGod: Shall I open this for you, sir?

Frank: There you go, corporate backing.

BasedGod: You know what I'm saying?! That's what that corporate backing will do forreal!

Frank: You know they'll have that ass on the Johnnie Walker advert.

BasedGod: You gotta put that away, look, if you got some stock in it I'm fuckn w you.

Frank: I don't even know if they did the IPO like that. Nah they over there in Scotland. They got the address on the box right here. We should go see em.

BasedGod: So, look you gotta tell me, cus you be saying words I don't even know. IPO, what does that mean?

Frank: IPO stands for Initial Public Offering, it's when a company makes their product available for trade on the stock market. When they 'go public' so to speak. This comes with letting people know your business, like you gotta tell your shareholders how you did that quarter of that year, you know? You've got people to answer to.
BasedGod: Like why that drop?! Your investment niggas might fake on you. OG like 'Oh, you dropped five percent... I'm leaving,' and you like 'I thought you fucked with me, I thoughtu was my patna?' he like, 'Hmm...'

Frank: It's true though, fiscal responsibility. You've got a board. You could get kicked off the board even if you started it!

BasedGod: That shit's crazy, bruh.

Mikey: They tried to get Bill Gates in trouble, because when he took Microsoft public he bought 35 percent of the shares. He wasn't supposed to do that. I think you're only supposed to be able to get a quarter.

Frank: He needed that.

BasedGod: That's bossed up. So what would be the motivation of making your stock public and then buying 35 percent of it, if you already own it?

Frank: I don't know. More money equals more control I guess.

BasedGod: I'm 'bout to force myself to start loving money.

Frank: I had a conversation recently and the question came up, is money sexy?

BasedGod: You a real one for that bruh, I never.

Frank: My first thing was, 'Yes, money's sexy as fuck.' and my friend's saying, 'Nah, money is gross, it changes hands, it's filthy. People wear it wrong etc.' And I was thinking, 'Sure.' but no, I don't agree with that.

Mikey: I don't either, money is the fuel for options.

BasedGod: I was waiting for that and we can't forget that my brother, we cannot forget. Me, my problem sometimes, you know we all artists in here, and sometimes I'll just be so into my art and just my brand and shit, so fulfilled off getting the art and doing what I do that you forget that you're running a business also. You've got operations and things to keep this business going and to do that you gotta have money, you gotta be making money. You know it costs money to be in this studio. And I'm not the guy that's always putting it on my fans like, 'Hey fuck with me on my Paypal.' putting it on twitter, you know, 'Help the boy!' But it's a blessing too, because when you believe in your brand and you stay solid through the hard days and the times where you might be like, 'I don't know what's goin on dude,' or 'I don't know what's gonna happen,' and people might be saying 'Aww, you fell off.' and shit like that, and you keep going, and you know, then that big paycheck comes out, and you be like, 'Damn!' or, you know, these companies or individuals might come support you. I've been blessed with that. With hard work and stuff, if you really care about what you're doing, people will pay for that and they gon pay that price. And the show money has been going up for me. It's hard because you don't wanna get complacent. You know, 50 grand shows 15,000 something like that, and you unsigned. And you know you gotta split some money up, get your team and business costs to make the show happen. And I'm paying taxes than a motherfucker.
Frank: We all paying em. Trust. (Laughter)

BasedGod: Yea we all are. You just don't wanna be complacent because at first I was just worrying about paying bills. And now bills are paid and motherfuckers is owning things and now it's the next level of career and worldwide.

Frank: Worldwide. Yes.

BasedGod: Yes sir. Pop. You know I feel like i'm embedded in pop culture right now on this level, and that's a blessing where and how far we've come from. A lot of the beautiful people holding me down too. And especially people like ya'll that's just taking ya'll position and not afraid to show love and when ya'll are like on top still show love to people. Because everybody won't do that. Everybody won't be like, 'We still fuck wit B'. I'm like that though, always, anybody that inspires me... I mean you see I followed a million something people by my hand. You know what I'm saying? So it's like niggas can reach me. I made sure. I followed a million (knocks on the table) this hand bruh, I gotta gold-plate it! This is a hand that's followed a million niggas and then wrote a lot. A motherfucker can come talk to me, and I made that so. Cus I'm paying homage too, so I put that out there—anybody can come talk. If you gotta problem or nigga it's real, come talk to me. That's how I feel sir.

Mikey: Influence, also a big marker of success. When you wear something and then hella people wear it you're successful.

BasedGod: Yes, sir. Bless you my love. And thank you. And that's what I've been too. I've been having to deal with that like it's crazy, because I've been so under a microscope it's like... like me, creating a lot of these ideas. And it hurts me as an individual artist, because you'll see people—and I understand this is life though too you know—but you'll see people like an idea that you might've been thinking years on with the music or a brand that you've worked on extremely hard like with the 'Thank you BasedGod' or something like that and then you see motherfuckers stealing shirts and using the brand and not licensing it and not coming to me directly and doing this, and you know, just messing up the brand... I've got trademarks and shit too, so I'm not just out, but I haven't put lawyers on niggas because I'm just seeing how people doing me. And you seeing how people doing me. And that's not right. For me, I don't remember listening to Lil Wayne and being like, 'Alrite imma make a fucking Wayne t-shirt then sell it.' I never been like that. Wayne can do that, I can't and then people got the nerve too. (Laughter)

Frank: They do, they've got the nerve. That's what Mikey's talking about, that's success. Even that, even in that negative, that's a positive. People bootlegging because it means something, it's valuable, on whichever level.

BasedGod: And if you ain't givin' it to em!

Frank: My last record, I didn't make a vinyl. But somebody did and sold a whole lot of vinyl. They had mp3s on it, not properly done at all. Still they'll win because there's a demand for it. That goes back to the business talk we were having about covering your ass. Make sure you can profit from it not just for the sake of profit, but so you can convert that energy to build up your next ideas.

BasedGod: That's truth, bruh.

Frank: Random, but sometimes I prefer my childhood over all this serious adulthood shit.

BasedGod: Hell yeah

Frank: Not saying I wish I was a kid again but...

BasedGod: Well, you know what's crazy? I wouldn't be mad to look like a kid and have the adult mind. You know what I'm sayin? Keep the youthful skin. But you know I love it. I love it. I've finally accepted becoming an adult and really feeling what it means to have knowledge from experience. And for a long time I was really being hard on me. 25 used to always be old to me.  I used to say 'When I'm 25...' and things like that. You know it finally got there, and I'm getting a little further away from the high school. I've been out of high school (counts) I gotta count on my hands!

Frank: Yea man, believe it.

Frank: What year did you write your first book?

BasedGod: I was 19 so that was—uh...

Mikey: 2009.

BasedGod: Yes sir. Good math. He getting that money. Niggas know, I need my assistant nigga. Nigga gotta count for me (Laughter)

Frank: You're an author though. Are you gonna write another one?

BasedGod: Yea, yes I am. I'm definitely—I already got the title.

Frank: You don't gotta give that up right now.

BasedGod: The next interview, when it's closer.

BasedGod: It's gonna be powerful, so I really wanna get back to writing that. Like I just been so excited about making music bruh and like all the shit that I got planned.

Frank: Yea. Are you doing any more lectures anytime soon?

BasedGod: Man, thank you. Well um...

Frank: That's very ahead by the way.

BasedGod: Thank you, I love you for that, thank you. It's the caliber of people that like Lil B, so it's dope people—people in the school system that are smart and that understand the art aspect of it like you said. The modern way I'm distributing art, that was a beautiful way that you worded that... and these people they're getting it, the future. It started at NYU, I got my email out online and the people hit me up and they inquired and every lecture situation was inquired. Like I said, I don't gotta booking agent or manager and stuff like that so I don't have people actively trying to book like, 'Hey, can we book Lil B.' So anybody that wants to book a show from me, they're contacting me personally by email. It started at NYU and that was a huge stepping stone and deep down inside I really felt really good.

Frank: Yea, it was awesome.

BasedGod: Thank you bruh. I'm sounding modest and cool right now, but deep down inside, yea like, especially the MIT one I was really happy, because for me coming up, dude and this is a real emotional thing too. It used to hurt my feelings when people called me stupid back then because I wasn't in school all the time. I was doing what I wanted to do. But I loved science, I loved history and I loved teachers. I can't say I loved all history, but I loved science, off top science, I loved that no matter what. But I also loved teachers that really loved to teach me. And I had a lot of problems early on because I wanted to be a star in the classroom. That's why it makes sense that I'm a rapper because I was always looking for attention. When I raised my hand I knew it was my time in class, you know what I'm saying? I was like, 'Ooh, I can make a joke right now, aww the whole class is looking. I can say something in front of the teacher.' So I was always that guy pulling the school bells and little things like that, getting my respect and freeing the kids. I was freeing all of us. Because I wasn't understanding the magnitude... and the beautiful magnitude, of education. But I did. But it was like when you're a kid, dude... nigga, they got you in there for hours and shit.

Frank: The whole fuckin day man. Missing the sunlight and everything in there (Laughter)

BasedGod: We was blessed cus we had the off campus lunch, so nigga I was gone. We had a chance to go and eat and leave school for lunch, bruh. And that was a blessing and it's a beautiful thing, because you always got to—it's all about the unconscious—unconsciously I always been doing this, however, whatever... it was always music near me. And it stayed to this day. My grades and shit wasn't reflecting how I felt inside, you know my grades if I would've went by grades, you know I... you know, right know I.... I knew. You know what I'm saying? And that's why I cry, you know? Like when I'm listening to my music or I cry for how where I'm at today. Because it's like by the standards I shouldn't be, by the standards... I should be working or something.

Mikey: That's beautiful.

BasedGod: God bless you man.

Mikey: That's like believing in yourself.

BasedGod: Yes sir and thank you. Yea, but back to the root, what was the root kinda. The root?

Frank: Nigga I forgot.

BasedGod: Yea I forgot too.

Frank: I don't know where I was reading it at, but the chain of command in your brain and how it's evolutionary... in the sense of you having a part of your brain that in the progress of human evolution was the first thing to be developed, the brain stem which is said to control involuntary function. Then you have the next level up, which is emotional and survival based, and then above that you have rationale, mathematics and creative writing—all the things we do for a living. That state of the art brain stuff. It was also talking about how it, let's say we were nomads again and we were out here hunting for a living and we were confronted in the woods by a predator, you'll be literally cut off from access to the higher levels. Your brain is designed to cut off reasoning and to go straight to the mode of survival so you don't waste precious time tryna delineate, you just go straight into survival—the real fucked-up part about it is rarely, if ever are we now encountering a bear, but you might encounter a scenario that's actually not life-threatening but that scares you enough to initiate that sort of response and go straight to this lesser developed part of the brain.

BasedGod: Nah, that's the truth. Quote unquote a man and being quote unquote a man and what that means in society and that's what's hard for us. I really wanna protect the women and protect the kids, make sure that ladies know that you can wear gym shorts and not or don't have to feel like you're forced to, because sometimes I wonder if these fashions, these styles that we think are normal are normal... we should be able to see people anyway they wanna be seen and not fantasize about them or fetishize how they look. So it's like, a girl, she might be hot and she has a bunch of hot pictures on Instagram, and I look and be like, 'Oh, she's hot.' and she might put a funny face picture up and I'm like, 'Ew,' like some weird, you know. Just being herself, you know how the girls be doing that just to do some shit and uhh, I had to look at myself and ask, 'What the hell is my problem?' she's human, we're human. Like, because I do the shit too. I put pictures up—and especially now—I'm more comfortable with myself than ever so. You'll put some shit up and it might be an angle or something you not gon try, you not gon take 15 pics. You gon take that one and just put that motherfucker up and let the world see you. We just gotta keep protecting the young me, the young women and also the older people. You can't forget about the older people too. And try to let them know. Just keep on moving these walls and barriers of what it means to be a man or a woman because that shit'll kill you too. If you really try to live by that, you know, being a masculine man like, 'Oh, I gotta protect my wife,' like 'I gotta go hunt for some food.' Why can't she hunt? Or not, and I'm not saying that and imma tell ya'll like this. I been punched by a girl. Girls done punched me. I'll never hit em and that's what's funny to me because you see I'm not the biggest guy and shit—that shit hurt. When the females hit me, that shit hurt. I never hit them back but all this law bullshit they talking about 'A girls. Don't hit girls and shit'... Well, you know what? I never hit a girl before, and they almost knock my ass out and I might have to hit em and sleep they ass because she almost knocked my ass out, so it's like, you know. And trust me I never hit a girl first, ever, ever, never. It was always a girl slapped me because we might be making fun of each other or something—my play sister she slapped the shit outta my ass for making fun of her. And another girl when I was at the club she slapped the shit outta my ass. I didn't know how the club rules worked (Laughter). I was at a strip club or whatever, and I was at the front part and she was dancing, and I wasn't paying I was just looking and I was with my friend, and I think it was my friend's birthday, I took him out on his birthday. This when I was younger I felt I was doing it big, rented the limo and everything, took him out, and man, she smack!

Frank: For not paying?

BasedGod: Yea, lip was bleeding and shit like that. And you know I acted like I was gonna do something, you know what I'm saying? Like I got up and 'Oh okay', and I picked up the chair, looking cool. Picked up the chair like I was gonna do something. And you know, deep down inside I didn't wanna do nothing. You know I wasn't gonna beat her up. But I still did something, I was like 'What?'. Security got my ass out fast than anything, so I really couldn't do nothing anyway.

Frank: I never heard of that. Yea, she was wildin. That's why you came out w the 'Stealing from Strippers' song? (Laughter)

BasedGod: Wildin, that was early. That's why people's wondering why I come out with the song. I got some shit that's gon come out sooner, and it's gonna be like, motherfuckers like, people are gonna be like 'Wow', you know, this 'Thugged Out, Pissed Off' gonna be talking about that, you know beating up bitches and things of that nature, because now to the outside people they might be like, 'Oh, this is horrible.' or misogynistic or whatever it is, but then once you talk to me... this guy never hit a woman but he's been attacked and what he's been through, and then you gotta be like, hmmm well, you know what? I'll speak on shit and then motherfuckers will hit me like, 'Well, you can't speak on shit because you've never been through it.' But you don't know, motherfuckers don't know. Niggas don't know what a motherfucker survived through.

Frank: Yea, true. You know, I've been thinking about something. I've been talking about moving to London since 2012. The only reason I bring that up is because I was always thinking man—this example is stupid, but today I was leaving the hotel, and I was at the elevator and something told me to go back to my room and get some Kleenex because I'm a lil sick and I'll be in the car sneezing and get snot all on my fuckin sleeves and be upset. (Laughter) It's a very simple thing to just go back to the room and get the Kleenex. Yes, I know, I'm already at the elevator, but it's a very simple thing to just turn around and go back to the hotel room get some Kleenex and head back down to the car. A lot of the times though, I'd say, 'Well, self, I'm already over here at this elevator, so im not finna do that.' Then the next thing I know, I'm in the car sneezing and I got snot all on my sleeves. I feel like we know what we're supposed to do, we've got the supreme wisdom. With the whole relocation to London thing, my mind was playing tricks on me. I started to think if I had moved when my intuition first told me to move... then certain shit wouldn't have happened. So now, I always go back to the hotel room. 

BasedGod: Okay, peep this: I was at Starbucks I was getting over this cold naturally I was drinking chamomile tea every day. I don't know what made me buy chamomile tea every day idk. I was like imma buy this everyday just getting over this cold. I was going through the drive thru every day and it was normal for me it became the normal thing so something told me to go inside Starbucks and something made me walk inside and I tried something new, I went and I said lemme try peppermint tea, which changed my life. Healed my cold asap. And I'm like why the fuck I was so stuck on drive thru chamomile tea, and something told me to try something new, and I did it and it felt amazing, and that was my new breakthrough, and when I did it a thought came to my head, and it was about manhood and lifehood and seeing how it's not easy for anybody, like our parents, because they were all our age and they all were just acquiring habits of living, and I was just trying to live when I was buying this chamomile tea every day, I'm like I'm livin, just surviving the day, we're not perfect. You know what I'm saying? So you know you'll give that game to your kids too, you might be drinking chamomile tea every day and if it works for you, you gon tell your son, 'Hey drink this every day. You can drink the chamomile too.' but it showed me when I took the other choice, make sure that you see other options and don't stay just on that one, you know what I'm saying? And don't stay so strict on that one.

Frank: That reminds me, there's an engineer named Jason I worked with on this album. He'll be eating barley you know, raw barley and he'll have the drops on hand to put in the water to make the ph balance and the minerals or whatever, and it occurred to me... see I have friends who are really curious and so whenever they're around new people they tend to ask a lot of questions and like really try and get to know people. As for me, I can be aloof. Not in any cold way I hope, let's say I'm big on giving people their space and not getting all in people's mix, and it just occurred to me recently that I should ask people more questions (Laughter) like 'Jason, when you're not at work what's your breakfast lunch and dinner game plan?' And then he'll say some shit that I didn't know, something I might wanna use for my daily lifestyle. Or what someone is reading, he reads a lot of artist biographies and I'd never asked him, 'Which autobiographies have you read?' like why have I never asked him that, I'm always reading and tryna learn from people who aren't right next to me. Discrimination based off proximity. (Laughter)

Mikey: You know it's a crazy wives' tale about how you wanna start moving on in your career and stuff, doing more and have some more sponsors and people were saying how it's hella easy, like usually you could ask me and you don't even know it. So there's an old wives' tale about diamond mining and this dude found this big old diamond and everybody gathers around him, and are like, 'What the hell? Where'd you find that?' 'It's a big nice diamond. I'm not telling you where I found this,' so everyone starts going to mountains, trees and they start doing crazy stuff, killing animals, opening their stomachs, when really diamonds are right here in the ground. It's crazy that thought sometimes that makes it go crazy.

BasedGod: Just those situations, you know, fuckin w anybody... not being scared to talk to people and ask, you know what I'm saying? Cus when I was overseas and in these other places you know Harlem—Harlem Netherlands or something like that—I was just walking in the shit because I'm foreign, and I didn't care, and it's cool, like a nigga would walk and out here and I have to remember that. Because I feel like there's so many barriers. Niggas was asking me to pull my pants up for so long so I always had these barriers. And I finally had to break the shit down, I'm not different. We're not different. No matter how motherfuckers might try to make you feel. You a legend bruh. You gotta realize I just got comfortable walking in random places, cus like I got money I could do what I want. Like in a way, to an extent, but like for the Base level, you know like niggas could go in anywhere and we could do, even to eat, just say, to eat. So my thing was I was so wrapped up in how I look or how I thought I looked but, nigga like, we should be able to go in any restaurant any place. I used to think and be so into my head and worry about what people thought about me and that used to hinder me. I used to not do as much as I could. Like my nigga why am I still eating fast food? I'm eating fruit all time now, you know it's beautiful, we got the fruit downstairs.

Frank: Yea you told me you went to Whole Foods before you came here. Said you were a lil late because you had to stop at the market and get those fruits and vegetables. (Laughter)

BasedGod: I got another one, here it goes, I ordered a sandwich. I was a little hungry and I automatically flipped on dude like before I even opened it. Like 'Why the fuck is this sandwich not cut?' I opened it a lil bit and it was cut. You just gotta wait sometimes. I tripped like, 'What the fuck. Niggas can't get shit right. This dude.' I just opened it a little bit just waited, wait. Not expecting the worse. And I'm just like 'Boom!'... I'm just a fucking ass

Frank: Dog, what? (Laughter)

Frank: I think we got it man. (Laughter)

BasedGod: This is so great. I'm so glad you made this happen bro.

BasedGod:This was a good one my brother.

Frank: Peace to the God. Thanks a lot. It was great to see you in the flesh.

BasedGod: You think I could take a picture of you bruh on the professional camera?

BasedGod: I'm on my Terry Richardson.home. i put my bag down. leave my shoes where they land. pull my shirt over my head. hang it on the ironing board. fall into this white nautica comforter my mom bought from marshall’s when she came in town to see me last. home is currently in beverly hills. a well executed renovation project not far from wilshire theatre. i like this place. rent’s two grand. expensive. refrigerator’s stainless. countertops are granite. living room floors are travertine. bedroom floors are hardwood. it’s a nice space. beige walls with nothing on them. but an ignorant television or two. a mural i did by hand when i was heartbroken and a completely arbitrary photo of odb in the bathroom above the toilet. my favorite piece. i got one closet and more articles of clothing than i need or wear. options are good. i’ve never been notably organized or tidy. so a large percentage of my wardrobe is usually strewn across my bed or that aforementioned ironing board. i keep my bathroom clean. kitchen too sort of. i eat out so much that the only issue i really have is perishables perishing in the icebox. oh and my fish died recently. i still haven’t emptied his tank. damn. a nice lady named mayra comes by a couple times a month and cleans up for me. it’s the best eighty dollars i spend everytime. i built out a project studio in my living room. the mess of wires is starting to become a nuisance though. i’ve probably recorded at home less times than i can count on my hands. i have made a couple beats though. beats which i’ve played for no one but frank. i’m reading three books at once. well not really. but you get it. which one i pick up at the end of my night sort of depends on my mood. i’m furthest along in the one about an african kid who moves to america after his family is killed and his country is destroyed by civil war. his story is hardly imaginable. i appreciate the relative calm in my life by the time i put it down. i used to be addicted to cnn. nowadays my tv is either off or being used as a monitor for my mac in the living room. except on sunday nights when entourage is in season. i read magazines a lot. they’re my favorite. i have no subscriptions. last time i counted i had near a thousand bucks worth of magazines stacked next to my sofa. newsstands must love me. i’m impulsive as fuck. damn. that’s bad. i’m gonna try and subscribe online somewhere or something. i’ve got a lot of music here too. lately i’ve been going to amoeba and buying oldies but goodies that i’d never heard before. i must admit those have been my most wise purchases this summer. smarter than my car note for sure. sade’s love deluxe might indirectly buy me a g550 one day. a house to park it in front of too probably. no bullshit. i’ll sleep now. maybe i won’t wake up till morning. maybe i’ll wake up shortly. either way i’ll pray. and i’ll dream.

[Verse]
Cityview turned to the mountain view
Find a place for a quiet one
Suburbia got a yard
All this estate for my mind to run
Run, run, run

[Verse 1]
What's the point of interacting?
If no one will talk to me?
And I'd rather have left be
And you all can go off with your money & weed

First let me find myself
So I can redefine myself
But I still might not come out
I'm not ready to shout

And be noticed
And make new moments
That I can cherish over
Being safe & sober

But if I put myself out
It might not be much
I won't lie
Like forever, I'd rather hide

[Chorus]
I can think better alone
Locked away in my home
I'm not respected either though
But I don't wanna if you should know

So goodbye for now
Maybe I'll wonder how
How I would've done without a frown
And instead with a crown

[Instrumental Change]

[Verse 2]
Stay away
I'm too afraid
To leave this cave
It's the only place

To stay away from doom
And nonstop gloom
And that cave is my bedroom
And no one better step a foot

[Chorus]
I can think better alone
Locked away in my home
I'm not respected either though
But I don't wanna if you should know



[Verse 1]
I got a question I wanna ask my momma
But she's been gone for some years now
I need the answers, I want to ask my friends
But they're to cool to be honest
And she's gone take it the wrong way if I question her
It just might break her heart, man
I can't ask my girl

[Hook]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie
And I'mma ask Prince
If I'm in love

Tell me, tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
Am I in love?

[Verse 2]
Who the hell knows who Purple Rain is?
And am I standing in it?
I sing along to every single word though
And I feel like I need them
'Cause for all I know
Rocket love flew past me yesterday
But I gotta know for sure

[Hook]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie
And I'mma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
Am I in love?

She gone!

Tired out my my my mind
Lost all my money and my time
I used to be the best, now I do not grind
Shawty where'd ya go

Tried to find ya
Tried to love ya
I miss ya food
When ya cook
Now you ain't never gonna, hear a reply again
She gone!

She gone forever
She was so flyy
Me and her
Her and I
Can I see you one more time
Before the day I die?
She asked me questions
I asked her "why?"
She said, "I love you"
No reply
I guess you can just spend it all on me
Me
But we could've been something special
Just know you always got a special place in my, in my, in my
I guess you can just spend it all on me
Me
But we could've been something special
Just know you always got a special place in my, in my, in my

I miss that life

Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you around

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
Why is that?

[Verse 1:]
One winter morning I went for a drive, I stopped somewhere between June & July
I love these warmer days
But maybe I can't see that the snow's still falling
I only see the gift my heart just brought me
(Merry Christmas babe) That's what she said
She didn't have to do much, but she made me smile
December in Manhattan feels like South Beach now
I love my baby, ohh yes I do

[Hook:]
It ain't about you givin' anything, as long as you're my everything
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been givin me
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right here if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)

[Verse 2:]
It's just a regular morning, I'm a regular guy
Takin' the train to my 9 to 9
(But something's different today)
I had an envelope sittin' right next to my breakfast
And it's from my baby, not the bill collectors
(Happy Birthday Babay)
Then it said... I know we don't got much but baby we got us
And after you get off, we gon' make sweet love
Now go and get that cake (ohhh yeah)
[Hook:]
It ain't about you givin' anything, as long as you're my everything
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been givin me
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right here if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)

[Verse 3:]
One day the whole world will hear me sing
Then I'mma run and buy you those things
But right now, three months pay barely gets me a diamnond baby
But one day I'mma buy you that ring
Ohhhh

[Hook:]
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right there if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)

(Nothing but everything)
(I don't need anything, long as you're my everythinng)

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Every girl that I met on tour
I knew none of them would last
Cause it wouldn’t work, nah it wouldn’t work
A hundred chick contacts in my phone
About half of them I smashed
I put in work, oh, I put in work
But there's something missin' there though
Feels like I've gotta lambo with no gas to go
And I've got all the world, nothing to show
That girl just let me know

[Hook]
I need love
Yeah, I need you, yeah, I need you
I need love
Yeah, I need you, oh I need
I need love in the morning
In the afternoon
I need love all night, all night
I need love, need love, need love, need love
Need love

[Verse 2]
Two weeks ago
I would've never admit I had it bad, oh
I wouldn't do it, nah, no
Cause fifteen days ago
Never knew you, so never knew how this felt
Had no clue, I was too cool
But now I can't go a day without ya'
I wake up eating breakfast thinking 'bout ya'
We'll go around the world, don't ever go
No, don't ever leave me 'lone

[Hook]
I need love
Yeah, I need you, yeah, I need you
I need love
Yeah, I need you, oh I need
I need love in the morning
In the afternoon
I need love all night, all night
I need love, need love, need love, need love
Need love

I wanna wake up from this dream
No sleep full of dreams, I'll stay
And I know it'll work girl
There's no where I'd rather be
Because I need

[Verse: Frank Ocean & Jazmine Sullivan]
I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need someone out there
But try to love the one you're with tonight
Try to love the one you're with
Tonight late at night sometimes it helps
If you don't have to be all by yourself
In a moment life could end
And this could all be over with
I know you're in here somewhere
You came out alone
Something you need
It's been so long
Gotta find the one
Who'll hold you tight

[Verse]
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket
[Bridge]
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
You make me violent

[Outro]
My room, my room, my room with me
Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress

My room, my room, my room with me
Every night you were in my room

I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air

[Verse 2: BennY RevivaL]
Uhh, uh, what
I gotta leave you be, every night you iggin' me
Boy, baby, get your life right, baby, message me
And I hit you back, fast, Mackin', like in Tennessee
Off in my room, doin' what I ain't supposed to be
Wet sheets my sex be, I speak so messy
Babe pass me that death tree and let me smoke please
At night you be in my room, don't care what city
You dyin' to catch my seed, take off and reunite
Don't freak like you desperate, shout out your exes
They dealt with your selfish type of aggression
I beat then I flexed it, that's my confession
I skeet just to exit off to your best friend
Don't take this hard, me pretty boy, how I exit
You dread a thought, I made your heart an investment
We creep 'cause you pressed it, that ass a weapon
No sleep on that bed spread, you get this message
Now go on

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

What’s your name?

What do you do?

Do you want to do anything else, and if so what is it?

What’s your first memory?

What’s the most amazing thing you’ve ever witnessed?

What’s the best thing about being you?
What’s the worst?

If you could switch bodies with someone for 24 hours, who would it be?

What three superpowers do you wish you had?

What is life going to look like in the year 3000?

How far is a light year?

What have you been listening to lately?
Do you have any secret talents?

What would you do on your last day on Earth?


[Page 57: Boys Don’t Cry]

Ryan

I play Soccer, I go to school

I wanna be better a skating

The first word I learned to say, or that I’ve ever said was dog

Whеn I went to London I saw this tight building, I was pretty high, it was tight

6. N/A

Probably my brother, just to see how much work hе has in one day, just to be in the life of him

I want to be invisible, I want to fly and I want to be invincible

Probably gonna be like flying cars and stuff, it’s gonna be a whole electronic world, absolutely no trees, or the world will be done

Forever
I’ve been listening to BasedGod, my brother and I’ve been starting to listen to Mac Miller’s music and a little bit of Eminem and that’s it

Well, not really, I’m an open book

Everything that was on the bucket list, like I don’t know, there would just be a lot of things I’ll do, probably spend a lot of time with my family and tell them I’m going away and probably… I don’t know. There’s a lot of things you could do


[Page 58: Boys Don’t Cry]

Sage Elsesser

I make love and I skateboard

Make art, paint pictures

Eating chicken and rice

Oh, when ah, some nigga got stabbed by some Mexicans with a machete in front of McDonald’s near Thebe’s house. (Did he die?) I think so, they ran inside, but some nigga spit at a car with some Mexicans that were gardeners, and they hopped out with the machetes, and… it’s a wild story, yea

I don’t know, I got bushy eyebrows
Having bushy eyebrows, being Drake

Probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome. No, actually no, fuck him, probably Dill, ‘cause he doesn’t have to do anything at all but sit in his house

I wish I could fly, I wish I could be a jumper like go place to place. I also wish I could die whenever I wanted and then come back to life and see who gave a fuck when I die
I don’t know, I’m gonna be dead, so I won’t know what it’ll look like

It’s very far, yea, it’s very fucking far

Jessica Cleaves, Friends of Distinction, Brenda and the Tabulations, that’s it

I make music, I can draw, paint…

Skydrive


[Page 59: Boys Don’t Cry]

Nakel Smith

Skateboard, and other things

Design stuff, just everything, like shoes and skateboards, wheels, Chucks, houses and dressers

Falling off a balcony

Friendship, and how it controls the world

Best thing about being me is that I got a nice set of friends. I got a clear mind, I think, sometimes. The worst thing about being me is I think a lot too much, sometimes I’m very musty

One day? I don’t know, wow

I wish I could fly. I wish I could teleport and I wish I could go invisible

3000? It might look the same, it might look terrible, everything could be demolished, and the whole world could be over, or it could be great and shit can fly and buildings would be very very tall, and everybody won’t know what the ground looks like

Damn, I don’t know

Sabbath, Chief Keef, umm hold up, I’ve been listening to Isaac Hayes, and The BasedGod

I don’t think so, I’m pretty open with everything I do

Spend a couple hours with my family and then I’ll go out and just do everything that I ever thought about trying, ever, like no matter what it is, if I ever had the thought I would actually go out and try it


[Page 60: Boys Don’t Cry]

Branim Iriri

I skate and I work at Active

I want to accomplish a lot of goals in life, hopefully be like a movie director or something— something cool, I don’t know… like a scorer or a composer, or a designer, clothing designer in the skateboarding industry hopefully

I don’t even know, to be honest

Ahh shit, that’s a tough one. The most amazing thing I’ve ever witnessed? That’s tough, what would you say to that? I don’t know, shit, uh, fuck, ok something short and simple: I saw Kanye last month, that was probably the greatest thing that happened this year as far as I can remember

The best that about being me is that I just don’t give a fuck. Can I curse? Yea, I just don’t care about shit, so like I don’t know, that just makes me happy and I don’t let shit bother me and I just try to be positive and just enjoy my fucking life, and the worse thing is, I don’t know, sometimes I feel like people don’t like me, but then I think I’m just trippin’, I don’t know

Probably like some kinda monk in like the forest up in China so I can like balance on my forehead or some crazy shit

I wish I could fly. I wish I was really strong and uh, shit, shit, I don’t know, to be able to shoot fire from my mouth or something

Probably a fucking apocalypse or some shit, I don’t know. Probably be like The Matrix, like robots and technology and all that shit

I don’t know

Toro y Moi, The Internet, and BasedGod, that’s about it

No

I’d take a piss in a fucking cop’s coffee mug

Evan Clark

I work on cars, hang out, umm, help friends work on cars and stuff

Continue to work on cars, drive cars, travel

Ever? In the hospital room getting a toy motorcycle from my mom as a present from my sister as her birthday present to me

Best thing about myself is I like to explore and get into things and try out new stuff. I think the worst thing is that sometimes it doesn’t work out— get into trouble, you know what I mean

Does it have to be a person? It’ll probably be a sloth, just kick it all day long

I wish I could fly. I wish I could swim deep to the bottom of the ocean, and I wish I could sleep, without like being dead, but forever at the same time

It’s gonna be so dirty, it’s gonna be filthy, too dirty

Like a trillion miles or something

The radio

I can stay asleep, so well

Probably jump off something really high, super high, try to land in like a handstand or somethingI ain't been getting high
Well, maybe a little, baby
I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me girl
I don't always reply
Well, you're not an angel either
You can't even fly

I notice
You think that you know shit
All this shade that's coming at me
I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision boy
They must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie
I wonder who wrote it, oh shit

I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever ever
Hold up, nevermind

I-I spy with my little eye
I spy-I spy with my little eye
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made
It usually doesn't rain in Southern California
Much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears
But boy they poor when

I'm thinkin bout you
No-no-no-no
I've been thinkin bout you
You know-know-know
I've been thinkin bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya

Or do ya not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin bout forever
Oh yeah
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin bout forever
Oh yeah

My mama called
Seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed
Ever since we was on
I dreamed it all
Ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin' say we changed
And look we made it
Yeah, we made it

I spy with my little eye
I spy-I spy with my little eye
Cause I've been thinkin bout you
You know-know-know
I've been thinking bout you
Now they always say congratulations

[Hook:]
Thought that I was dreamin'
When you said you loved me
Yes, it started from nothing
Had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
And it started from nothing
Oooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate you now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down, is good
You broke my heart last week
I'll probably feel better
But if we can still remember how you'd hold me
As you're screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good
It's all good, all good, all good
It's all good, all good
It's all good, all good, all good
It's all good, all good

[Verse 1:]
If I could see through walls
I could see you faking
If you could see my thoughts
You would see our faces
Safe in my rental
Like an armor truck
Nah, nah, we ain't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
I'll never be a kid again
We'd try to see if Heaven exists back then, back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Life was chill as fuck back then
We were friends...

[Hook:]



[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing, oh
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then
Back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming, oh
I could dream all night
Dream all
I could drive all night
Drive all
I could dream all night
Dream all
I could drive all night
Drive all

[Outro]
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming



[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces

It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

[Bridge]
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Outro]
All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to? Mean to
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin', dreaming

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could guess your password
You know I'd break in
To the empty heart
That you keep my face in
Deleted scenes where I took off my shirt back then
You couldn't take off work back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
I had a twin
Took out all the mids back then
Back then
No matter what I did
I couldn't fucking sing back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends
[Chorus]
I know that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the mall in the nighttime
You came back alone with the flashlight
Had to admit, I couldn't see it ending well back then
You were dressed to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids at all
It's not the same
Sasquatch is over
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good
[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
We could start again with nothing new
I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Outro]
All those things I didn't need to say
That I said to you
There were things you didn't need to say
That's okay too
Baby, I could dream all night, dream all night
I could dream all night, dream all night
DreamI thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
I had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'

I wish my new day job was you

[Pre-Chorus]
But they say my checks come from the bank
And not your heart (not your heart)
And not your heart
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
And not my heart
And not my heart

[Chorus]
But if my job was only to love you, yeah
There wouldn't be no recession
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression
If my job was only to love you, girl
There wouldn't be no stressin'
Be no stressin', ain't no pressure
'Cause it pays way better babe
It pays way better baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
My boss works my nerves, girl
If you knew him you'd wanna quit too
I just know he's jealous
Cause he's lonely and I've got you
(But what I'mma do)

[Pre-Chorus]
But they say my checks come from the bank
And not your heart (not your heart)
And not your heart
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
And not my heart
And not my heart

[Chorus]
But if my job was only to love you, yeah
There wouldn't be no recession
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression
If my job was only to love you, girl
There wouldn't be no stressin'
Be no stressin', ain't no pressure
Cause it pays way better babe
It pays way better baby, yeah

[Outro]
If I left this place today with the love that we made
I'd be paid for the rest of my life, rest of my life
I love you the rest of my life, oh
Be paid for the rest of my life
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh



saturday I'll wake up in central london
stretched out lil low on serotonin
cus last night was extra’d out
place both knees on the ground
then ask god what he's talking about
before i kiss him on the mouth
God himself breathed in and out
last night i had a dream
Gyllenhaal on a mountain top
holding on two stone tablets with ten commandments
and a flower crown power couple propaganda phamplet
black panther and white panther you could run the jungles sleeping free on the tree branches no light pollution
look how slow all the life is moving once you get your heart racing
today if i survive i'll let my feet leave the ground
levitations and revelations
take me up in your rapture now

[Verse 1]
Look up, look up, look up
You’ll see the lies flying in the air
Reach out, reach out
Try to catch one if you can

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, right now they’re flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It’ll be the worst surprise

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
Causing kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see 'em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming
[Verse 2]
Feels like I’m on the 30th floor
Staring out my window
See them, they about to crash
Right into you
You’re marching on the sidewalk
Umbrella up, oblivious
No clouds, shades on, no sun

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, right now they’re flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It’ll be the worst surprise

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see ‘em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming
[Bridge]
Look up, look up
You better look all around, all around
Baby you better
Look up, look up, I know
They’re coming down, coming down
They’re coming down
Look up, you better look up
Look up, look up, look up, look up

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see 'em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
Till you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming
[Outro]
Look up, look up
And baby you’ll see the light
You’ll see him flying
Look up, look up
You’ll see the lies
No, look up, look up
Flight 143 took off a minute ago
Flight 143 was just on the ground

[Intro]
Aye, listen
It's Lonny
Wait a sec
Okay, go

[Verse 1]
Hey let me tell you something
Don't be frontin' like he ever did it like I does it
Every time you wanna argue and stress
You always say you could've stayed with your ex
Well I guess you coulda'
But deep inside I know that you don't wish you woulda'
'Coz when you was with him
You was always checking for the kid
Late night coming to my crib

[Chorus]
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better
[Verse 2]
So so so, tell, tell me, tell me something
You really think it'd be that easy just to let me go
I know I try to play it cool when we fuss
But truth be told, my heart would be crushed
(Cuz it's just for you)
I'm tryin to settle down
(Tell me who)
You know could make you smile
(Like I can do)
Tell me who, tell me who

[Chorus]
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
Like me, like me
I, I know that you'll never finda
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better
[Bridge]
So, so, so
Baby I know
That without you I'd be broken down
But you'd feel the same
If I went away
Why can't you just say it?
Just say it! Just say it!
Forget it baby, it's cool
Cuz I already know

[Chorus]
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
Like me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

[Pre-Hook]
I'll cook your dinner
I'll even take out the trash
When your mind is cluttered
I throw it all in my bag
Baby, better yet I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you call my number
Lay it down on me

[Hook]
Yeah I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me
I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me

[Post-Hook]
Now baby I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you dial my number
Lay it down on me

[Verse 1]
You say you havin', car issues, license trouble
Vision gettin' pretty blurry 'cause your sight done doubled
Cause one eye so focused on your past and how your life was troubled
To the point where even if you meet a Mr. Right he'll suffer
One time for the independent women with children that's pickin' up with all they're baby daddy's slack
One time for the independent women that don't wanna be still dependent on piggying on they're baby daddy's back
But I know you ain't either
Even though you're curious I know you ain't eager
I know that's a positive 'cause you got no prerogative
You know I got a girl and you know I ain't gon' leave her
You think you my type? Oh I think I know yo' type though
I'm stereotypin' like a keyboard on a speaker
I never professed love unless I love a teacher
That was in college, I always liked 'em older
I guess that's why I fell in love with Queen Latifah
I like what I see in you
They tell you that you bein' mean, I say that you bein' you
Comin' from the same city where they ain't no bein' true
It could be discouragin' to a flower that's flourishin'
Gotta be full of yourself due to an ego that nobody's nourishin'
If we take a break we might hit a curb again
And take the risk of gettin' hurt again
If not this time it might not work again

[Pre-Hook]
I'll cook your dinner
I'll even take out the trash
When your mind is cluttered
I throw it all in my bag
Baby, better yet I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you call my number
Lay it down on me

[Hook]
Yeah I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me
I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me

[Post-Hook]
Now baby I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you dial my number
Lay it down on me

[Verse 2]
I love the girl that I was fuckin' over
I hate the girl that I was over-fuckin'
'Cause now it's nothin' but an old discussion
Almost forgot about it, so it wasn't
I'm way too focused on openin' new doors to get the heat out like an open oven
It's okay to toot your own horn if it's no 'percussion
But I ain't marchin' with a wedding band
She the type to meet a new nigga with a wedding plan
Your mind is cluttered, I would swoop you off your feet
But I got feelings on the shelf, and I hardly keep it neat
But I always think fun, so there's a party every week
And that's where I throw it
I sit on my watches, I'm on my own time
And you're never at the party 'cause you're never on my mind
I guess some things get better over time
But no more time mean to play your time's out
I don't wanna wait or stay to find out
Fuck this chat, I'm leavin' the room, I'm signed out
Then I ate her inside right after we dined out
Every time she comes, I arrive
My dick swings like it comes with monkey bars and a slide
And she slept over 'til the next mornin'
The other cried on my shoulder had the next mournin'
Last night was a movie so I kept scorin'
Now she's addicted guess my "no" was the best warnin'

[Pre-Hook]
I'll cook your dinner
I'll even take out the trash
When your mind is cluttered
I throw it all in my bag
Baby, better yet I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you call my number
Lay it down on me

[Hook]
Yeah I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me
I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me

[Post-Hook]
Now baby I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you dial my number
Lay it down on me



Yeah it's that lemonade
First Class yeah you know this is The Cook Up lets get it
O.K. I'm spitting these abortion bars all up on this lemonade
Got these other rappers really wishing they were never made
I'm always in the game these niggas never played
My gears always fucking sharp like I'm wearing blades
I only spit just so that I can get paid while these mothafuckas do it so they can get laid
I've been have these chicks open. Marcus Colston
Grabbing for my dick like a rebound. Postin
I got two bad chicks I call it double trouble and they both 10s that's a double-double
They got fat asses that's a double bubble
When they playing with my balls that's a double juggle
I'm serving up these bars call me the bartender
They say I should sell my rhymes but I'm not a bar vender
Man I just keep goin (goin) call me a machine
One of Octobers own but this ain't Halloween
I'm a punck line maniac this is my routine
The way I cook up all these bars you would think it's a cuisine
I'm not an undergroung artist more like a submarine
Got these mothafuckas bouncing kind of like a trampoline
I'm from that east coast, east side, EA we live we fly G5
Smoking up we high
Got your girl wet so I'm going in deep dive
The reason why all these schools buzzing. Beehive
Every where I go I always got my back pack
And girls ask me if I want to hit Black Jack
I'm made of money call me a casino
Make the haters sick to their stomach I should give them a beano
And I'm dangerous Scarface kind of like Pacino
When you see me call 911 Reno
Got a chip on my shoulder but I don't mean Doritos
And these niggas all beans it's a wrap burritos
I'm eight bars from greatness
The haters can't take it
The head above the shoulders I just see them shaking
Look I'm kind of gas I really can't fake it (no)
'cus if the right gears here my shit I'mma make it (Imma blowing up)
Yup man I know I'm gonna be blowing up and when that time comes I'mma drinking till I'm trowing up
In the club sipping bottle after bottle seeing 20/20 nigga I an't got them beer goggles
Chicks grinding on my slow moving like a snail man
And they open up for my delivery. Mail man
Look I got this on lot like a gel man
You think I'm being funny like Doug. Quell man
Dog I'm so serious
(not really)



[Verse 1]
My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light
Are you ready to go? We gon' be waitin' in line
Yeah, you look good, would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that, almost
Back home with that, next time
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
Freeway

[Chorus]
Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me (smiles on me)
I feel their smiles on me (smile on me)
I feel their smiles on me (lens on me right now)
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah (Know I got some sins on me)
Then get the scream mask for the vert rides (ridin')
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizin' (got some sins on me)
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college
This thing won't last unless we're both lyin' (both lyin')
Fake flowers, no water needed
Real life drowned by the weekend
No "whens", call it timeless
No ends 'cause you're timeless

[Chorus]
Despite our history, yeah
Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me (all this life)
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me (on me, on me, on me)
I feel their smiles on me
I feel their smiles on me

On me, on me
On me, on me



[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light
Are you ready to go? We gon' be waitin' in line
Yeah you look good, would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that, almost
Back home with that, next time
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley (Come on!)
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
Freeway

Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me

I feel their smiles on me (Lens on me right now)
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah (Know I got some sins on me)
Then get the scream mask for the vert ride (Ridin')
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizin' (Got some sins on me)
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college
This thing won't last unless we're both lyin' (Both lyin')
Fake flowers, no water needed
Real life drowned by the weekend
No wins, call it timeless
No ends 'cause you're timeless (Timeless!)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me

Ayy roll up this

Cameras, cameras on me when I'm bent
Mix the waterfall right behind the tent (Yeah)
Backseat, spacious, I pulled up, spaceship, yeah (Turn it)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I don't know if I ever told you this before, before
But you're the only one I ever waited for this long
And now the room is crowded, right now
So tell me are you about it, right now?

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
I've been thinking of you all the time
There's been various issues, but would you let me, let me tonight?

[Verse 2: Kyle Christopher]
Got all them couples floating on your pink champagne
You know there's bottle service, bottle service, babe
Long as the DJ's playing all these raunchy songs
Girl, we can do this on the dancefloor all night long
Now I know the room is crowded, right now
But tell me are you about it right now?

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
I've been thinking of you all the time
There's various issues, but would you let me, let me tonight?
See, I've been dreaming of you in the daytime
And it ain't right, so would you let me, let me tonight?

Now listen, don't you get this twisted girl
If I leave you, without you, I miss you girl
And if I had you right now, I wouldn't change a thing
You tell me this ain't what you're used to
But baby can't no man judge you
I can tell ain't no man loving you
I can tell ain't no man loving youLet me start by saying I feel like an asshole right now, but a tough decision had to be made in regard to my schedule over the next few months. The casualties of that decision include my appearances at upcoming festivals in Europe and my opening slot on the European leg of the Coldplay world tour. Sorry as fuck, I'll be back if you'll have me

[Verse 1]
Donald Trump said buy an apartment with her (uh)
Buying an apartment with ya
Greenspan said the rate was good
My pastor says that your faith is major
Best friend said I ought to wife you today
Like jumping over the broom
The white dress and all, yup the rice and all

[Pre-Chorus]
They said you love that girl
You need that girl
But don’t you let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who going solo baby?
I know, you told 'em baby
Watch you, you tell 'em baby
It’s cool, it’s cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know them lights will never turn off
But it's cool
Cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool

[Verse 2]
Your father really likes me
He calls me son
Your brother, I think he hates me
But you say thats how you know it's right
Your mother invites me to dinner
All of the time
Only thing she’s been grilling is me

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep telling her I love that girl
I need that girl
I won’t let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who goin' solo baby?
I know, you told em baby
Watch you, you tell em baby
It’s cool, it’s cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off

[Bridge]
It’s strobing, baby, and they burning baby
But don’t worry baby, just stay close to me
They flashing, it’s like dynamite
This love will keep us about 55 degrees
Don’t mind the lights
Don’t mind the lights
The love is gonna keep us cool
The love is gonna keep us cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off

[Outro]
But it's cool
Cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool

All my fantasies is fucked up, you can hear their screams

Piece of paper in my mouth, let my demons out to play

Someone that Jesus couldn't save
I'm the real livin' evil, I speak on the devil’s nameliving. it’s a plain difference from dead. seen a dead body this afternoon. the people who felt they had that body in their lives, have to let it go. the memories of the life that used that body are just as finite as the bodies of those who remember him. the woman or man that enjoyed that mans body, will only have the thin almost holographic recollections for as long as they live. then again, who knows how long we live, and if life goes on after these heartbeats stop. who knows where life went when it left that body. who knows if it went anywhere, not you. matters of faith, are matters of faith and faith is not knowing. what i know is that when i see a body without life, i feel sort of childish. a kid in a big complicated existence. a game with no rules and no point of winning other than for the sport of it. like the things i know and have learned mean nothing really. a feeling of confusion about the point. a bone chilling awareness of my mortality. still i wanna live. live and bring other lives into this world to live and die as well. some would say we are one consciousness divided. i would say we’ll find out. but we do not know that. eh. life. where’s my fuckin lighter.

[Verse 1]
I hear the rain drops
Fall on my rag top
And come down the windshield of my car
Parked on the same lane
We came to get away
And trade our kisses after dark

[Pre Chorus:]
You were everything I wanted
Everything I thought I needed
When you said that you were leaving
You got my heart in a vault
You were the only one with a key
And I couldn't get free

[Chorus:]
Still locked in love
So locked in love
In love alone
My baby's gone
I'm locked in love (In love)
So locked in love (In love)
And I gotta get free

[Verse 2]
I feel the clouds start to form
In my mind but
Rain starts to pour, then blurs my eyes
Maybe there's one whose heart is worth more to you
Than the one you left behind
By throwing my quarters out into the water
I wish that you'd meet me here like you used to
A heart in a mind we shared
How could you take your half
I don't know, but it will never be the same

[Pre Chorus]
You were everything I wanted
Everything I thought I needed
When you said that you were leaving
You got my heart in a vault
You were the only one with a key
And I couldn't get free

[Chorus:]
Still locked in love
So locked in love
In love alone
My baby's gone
I'm locked in love (In love)
So locked in love (In love)
And I gotta get free, oh

[Bridge]
My baby's gone (My baby's gone)
The vault is closed (Is closed)
My heart is cold
And still all alone
Sometimes I hear my (Hear my)
My own heart beating, beating, beating
Against the wall

[Chorus:]
Still locked in love
So locked in love (So locked in love)
In love alone
My baby's gone
I'm locked in love (In love)
So locked in love (In love)
And I gotta get free, oh (Gotta get free)
(I'm locked in love) Still locked in love
So locked in love
In love alone my baby's gone
I'm locked in love (Oh baby)
So locked in love (Oh baby)
And I gotta get free

[Outro]
My hearts pleading, so free me
Won't you set me free?
My hearts pleading, so free me
Won't you set me free

I know it's been so long
And girl I hope you missed me
Cause you know I've been missing ya baby, missing my baby

But that just don't do it for me

Open up the door
Girl you got me throwed off
Cause whenever you kiss me, girl
Can you feel my heart beatin', oh
Look into your eyes, pretty waves of brown
If you only knew what I'm thinking about
But now you're right here, oh
And now it's so real
Shorty my plane leaves at nine A.M tomorrow
But between then and now we can go far

Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
That's the moment that I see her as she leaving
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in

Could you wait, it really won't be long?

Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone

"Millions of years of evolution, right? Right!? Men have to stick it in every place they can, but for women– women, it is just about security, and commitment, and– ah, whatever the fuck else!

You are very, very sure of yourself, aren't you?"

[Verse 1: Mann]
I, woke up and rolled up out the bed feeling like a king
My reality rare, I'm living like a dream
The world is unaware of the type of change I could bring to it
Who you know went through my struggle and this type of pain
It's only trouble after I bubble on top of things
I'm not the type of rapper who chase after guap and chains
Bro I do it 'cause I know my swag can stop a train
Just a young, wild nigga, Waka Flocka Flame
Follow me, as I ever so properly
Begin to break down this whole birthday philosophy
Honestly if you not part of the movement
I do not need you to figure have to offer me two cents
Man who's this? I surprise my damn self
My mom showed 'em she did it without a man's help
So God bless us with a present like everyday
So in her case e'ry day is her birthday
Get it? That's the message I deliver
Chasing dreams, tryna make figures as big as Jigga's
And you can hide the brick nigga, put the guns away
Follow me and it'll probably be

[Chorus: Frank Ocean (as Lonny Breaux)]
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay

Look, I'm not just your average Joe
And this is not just your average flow
This is something magical
Cali home-grown, extra potent homie, that's fo' sho'
And if you didn't now you know
This is everything I practiced for
Showtime, 'bout to make an impact in yo' life
The young graduate of '09
I'm more than just swag and dope rhymes
Or walking fashion show lines
My aura of [?] is gone shine
Like the sun during the day time
Yeah they was hot during they time, it's our turn
Do you not see me? I'm a star sir
Fresh off the plane looking for car service
I just landed in my dreams and I'm 'bout to go sightseeing

[Chorus: Frank Ocean (as Lonny Breaux)]
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay, a lovely day

[Verse 3: Mann]
BDB established at the Grand Lux
Tryna find a perfect name to brand us
Had to identify the type of name I wanna push
And then the birthday mojo came through in the clutch
BDB, I was like, "it stand for what?"
Birthday Boys bro, in the cake we trust
Everyday our B-day, everyday we fresh
And everyday we celebrate, celebrate with us
That's why your girl leave you to come hang with us
What y'all be trippin' off [?], ain't a thang to us
Livin' life, everything is plush
And when she were here mayne, it ain't a rush
When she roll with a B-day boy, feeling dangerous
And the kush grade A+
Behind my back they hate us
But in my face they hush, they sus'
Sleepin' on Mann, nigga, wake up
[Chorus: Frank Ocean (as Lonny Breaux)]
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay, a lovely day
A lovely day
A lovely day

Play a couple chords, jump on board
If you wanna ride out (if you wanna ride out)
I'mma hit a few keys, bring you down to your knees
So you don't wanna leave now (don't wanna leave)
I got you up in my house now, ow
Fix you up another Mai Thai, Thai
No sun on the horizon, on
Let's make a song for the night time, time

Stroke of harmony, kiss you on your neck

We take it down to a minor C, C
We making noise like we can't believe, ay

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said, "You going to school, I’ll give you a summer"
Then she met No I.D. and gave me his number
Ten years later, she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
And I’m rapping on the beats they was supposed to buy
I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
Downtown, mixing fabrics, tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic, uh
A million hits and the web crashes, damn
South Park had 'em all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin', uh
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain’t no fashion show, mothafucka, we live it

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I pledge allegiance to my Grandma
For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm and Hammer
Straight out the kitchen, shh, don’t wake Nana
Built a republic that still stands
I’m tryna lead a nation to leave to my little man's
Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up Yaya?
What’s that smell? Oh, I’m just boiling some agua
No papa, bad Santa
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
I got my liberty chopping grams up
Street justice, I pray God understand us
I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
This is the Star Spangled Banner

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta

Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Yes, we did

Yes, we did



[Verse 1]
Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles 'til I'm at the greyhound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinking 'bout what my mother would say
As I'm singing an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

[Verse 2]
So I turn around and headed to the old run-down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back
I watch the upper-classmen drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them
Still haven't got over it yet
It's been playing in my ears all morning I swear
My iPod's the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

[Bridge]
Never get mad enough to walkout
If I do then I won't be gone for long
Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what I'll love her just the same
That's my mama, yeah
So no matter what I ain't leaving unless she's coming soon

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't



[Verse 1]
Girl when I met you
The numbers were runnin' through my head
I coulda wrote down your number
But I memorized them instead, ooh
And on the first date, remember the minutes spent together
You called me Rainman, then kissed me for three seconds
Ooh, no one else has ever fit the equation quite like you

[Hook]
White picket fence and house to make love
Two kids and a dog named Doug
Thanksgiving dinner, snow fast in the winter
Keys to the truck, crib and the car
Add the life that we live for us
Get rid of the life that we live for us
Multiply by trust, divide by trust
It equals love, equals love
You're part of the math, you're part of the math
You're part of the math, you're part of it all
You're part of the math, you're part of the math
The math, the math, the math, the math

[Verse 2]
You see, if colors were numbers, you'd be a fuchsia seven
And I'd be a platinum three, and we could be a ten together
Oh, and I don't ever want to part, subtraction or division
And if you ever left
I'd go full calculus to get you back, back, back
Geometry, you're math
Cause the fact is, no one else quite fit the equation like that

[Bridge]
I said, one plus one says it equals two
Baby me and you only equals love (It equals love, it equals love)
If one means one then it just ain't two
And it can't be love cause it's only one

[Verse]
I memorized the wayward expressions
Never look down
Never let you see me down
I memorized the way no directions
Can I come over now
I'd like to stay a little while
I memorized your body exposed
I can fuck you all night long
From a memory alone

I never forget a face
Don’t go plastic on me
Nothing’s set in stone
You're not dipped in gold
Dipped in gold
You can’t breathe if you’re dipped in gold
You are not on paper
You are not a copy
You're so, you're so..so thick, so thick

Aries
Maaan. The Aries doesn't know how to be fake, they are very into their own ways. An Aries doesn't copy people; no matter what the fashion trends are, the Aries dress how they want. The type of person who you can have around three completely different types of people and they will act exactly the same. Not good with finding women, the Aries is very straightforward and this can mess up their fating techniques. The Aries isn't the best guy for a drunken two-man, if the girls are drunk babbling, being stupid, he doesn't put up with it on order to have sex with them later - calls them out on their stupidity.

Taurus
The best mothers. A Taurus is extremely selfless, the Taurus loves to focus on others. I know a Taurus who has a job, where she is the boss of everyone, when others are lazy she does their job for them while still handling her own duties and doesn't even say anything about it. A Taurus would rather see you, - you as in the people they love -  be happy than themselves  be happy. The Taurus loves to listen to gossip, watch moves and listen to music about other people. People fascinate the Taurus. They are extremely passionate about whatever it is they stand for. A Taurus' opinion on something can never be changed, they don't loose arguments, you just have to give up. Very silly; they think simple things are funny. Not a drama-starter for others but for themselves they love it. If the Taurus doesn't have someone hating on them or somebody to prove wrong they get bored.

Gemini
A brick wall, great at hiding emotions. The girl I like is a Gemini. I couldn't tell if she liked me back I had to straight up ask. When it comes to love, they have to be safe, they won't put their feelings  out into the world to be rejected or something. They hate BS, if you're in a life-or-death situation with a Gemini they are going to hold it together 100 per cent. Born smart, they look at situations and can access the feelings of both parties involved. If you need someone to manage your life pick a Gemini. They are going to ride for you, every single one of these May babies are very hilarious: Dean Martin was a Gemini.

Cancer
The sensitive one. The Cancer takes family and friends very seriously and makes sure others are doing OK before they are doing OK. Will give a bum his last dollar type of guy. The Cancer gets so lucky all the time; because of their endless selflessness they have great karma. I know a man who walked onto a film set to be a boxing instructor for an actor. He was so charming though, and was fresh out the penitentiary, that the director chose him to act instead of the professional actor! The luck of the Cancer is insane. Constantly, they are wondering how you're doing, if everything is ok with you - they suck at talking about themselves. Annoying lovers, ha. The love so much it can be overwhelming, but the non-cancers see that, they can't help it, the love blossoms and grows. Great assistants or bodyguards. Cancer is great at taking orders.

Leo
Leos only know extremes. Leos are normally great friends to others. The 'take a bullet' type of friend - and not in a 'I would take a bullet for you' type of way. If someone was shooting a gun in the party the Leo would find you and make himself a human shield. I personally know a Leo who works for a company, the boss of that company made a comment about the Leo's friends tie in the office in confidence to the Leo. Every in the office sucks up to the boss but this Leo looks at his boss and says "Hey, that's not funny." To his boss! Leo's don't care who you are or what it means if your relationship goes sour; if you don't keep it real the Leo has no respect for you. The Leo loves confrontation, any chance at a problem and he'll take it. The Leo is the most passionate lover and coldest at the same time. Leos love to think: think more, feel less is their motto. A Leo will think himself into another dimension of himself he created while thinking so damn hard, ha.

Virgo
Virgos are always a little bit lazy. Great working bees, give them a task and it will be completed to a tee, but try and get them to push their own campaign or task? Forget about it. Always filled with useful information, love to study; maybe not necessarily school but they study something. If a Virgo loves music, they spend Friday nights listening to records. Ridiculously personable, very easy to bring around new friends, Virgos make their presence know but it's not overbearing when they stand in a circle and speak. Virgos are observant; can make a lot of on-point observations about someone's personality after only a few minutes of hanging out. A Virgo would be the best interviewer for a job.

Libra
They're all about longevity. The Libra is the type to always be waiting, hopeful, always have some project or something coming next. There's a libra in my friend group who's mom died (Kevin White - let's stop beating around the bush) and he handled it very well. He had to move out of his house he grew up in; he had to abruptly become an adult with no fallback plans but he did it promptly and precisely and wasted no time in making it happen for himself. He's got his own apartment, a car, and still has time to skate and model. Libras are insanely level headed and logical. Even when they do things that seem crazy, the explanation makes it make sense every time. Great lovers, always in or about to be in a relationship. The Libra deals with emotion very well, nothing overwhelms the Libra. Problems are dealt with poignantly. Libras are always the sense of security in a friendship group. Libras and Leos know how to fight; fight physically and mentally.

Scorpio
Every Scorpio is blindly, no-practice-needed, amazingly talented at something. Kevin Bradley will not skate for 3 months, hop back on his board roll around for 5 minutes and look like he never took a break, he's a real Scorpio, ha. They are always the spokesman for cool in their friend group. The Scorpio loves to act, not think. They make decisions at the drop of a hat, when they pass a window of a store with something they like it's in their last possession 4 minutes later. Scorpios focus on themselves, not in a self-centered way, more in a 'it'll be more fun to hang around me if I'm happy' type of way, ha. The Scorpio is not a reliable person. Their lack of thinking about decisions causes their decision making to be very abrupt, so if they say they are coming somewhere and in the last second hey get a feeling to not go, the don't go. Simple as that, ha. Don't call a Scorpio if you're dying on the streets.

Sagittarius
The Sagittarius doesn't move fast, ever Sagittarius is very calming and almost boring to some people. They are very confident and smart with money. They have a knack for wooing women, they're calm and their sternness reminds women of their father they either had - or never had. The Sagittarius lets his spirit speak for him not his clothes or car. They need nothing to show they are wealthy cause they don't care for you to know they are wealthy. The Sagittarius will have a really nice car and just laugh and quietly say thanks if you end up seeing it after work. They will never make it their priority to let you know something like that. Extremely ambitious, the Sagittarius will work until he's dead.  Their confidence causes them to always be true to themselves. They will never do something solely because someone thinks it's a good idea, if they don't feel it, they don't do it.

Capricorn
A born leader. When Capricorns are little kids their influence is so strong that grown men may look at them for mannerisms and style to copy.  Capricorns are always calm and quietly confident, the kind of confidence that doesn't need to speak. Capricorns are awkward lovers. The confidence and need to swag makes it hard to let others in. I know a Capricorn who dresses crazy, if you lay his outfits on a bed they look horrible. But when he wears them it's a completely different story.

Aquarius
Very low-key, this paragraph was hard to write because everyone I know who is an Aquarius doesn't like to tell you when it's their birthday, ha. The Aquarius is a slave to routine; they love doing the same thing everyday. They would rather practice something and become very good at it rather than having a bunch of halfway developed different talents. They like to keep their friend group small. When the Aquarius meets new people it takes them a while to start talking about siblings or old stories. Great listeners. If you do a crime, bring an Aquarius, they will never snitch on you 100 per cent. In middle school a kid and I got in an argument over a game of kickball before it could even get physical my buddy Cameron comes out of nowhere and throws a kickball in the other kid's face, directly after the bell rings, we give each other a look, then go inside. Nobody said a word to any teachers, Cameron and victims were both Aquarius.


Pisces
The most secretively sensitive person you've ever met! The Pisces will have a million and one problems with someone/something but would rather just mentally check them off the list than talk it out. The Pisces is sensitive in a 'fuck you' type of way, not a 'get sad and cry' type of way. Because of constantly avoiding conflict the Pisces is usually a great spirit. Halfway thinkers, they don't think too much like Leos, but aren't like the Scorpio: the Scorpio just goes, never thinks but that's another story, ha. These February/March babies have a great talent of giving hope and inspiring others to do something great. Imagine this person, Johnny. Johnny gets double-crossed on a construction job where he is promised the contract by Friend (Friend is the opposing made-up character). When Friend gives another construction company the job, instead of getting mad and arguing, Johnny goes and works hard, ends up getting 10 jobs that were better than the first one and makes a lot of money. Johnny and Friend bump into each other at a party in the town center, Friend says, "Johnny how have you been?" Jonny says: "I've been very successful lately." And Johnny and Friend never have the same relationship but always remain friendly. Ha, that is a Pisces.



How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically I don't have no more new places to go



[Verse 1]
I’ll stack these magazines in the corner
After I’m done with them
And I still got the same hope that I started with
That you’ll be in one of them
My camera shed some tears since you left him
With nothing, with nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to remember?
I got the memories
But memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl?
When I’m older, and my mind is telling me to forget you
What’s gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

[Verse 2]
We didn’t make love
We celebrated its invention
Confetti on the mattress – I used to have those images
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
Along with my hard drive, no notes, no goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Tell me now, I got the memories
But memories don’t last…
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?
When I’m older, and my mind’s telling me to forget you
What’s gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss you

[Verse 3]
No videos, no polaroids
No record of the love we had
My Nikon wasn’t fast enough
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frame, no
Just got them little basic ones that the pictures frames come with
Models, wedding pictures, you know

[Chorus]
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn’t wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so…

[Intro]
That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice 'cause his wind gone
Niggas sound like Reggie
(Already, ran through already
Nigga goin' in, fuck it)

[Verse]
Pray to the pipe, (fuck it) I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow, I'm mindful of size
She chock full of my swipe, like a capsule sealed tight
With that substance you need, start a family tonight
Big body Merc, LED lights and it's all overprice
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in, from the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watching my fence, like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope, got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my my
Get it, get it

[Intro]
When the wind blows
That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice cause his wind gone
Nigga sound like Reggie
If life is a woman them walls gone
They ran through her already

[Verse]
I'm thinking
My life is a virgin like wife in all white and
Tonight I'm determined
To give her insight, eat her right till she creams
'Till she writhes with delight
Ándale ándale, make her pray to the pipe
Make her worship that false phallic idle
I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow
I'm mindful of size
She's chockful of my swipe like a capsule
Sealed tight with that substance you need
Start a family tonight
In this Camry we might
Mean this big body Merc with the leather
Oak and the LED lights
That I don't even drive
I'm in London tonight
And it's all overpriced
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in
From the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich
Or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watchin' my fence
Like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope
Got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my my
Get it, get it







All day plagues, I've wondered
We threw grace, I'll find a new high (?)
Could it be you?



[Verse 1]
Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch Westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Live in the clouds
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Life in the clouds
Keep em high, y'all
Beautiful stars
In the sky

[Verse 2]
Monks in the mosh pit
Stage diving Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a runaway, young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhaya Mudra

[Bridge]
I never ask for much
But please keep up lover
We've got no choices left
The running's fast
Run, run, run, run
You're beautiful to me
Run, run, run, run, you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world, my world

[Verse 3]
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archers' bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end

[Outro]
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Keep 'em high, y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me, oh (Right)
Beautiful

[Intro]
One, two

[Chorus]
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
A dream maker (Maker)
My heart (You heart) breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' that way (The same)

[Refrain]
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasin' after all the same
Chasin' after our ends

[Chorus]
Moon river, wider than a mile
Crossin' in style someday
My dream maker, heartbreaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' the same

What I see, who I become
What I see, who I become
We're all chasin' after our ends
Chasin' after our ends

MY RANDOM

I miss all the tension
When all this is over
I’m moving to ghana
You sus and you watching me
They used to be brown
Now them contacts is green
Why the fucks u finessing me
I know how many licks
It’ll take me to get
To the center of ecstasy
How come the ecstasy
Only depresses me so
Chemically I don’t have
Any new places to go
Every face looks pale
When the seraton’ gets a lil low
When they lower my coffin
Bet a few bitches jumpin in the hole
Few old ones that I left alone
I never lie cus I don’t remember
No tales cus it’s two heads
Even twelve got a lil forgiveness
Who do you love?

[Verse 1]
The first time your name was used
It was beauty and I knew
Sat in a violet room with some people I saw through
Gathered 'round the television's fire
Watching for the people I admired
Outside my words were frozen in my mouth
I couldn't let them out

[Chorus]
When I see my willing heart
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?

[Verse 2]
It's a strange spell that we lust for
Every now and then, every now and then
Every now and then, every now and then

[Chorus]
When I see my willing heart
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?
[Verse 3]
It's a strange spell that we watch for
And one I swear I never saw
Every now and then, every now and then
Every now and then
You're still on my screen
Every now and then
You're still on my screen
Every now and then
There's a glare from the sun and it's heavenly
Every now and then

[Chorus]
When I see my willing heart
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?

[Verse 4]
It's a strange spell that we watch for
Every now and then
You're still on my screen
Every now and then
They must have heard my scream
Every now and then
There's a glare from the sun and it's deafening
Every now and then
[Chorus]
When I see my willing heart
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?


[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Been breathing so hard, we both could use the oxygen
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Just hop on my back, I'll take you down the stairs
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Into my backyard, then lay you right on the grass, eh

[Pre-Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Give it to you over again, over again, over again
Over again

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Making love
Underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl
Tell me how my nature feels
Said, oh, baby (Oh, baby)
Up against the cherry tree (Ah, ah)
Baby girl (Baby girl)
I'll give it to you naturally
Naturally, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Feeling like Adam when he first found out this existed
"Ha, wow..."
Me and my Eve trying out our first positions
Ha, yeah
And it's all good, and it's all free
And it's all you, and it's only me
Playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you
Yeah (Ah-ah)

[Pre-Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Give it you over again, over again, over again
Over again

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Said, making love
Underneath the cherry leaves (Ah, ah, ah)
Baby girl
Tell me how my nature feels (Ah, ah)
Said oh, baby (Oh, baby)
Up against the cherry tree (Ah, ah)
Baby girl (Baby girl)
I'll give it to you naturally

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
My cavewoman
I'm a caveman
Doing wild things
In a wild land
We keep going, baby
We keep getting it, baby
We'll get pebbles, maybe
A couple bam-bams
Bam, bam
Bang, bang
Girl, your heart goes
Bam and bang
Feel my heart go, go, go...

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Bridge: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys, I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me, want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation, y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out, I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free, you niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me, you know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys, fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves, y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye, y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country so you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters, so I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up, they tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison, get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons, braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house, I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse and in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up, I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out, now what the fuck they gon' say now?
[Outro: Kanye West, Frank Ocean & Kóbor János]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt (mhm-igh)
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

So let's get too high, get too high again
(Too high again, too high)

[Part II: wet wet]

[Verse: StoryofSaint]
I just took a portal to the nether, I'm returning never, if you want me hit my cell up (My cell up)
Dots and cuts, my area is fashioned
Blades could propel you, get the hell-i out my sector (My sector)
These villains walk around with the ender (ender), draggin' youths to creep up on a nigga
Squeezing triggers same way they squeeze rations, now he got to rob you to make sure it doesn't happen (It won't happen)
All I want was mansions with the mandem chatting pasa ('ing pasa)
Moonrock on the block'll make you think you stepped in NASA (In NASA)
'Bout to make it great again and I ain't talking MAGA (MAGA)
When I die, somebody tell the mayor I want a statue (A statue)
I done way too much to let my mama be unhappy (Unhappy)
C-D-X-V-I-I, Roman numerals I stand by (I stand by)
Never been the bad guy but my folks'll call me bad man (Bad Mon), something 'bout the treatment of these niggas
I-C-Y-M-I I am the real'est, tired of the villains? Nah (!)
Yah-ah-ah
[Interlude]
See, I'm just cruising in the coupe because my tunes sound better
Kingpin, I got my own damn agenda
Pretty Ricky, if I want her, I'ma get her
I ain't got to worry who getting jealous, darling

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Wanna see Nirvana, but don't want to die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every night shit

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, (bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you, everybody needs you
Oooh, nani nani

No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnin's, ahh
New beginnin's, wake up akh

Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit

And the look back's gettin' me right

[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every night shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every night shit

[Intro]
Go for it

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody, being honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporate
My whole body see-through
Transportation, handmade (G!)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy, have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right, you know I won't need you
And I tell you (Biiitch!)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that, I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation, can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You were from my past life, hope you're doing well, bruh

Always like the head first, signal coming in and out (Huh?)
Hope you're doing well, bruh

New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep being late on me
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, everyday shit

[Chorus]
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that nana, though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
Every night shit
Night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit

[Verse 2]
Bubble goose down, blue punch
Pocari Sweat, ghost sweat
Her wet wet, her mouth wet, two things I don't regret
My dick long, memory long, two things she don't forget
Game drives so wet, my Black friends just wear black
But only fly in black jets, if it's roulette, black's best
Niggas ain't sold crack yet
Flyin' private, ain't wasting seats
Niggas lapped up in that bitch
Black bodies in the summer breeze
Runnin' four flats, tryna get in the lead
Tryna get in the league and play wide receiver
Nigga, pass the sticks, call winners winners
Up-seat, gotta walk it off
Winners hate to lose, gotta run they mouth
Sets thrown, now they lockin' up
We ain't break it up
Tryna see who face getting knotted up
That was Monday, we was back friends on Tuesday
Still talkin' 'bout it 'til this day
Need fifty hunnas, that's 5 racks
Hit Costco, keep the fam fat
Fuck a weed-man, grow your own plants
Tell the cashier give you five blacks and the purple packs
Some loud burnin' out on the grill
Black Adonis on the diving board
Gainers only, I'm bringing Guinness
Jordans floatin' on the deep end of the pool (Yes)
Somebody got thrown in again, y'all are fools
Phone drown on the concrete in the summer blaze
Blaze too, blaze too
And it better work when the morning breaks through
[Break]
Oh we gon' line it up? Nah, nah
I just... What?!

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnings, ahh
[Inaudible talking]
New beginnings wake up, akh
The sun's going down
(I just got these shoes man)
Time to start your day, bruh
(Look at 'em... Look, they're fucked)
Can't keep being late on me
(Some more fuckin' shit)
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
[Inaudible talking]
The every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that nana, though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, every night shit, everyday shit
Every night shit
Night shit, night shit, night shit
[Bridge]
I'm buck now, I'm peaked out
I'm in the red like chyoon-chyoon-chyoon

Them strokes, oh, don't watch that

Them strokes, oh, don't watch that
We both know
You used to be my everyday, every night shit

[Instrumental Outro]

Round your city
Round the clock
Everybody needs you
No you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody being honest with you
Breathe till I evaporated
My whole body see thru
Transportation handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working thru your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (biiitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin no I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up
Did you call me from a saiyonce
You are from my past life
Hope you're doing well bruh

Always like the head first
Signal coming in and out
Hope you're doing well bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Oooh nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body

New beginnings ahh
New beginnings wake up akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day bruh
Can't keep being late on me
You know you need the money if you gon survive the
Every night shit
The every day shit
Dropping baby off at home
Before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though
Could you come by
Fuck wit me after my shift
You know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit that's everyday shit

Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's getting me right

(Wet Wet)

Every night fucks everyday up
Everyday patches the night up
On god u should match it it's that KO
No white lighters till I fuck my 28th up

1998 my family had the acura
Aww the legend/
Kept at least 6 discs in changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the reverends
Preaching self made millionaire status
When we  could only eat at Shoney's on occasion

After trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night
Dropping baby off at home
Before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though
Could you come by
Fuck wit me after my night shift
You know them boys wanna see me broke down
Bummed out
Stressed out
Everyday shit
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit everynight shit
My everyday shit everynight shit

Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
-was our philosophy
Oooh, nani nani (ooh ah)
No bitch [?]
Your [?] in my lap, uh
Backwards at Pilates
Back to back that voodoo got-

[Verse 1]
Can’t break my heart if it’s already broken
Can’t dry your eyes if they already soaking
What’s done is done and now we left with the blunt of our repercussions
Communication is dead there ain’t no need for discussions
I block yo gram soon as I can so i can’t see who you fuck with
These new adjustments hit my body with a clang
How we go from co-pilots to us jumping from the plane
Now we both gone show silence as we cover up our pains
How the growth was once vibrant now it hides beneath the blame
Is it me or is it you?
Lack accountability for all the things we do
Quickly making these decisions without niggas thinking through
Difference in the moves only show that we similar in our forms of healing
I like to drink away my woes, you like to force the feelings
Out ya body like you got exorcists here performing magic
We drive reckless with emotions so of course we crashing
But there ain’t no airbag to support our sadness
Plus we ain’t prepare with any form of action
Enough of passion
We passively get aggressive
We barely trust what we saying
We asking each other questions
You trying to go through my phone
I’m trying to get on your socials
We heating up more than ever
We finally getting vocal
You try telling me I’m wrong
And i hate accusations
I feel the patience in my body start evaporating
Evacuation of the scene might just be the best
Hesitation in my legs
My heart start beating through my chest
How our frequencies meet static, how these pieces don’t connect
We was pose to be them Twitter goals these dreams gon be suppressed

[Bridge]
But i now it feel that love is fading
It don’t come around
Stuck out in the ocean
You gon watch me drown
Sluggish in my motions
When you let me down
This shit is getting ugly
Please don’t hit my line
Because you never loved me
Please don’t waste time
Cause you never trust me
Second chances dead
Cause you forever dub me



[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
R.I.P. Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel, like twigs wit’ them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body-jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came witcha
But he ain't witcha
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I may be younger, but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here, I'll save some for you
I'm not him, but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

[Verse 1]
I'm running from the man, I'm running from my flag
I made love to my lady before I packed
I left her while she slept
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cos I got her

[Hook]
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
But I won't risk her life for mine
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

[Verse 2]
I'm running water through my hands
And flipping pictures in my head of her
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun
So I wouldn't worry as much
Oh, last night
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cos I got her
(I got you, oh)

[Hook]
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(I wis you could be my Bonnie)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(Won't risk your life)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(I know you love me)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(You wanna be where I am, but no, girl)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie
[Bridge]
The money should last awhile
But I know without a dime she got me
When the feds come around she got me
No snitching allowed from my baby

[Hook]
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(My Bonnie)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(My Bonnie)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie
(No Bonnie)
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(Oh girl, I wish you could be mine)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(Won't you risk your life, no Bonnie, your life)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

[Outro]
So sorry
So sorry
No Bonnie

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked, whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die, the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain’t cheap
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild



[Verse 1]
Okay, thought about it for a minute
Can't let love go spinnin' down the drain now
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
Simple math, pen & pad; gotta work out
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
But you're my only, baby you're my only
Just grab a pencil, don't you wanna help out
It can't be hard

[Pre-Hook]
You gotta find the answers to the problem
Ain't no answers here without you, no

[Hook]
I been writin' all day, fillin' my page
Tryna fix this, wreckin' my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writin' all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm gonna tell you everything
The whole truth, not fractions of a bad lie
You're my homie, baby you're my only
She's the past, you're my future, my right now
You're my only, baby you're my only
And I'm sorry, girl you gotta know it
Grab a seat, just try to hear me out girl
I know it's hard

[Pre-Hook]
You gotta find the answers to the problem
Ain't no answers here without you, no

I been writin' all day, fillin' my page

It's no love, none
No love still

[Bridge]
Wish I could use a calculator, but it won't even work
I can't use an elevator, to get back up to you
To get back up to you
Never had a clue

[Hook]
I been writin' all day, fillin' my page
Tryna fix this, wreckin' my brain
No love still
No love still

[Verse 1]
I’m knocking on your door, and it's cold, yes it's cold
But I brought your favorite flowers, teddy bear and a card
Cause I know that loving me is a chore, it’s a chore
But I won’t stop loving you that’s for sure, that’s for sure

[Hook]
You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there’s no way, no how I’ll stop loving you
It’s non-stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
It won’t stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain’t gonna slow
It’s non stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
I sat down in my car, not to leave, just to park
I’m still not losing hope, though the sky's getting dark
I wish you’d just peak out the blinds to my heart
But you turned your bedroom light on
Well at least that’s a start

[Hook]
You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there’s no way, no how I’ll stop loving you
It’s non-stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
It won’t stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain’t gonna slow
It’s non stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
[Bridge]
Said I’m sorry, oh baby
But the love won’t stop, no no, nah uh
Take me back, oh love, Take me back
Cause the love will keep flowing on
The love will keep flowing on

[Verse 1]
Clean your room, momma’s coming home soon
She needs you, momma’s gonna burn too
Close your eyes and remember all of me, and I will take you to eternity
You’ve got a sundress on it’s december, I missed my flight but I can’t remember

[Pre Hook]
Carry me to the trees, I want to know what you mean to me
Carry me, help me feel free, I kinda know what you need, what you need

[Hook]
Oi Ah ah
Got me peelin on a light
Got me got me fucked up
On me million dollar bike
Got me got me fucked up
Got my million dollar bike
Got me got me fucked up
Got me setting up up, Got me

[Verse 2]
I get your feedback marry her, (get me on my bike)
But I don’t want to run away with ya (get me on my bike)
And I’m not trying to build some character (get me on a bike)
On your one track mind

[Bridge]
An add-on room where it starts again, asleep at noon, where did this all begin? Man, I wish she’ slip my mind, fucked up that night
But I know I’d try again. Another fight, should I start begging, knew I wish I’d been right honey, knew I wish I’d been right honey, knew I wish I’d been right

[Outro]
Do you want her? Or do you want this high life?
(do you want me?)
Do you want her? Or do you want this high life?
(do you want me?)
Do you want love? Or do you want this low life?
(do you want me?)
Do you want love? Or do you want this low life?
(do you want me?)
Well, I know them,  come comb my hair, (don't comb my hair)
I missed my flight because of you, (I missed my flight)
Well, I don’t care

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Whatever you do, young king, don’t wind up dead
Young queen, cross your legs

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
'cause even diamond chains are for slaves
Don’t set foot in no penitentiary
And don’t taste the poison
Don’t you bail on your families



if i could dream about this place right now that’d be nice. had a dream about obama and some missing kid last night. i was in a warehouse fight scene too for some reason. like a jackie chan rumble in the bronx type thing. i think it’s because i watched too much tv yesterday. i mean, I'mma lil sick so i saw more of the tv yesterday than i would normally see in a week. that shit messes with your mind man.

currently on a long ass plane ride. going through my own little existential crisis. i wish i could talk to you all as friends. & im tempted, but the truth is you’re a mixed crowd. so i’ll spare the details… for now. unfortunately this emo shit is running concurrently with the most progressive weeks of my career so far. i’d like to enjoy the success more. but.. i am experiencing success. which is more than many could ever say. i don’t have any noteworthy or overwhelming gripes about this business. i may call certain people/institutions out for their bullshit from time to time. but the way i see it i make a decent living doing exactly what the fuck i want. how could i not be grateful? besides, i’m not famous. maybe a little popular. i do think social networks can make you feel a little bit more poppin than you actually are though. hahaha. anyhow, im gonna get a dog soon. i know it might not make sense.. i mean i’ll be/have been traveling a lot more frequently than i’m used to. but the companionship just might keep me off the proverbial ‘ledge’. what do you think of this guy?alrite. alrite. let’s get this out in the open. the only songs that i, myself, frank ocean, have ever released are…’pyrite’, ‘acura integurl’ & of course the songs included on ‘nostalgia, ultra’. all other songs are on the internet as a result of record industry email hacks/leaks that happened some years back. several of these songs i had no hand in writing. i only laid reference vox on em because i was being paid. the rest are incomplete ideas, reference songs that were sent out for placement on other artists. records that were never intended to represent me. notwithstanding, i am a chill bro. as well as a sage/zen master in training. so im not angry or anything. i just had to let it at least be known. enjoy.

[Skit: Rosie Watson]
Stop thinking of this as being money
It's just money, I'ma make more
No, no no no no no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing
Let's see, I have
Ooh yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you
Saving my seven dollars

[Verse 1]
I'm willing to die doing this shit
Might even take a life for this shit
By that I mean decode their lies for this shit
And watch you cry cause your shit

Freezer got gold rims
In debt, now go dim
This is what happens
When you too focused on balance

[Chorus]
Dollars come in a bakers dozen
Like we getting bread
But I know focusing on that too much
Will get us dead

So try to understand my footprints
But at the same time, make your own blueprints
If you want it, go for it
But know it's not just money

[Verse 2]
You're worrying about how much wealth it is
So you can add to your wrist
I'm confused how mumbling can get you a car
In the future, it can only take you so far

I won't judge what you wanna do
But it's kinda talentless, it's the truth
Like Cole said, "Imma make sure the real gon' prevail."
And not the people that only worry about the sales

Those sales might not even get you a nice boat
But that cold hard cash could maybe get you a coat
You're washing yourself in this ego to cope
And you messed up like you just dropped the soap

Ever since I was born in 2003
My family trying to make ends meet
Living in brick houses like Rob Zombie
And now I still don't care about where I live this week

[Chorus]
Dollars come in a bakers dozen
Like we getting bread
But I know focusing on that too much
Will get us dead

So try to understand my footprints
But at the same time, make your own blueprints
If you want it, go for it
But know it's not just money



[Verse 1]
I think I started something
I got what I wanted
Did-didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
At least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste"
But can you taste a little taste?

[Chorus]
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Verse 2]
Sink full of dishes, pacin' in the kitchen
Cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod
Little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick
This is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
But it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow
I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had
Never had, never had (Never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back
And pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around
Quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smokin' anyway? (Ahh)
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" (Ooh)
But can you taste a little taste?

[Chorus]
Novacane, baby, baby (Ohh)
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Bridge]
Novacane, novacane, novacane
Novacane, novacane (Ohh)
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain
Numb the pain, numb the pain (Ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane, novacane
Novacane, novacane
For the pain, for the pain (Ohh, ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane (Ooh)

[Outro]
Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, I can't feel a thing
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane, novacane, novacane
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane for the pain, for the pain
I can't, can't feel her
Feel her, feel her, ohh
Novacane, novacane-cane

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Dope boy still smelling like cocaina
White boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner?
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
I'm anti-Santa Maria
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket
Black card go hard when I'm shopping
Boat docked in front of Hermès picking cotton
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick
See me in shit you never saw
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
Aww, whole world's in awe
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Me and Ty Ty is like Pablo and Popeye
Winding dirt roads on mopeds spilling Opus
Welcome to the magnum opus, the Magna Carta
The best-selling author Decoded
On the holiday playin' "Strange Fruit"
If I'ma make it to a billi, I can't take the same route
Swoosh, that's the sound of the border
Swoosh, and that's the sound of a baller
Muhammad Hovi my back against the rope
The black Maybach, I'm back inside the boat
Shepard Fairey they finally gave me some hope
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote
Democrat? Nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn how to float
On the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean[Verse 1]
Fairy-tales come and take my hand
Turn the page and help me understand
Maybe, I'll fall in love again
If I know how the story ends
Her song has me
Looking for traces of my melody
And I slowly hum, sing the simple phrase
And not another she can deny
Caught in the sound waves
She can feel my every line
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah

[Hook]
So ohh in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

[Verse 2]
Found a way to whisper in her ear
Everything I wanted her to hear
Said I would catch her every tear
Hold her through the many years
So long I've been looking
For chances of this heart in me
Now I know that she's the lyric and the tune
That explains the meaning of life
There is no music
Without her to give it to me
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah
[Hook]
So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the one she loves
And I'm hoping that she plays me

Ohh in love

[Intro: Taco & Tyler, the Creator]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude
Shouts out to L-Boy, awwwwk
I told you

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
The big-eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, "Catch up, nigga," it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark-skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead (Not a Logic)
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five-panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang see, he did come back, though)

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
What's up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak (Yeah)
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher (What up, what up, what's up, smoke)
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
(We out here)
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, "Get 'em, Mike G," then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Culk
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area (Motherfuckin' area)
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
('Fore I bury ya)
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
(Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya)
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? (Wassup?)
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude: Frank Ocean]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a supercar for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pothead, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo)
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch (Wow)
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit (Woo)
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap (Shit)
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat (Cat)

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin & Earl Sweatshirt]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face (Ugh)
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler, the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word
And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah
Golf Wang



[Verse 1]
No baby don't do that, don't touch that
Could you please be still? (Baby, stop)
No baby, you can't have that, until you eat your dinner
Guess I gotta treat you like a baby girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing, oh oh
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, all for it
But it ain't easy, you won't make it easy

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Verse 2]
Now you know you should be sleeping, but okay
I'll give you ten more minutes
We've been sleeping in the same bed
Cause you been having nightmares
And you need me here
I guess I always treat you like a baby girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing aw yeah
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, uh huh
But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Verse 3]
You want love? Well no more sugar for you
And you don't know how to act, so no more sugar for you
You're jumping off the walls, no more sugar for you
I said ain't no sugar for you
Well, just a little bit, but

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Verse 1]
I've seen it and I liked it much
I told myself I had to have it
I looked, but I do not touch
Wondering why does she walk like that (that, that)
There was something in those jeans
Locked up
It was dying to be free
And it was bound to happen, oh

[Pre-Hook 1]
Didn't have a pick up line to use
I was way too cool, way too cool
And instead I hoped you're watching me too
Like I watched you

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

[Hook 2]
That's a good look baby, baby
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look
My eyes must have been on drugs
Your color and your shape looked so crazy
I couldn't see the floor beneath you
But, baby, I could see you pacing on
Thin air, mid-air, no
Long brown hair swinging, no
Red bottoms in your high heels
Like I'm watching a Blu-Ray

[Pre-Hook 2]
You in HD baby
I didn't know what to say
I was way too cool, I’m way too cool
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too
Oh yeah, you know it's true

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look
[Bridge]
I wanna stare at you some more
When I can feel you in my soul
I'm not looking from the outside
I could feel your hands in mine
I wanna grab on your body
Touching that booty
Feeling on your booty
Say that you love it
And you said it's all mine

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, couldn't run away from you
No, couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look
[Hook 2]
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look

[Intro]
What, where am I?

[Verse 1]
What's life like on a train?
Nobody there knows your name
As your decision changed
Do you wish that I came?
I thought you'd pick me up from work
I waited for your truck for half hour
I know you said you were gonna
But I never thought you'd leave

[Chorus]
This one thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody, oh

[Verse 2]
Square face and puppy eyes
Found out they never lied
Your old man lived in the sky
Left your house with a yard
But you went away a different try
Found a place that's your size
Too good to finish life here with me
I couldn't get you to say
Why you wouldn't let me come
What should be simple just ain't
And it shouldn't hurt like it does

[Chorus]
This one thing is made for us
Won't stay with us, it ain't saving us
But I'll take one thing over everything
I'll take that thing over anybody

[Bridge]
Baby, hold me, don't pick me up
I need a compliment
Just a touch from a friend
I need a gentle word
I need your company
I'll keep

[Chorus]
One thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over anything
I take that thing over anybody
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody
Oh, oh, anything
Oh, oh, take one thing

[Verse 1]
I fall on my knees and pray
For heaven to show me the answer
Make me complete today
Soul, heart, body, and mind
If I could ask for just one more thing
Send to me the perfect lover
And I, Wouldn’t want for anything
I’ll be happy in time, my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing

[Verse 2]
I hold out my hand
And pledge never to sell myself short
I’m vow to hold my head up
And i’m gonna keep it high
And I go out into the world wondering
If I make it too hard to find someone
To love me for me no more wasting my time
My heart
[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
Missing that One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing

[Bridge]
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who's gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Really need that one thing
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who’s gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Just that one thing
[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
Missing that One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing

[Bridge]
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who's gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Really need that one thing
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who’s gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Just that one thing
[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
Missing that One thing, one touch, one kiss

Just that one more thing

[Verse 1]
Sitting by my window
Watching the moonlight
In my home
Suddenly my mind
Is bringing out desire
In my home
So I got a new man
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

[Verse 2]
So I had a phone call
From a new man
In my home
He was burning
Burning of desire
Just like I do
He wanted me to
Put out this fire
Burning in his soul
[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Verse 3]
Suddenly my new man
Was in my arms
In my home
He was loving me
69 times
In my home
So I got a new man
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby

Oh, suddenly I caught ya
With a hook line and a sinker
You were swimming at the bottom, yeah

Well baby you can love up here, on land
And what a difference it makes, you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Verse 2]
You said you’re feeling ways
That you never could’ve felt under all that pressure
Used to it being dark at night, and you’re kinda afraid of the lights
But you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive
And what a difference it makes, you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love
[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Bridge]
Baby I could show you the world
And the seed that’s inside of my heart, baby
Don’t know how you got on land in the first place
Just promise you won’t go back again
It’s better up here you know
Just trying my best to show you
But you started feeling like you’re floating higher and higher
Don’t ever go under no more

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator]
Yeah, um
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting

[Interlude: Kids]
We're making s'mores by the campfire
Camp Flog Gnaw, Golf Wang summer

[Verse 2: Laetitia Sadier]
Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, but radical
Transformation ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart

Who ate all the fuckin' chocolate?
Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha

And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your headlights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator & (Frank Ocean)]
Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame Impala

And I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You’re fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don’t know, I think you’re chill
(Ride for)
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah

[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer

You remind me of my bimmer

[Outro: Lionel]
Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
I got a can of these baked beans too

[Verse 1]
Intimate scenes, fresh from my dreams
Of a triple X movie scene
I could care less about being seen
A higher self-esteem if you on me (Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar's so sweet, it'll rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me, yeah
Spoiled crazy

[Hook]
Public display of affection (Got 'em hatin')
Pointin' in our direction (Watch 'em watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
We be at the club, the restaraunt
The grocery store or the movie
Kissin' and touchin' with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, we is, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A

[Verse 2]
Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets
And were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we meet, the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense, you being tense
Has got me convinced
You're the fingers to my instrument
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
From the lobby to the patio (Boy you're so crazy)
And we so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navajo (You nasty)
And we so compatible

[Break]
The club, the restaraunt
The grocery store or the movie
Kissin' and touchin' with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, yes, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A

[Outro]
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)

[Verse 1]
I'll stack these magazines in the corner
After I'm done with them
And I still got the same hope that I started with
That you'll be in one of them
My camera shed some tears since you left him
With nothing, with nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to remember?
I got the memories
But the memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl?
When I'm older, and my mind is telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so
[Verse 2]
We didn't make love, we celebrated its invention
Confetti on the mattress – I used to have those images
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
Along with my hard drive, no notes, no goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Tell me now, the memories
The memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?
When I'm older, and my mind's telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you

[Bridge]
No videos, no polaroids, yeah
No record of the love we had, yeah
My Nikon wasn't fast enough
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frames, no
Just got them, little basic ones that the pictures frames come with
Models, wedding pictures, you know
[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

[Verse 2]
We didn't make love, we celebrated its invention
Confetti on the mattress – I used to have those images
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
Along with my hard drive, no notes, no goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Tell me now, the memories
The memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?
When I'm older, and my mind's telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you

[Bridge]
No videos, no polaroids, yeah
No record of the love we had, yeah
My Nikon wasn't fast enough
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frames, no
Just got them, little basic ones that the pictures frames come with
Models, wedding pictures, you know

[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

[Intro]
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (Ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (High)
Go head, fly that thing!
High, high, yeah
But fly alone

[Verse 1]
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known

[Chorus]
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

[Verse 2]
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse
And no, I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known, ever known
[Chorus]
I know what I was on (Ever known)
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

[Verse 3]
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'ma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my Pilot Jones

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
And the peaches and the mangos
That you could sell for me

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Hey, hey
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

[Outro: André 3000]
You're good at being bad, you're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fucking good
Make her swab the mu'fucking wood
Make her walk the mu'fucking plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

[Intro: Big Boi & Frank Ocean]

Oh, nah, nah

[Verse 3: Big Boi & Andre 3000]
(Hey, hey) Yeah
Doesn't matter if she wanna be with me, so it's cool
I make her call me B.B. King because I give her the blues
But not on purpose though, she was the perfect ho-stess
When I come over, we would do the grossest
Most beautiful-est things on a bed of roses
Would be the coldest when you hit the hardwood floor
We sippin' 'Gnac, not mimosas
She's in my naked lap, goin' HAM like she supposed to
And she could make it clap if I told her
Or make her ass spread like the back of a cobra
Standin' at attention like a soldier
A G.I. Joe, man, see, me, I go in (Ask a bitch, nigga)
Yeah, that nigga goes up in it
Like smoke through a chimney (Hey, hey)
Slow stroke, 'cause she feelin' me up in her, nigga
Killin' me softly, raw dog, she wants me
Strong and black like her coffee, get off me
Act a donkey, I pin her tail to the mattress
I've been a player, make her go from classy to nasty
Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty (Ha, ha, ha)
To sloosh (Hey, hey)

[Verse 4: André 3000]

You're good at being bad (Yep)
You're bad at being good (Oh)
For Heaven's sakes, go to Hell
Kno-, knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, uh (woo!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Verse 2]
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

[Chorus]
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Outro: Frank Ocean & Beyoncé]
Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality

Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse]
Grand mommy told me: "Don't run from no police" (Fuck 'em)
Grand mommy told me: "Watch out for yo partners" (I love 'em)
Saying "They too much older, won't you stay in your range?"
I been trying to sponge, been trying to know some things
See the mailman keep coming, and the bills keep on coming in
And all you wanna do is fight me on this shit
You say: "Don't go bending yo wrist, don't go being no sissy."
OK
"Don't go locking no doors, you ain't paying no rent in this bitch," OK
Checks I used to bring
They wouldn't make no difference in this bitch
Now the checks I bring, I mean
Who else paying the rent in this bitch?
Landlord see me outside, wanna take a picture
I said I gotta autograph on the check you can take it with ya
He said "The house on sale, you wanna buy it?"
I say, "Not this one."
Gotta make moves, not a ton of moves, tryna keep it simple
This summer
Said you didn't wanna go with me
That's a bumma, bumma, bumma, yeah
Boppin' at Bacchus, that was the first parade
Bounce remixes of Aaliyah had the spinal cords crackin', crackin'
Cups of methazine had 'em lean like Michael Jackson
Yeah
And you was fuckin' with your nose trying to be a Jackson
Oh yeah
Poolside convo, about your summer last night

[Intro]
Now, to the edge I'll race
To the end I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my faux friends
We pour a taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The height right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now
That might be what you need

[Verse]
What it means to be alive on this side
(Said you wanna kill me now)
On this side
(Don't let me down)
On this side
(Down, down)
Fuck the other side
I'm on this side, I'm on this side, I'm on this side
How it feels to have arrived
I'm inside, I'm inside
Those are my niggas for life
Mothers of us be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us be kind
To the mothers on whom we rely
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah

[Outro]
We know you're sugar
We know you're sweet like a sucka
Pretty sweet, pretty sweet



[Verse 1]
Yeah, bring an amp up here
Let me plug my guitar in
I wanna play for you baby
Can you hear me?
Oh, it's a sold out crowd
I'm kind of nervous
And they yellin' my name out
Can you hear 'em?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, I would cancel if I could (woah, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
You said if I loved you then I would

[Chorus]
Make it a private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closin', doors are closin', doors are closin'
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that
VIP, backstage pass and all that

[Verse 2]
I really love my fans
So we gotta move quickly
And once I finish here
Don't shout out encore
You can sing along to my songs, and then
Then I'll applaud you, and then

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, I would cancel if I could (woah, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
You said if I loved you then I would

[Chorus]
Make it a private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closin', doors are closin', doors are closin'

Said you want a private show, said you want a private show

Memo finna start acting out if I don't see him soon
Yeah my best friend ain't backing out, it's still on sight, fool
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
Trophy case still light, body need a race stripe
And these minerals on my body break light

Is you a natural blondie like Goku?
Sleepin' on my belly in a loop like a serpent
Talking Heads ripplin' on the surface

Provided, diamond lane that didn't exist
Packed the Astro van and brought my kids through
Prada tee on the eldest, throw the Gildan on the children
Hand-me-down fits
Chest pass, see mist off rotation (Swish, swisha)
Stiff smile just like I'm Aphex Twin (Yeah, come to daddy, yeah)
Pat the Patagonia pockets, tryna find my zip (uh, where it's at? Yeah)
Blunt twist, tightropes, I'm not fallin' off (never that, no)
Watch friends, go pro through fisheye lens, drownin' off clear

Been feelin' like the Lord just out of reach for me (for me)

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
I've been busy (Busy, busy)
I've been fuckin' busy, I've been busy fuckin'
I've been all kinds of busy, or sorta kinda busy
Like shorty is we fuckin'? Well if not then fuck it
Apologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em
Said I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'
It's busy shit, busy that, busy this
And I need a minute (Hold on)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, A$AP Rocky, and Frank Ocean]
See this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ooh, going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (I'm going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violins on the floor
Fast forward, linings on my skull
This the type of design I could afford
Fast forward, bands out
Got they hands out like they acknowledgin' the Führer
I rewind, Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense
Just like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me
Raw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass
Pour it in foam, this white got eggshells in my omelet
My earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck
Woof, woof—dogs in the place, loose tooth—lost in the fray
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rozay, brute force, Brüt champagne
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable slow, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth, chewing on nothing
You're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'
You're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you’re overthinkin'
One blink and I'm pre-cummin'
That could turn every no one into someone
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Frank Ocean and  A$AP Rocky]
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ohh, do do, do do, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
I just need peace of mind for my purity
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky and Lauryn Hill]
Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keepin' me up and focused
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
NY throwback like the old Fab
"I'm undone because"
Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
Hold up, hold that (Hold on, my nigga, hold that—) thought
Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough, tryna hold back
The call had dropped when the FaceTime paused, don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco
Saint like Joan of Arc, bro, ring barcode
Two of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face-to-face with my demons at a barstool
Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost nothin' since September
Last seen her September '16
Man it feels like
"I'm undone because"
Lose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me (A$AP)
Press is gone and I grief, I share with you my peace
[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
"I'm undone because—"
"I'm undone because—"

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They have taken Cleopatra

[Bridge]
Run run run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra)
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cleopatra)

[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids, tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

[Hook]
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

[Outro]
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Part II]

[Segue]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

[Verse 2]
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid

Working at the pyramid, that's right
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah

[Verse 1]
Babe, just say you miss me, is it that hard?
Too long since I've heard about our love
Am I in this by myself? Hey yeah
With rose colored lenses on my store bought frames
To see something other than these blues and grays
I need something different, hey yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you ain't feeling the same

[Hook]
Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat, yeah
Cubic's from genuine diamond, yeah
A call from the woman who loves you and hello from a friend
I know when it's real, I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh I know when it's real

[Verse 2]
Oh, I can tell the difference every time that you call
But I don’t need a drink I need some time in my car
Time to drive and think, time to park and cry
You shoulda known you were beautiful
You shoulda known what I saw in you, yeah
Please forgive me for feeling like it’s all your fault
A heavy heart can’t carry blame for the loss
[Hook]
Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat, yeah

I know when it's real, I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh I know when it's real

[Verse 3]
You might not know this but I’m a man with pride
And this hurts me baby deep down, deep down
I can’t let go of this, gotta know I tried
It’s pathetic baby don’t lie, don’t lie
I’m a candle, you’re the sun
And you’re burning baby, you're burning baby
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up, burning up, yeah

rivke asked: some background on that pic (from wiki): In March 1993, while on a trip to Sudan, Carter was preparing to photograph a starving toddler trying to reach a feeding center when a vulture landed nearby. Carter later said that he waited 20 minutes to see if the vulture would flare its wings. He finally took a picture and then chased off the vulture. However, he came under criticism for failing to help the girl:
The St. Petersburg Times in Florida said this of Carter: "The man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her suffering, might just as well be a predator, another vulture on the scene."
Sold to the New York Times, the photograph first appeared on March 26, 1993. Hundreds of people contacted the newspaper to ask the fate of the girl. The paper reported that it was unknown whether she had managed to reach the feeding center. In 1994, the photograph won Pulitzer Prize.
Carter later committed suicide. This photograph raises issue about photographers and their relationship to their subjects.
just sad, all the way around.

Money we'll be seeing
Er'day we turn up
Money we'll be seeing
Money,money we'll be seeing
Money,money we'll be seeing

If you love life put a hand up
Know some times you may break down
All in all and everything is cool
When you make moves and you paint towns
Have good drinks with good friends
When the city's borin' you take trips
They'll go with you to the end and back
And then catch you if you may slip
And then help you get back up
Reach for the stars and find your peak
Many nights of that great work
All I got was some bad sleep
But for all the nights that I stayed up
These the moments we prayed of
The ones that thought we wouldn't make it
Finally get to see what we made of
We paid up

[Verse 1]
I heard my teacher say that I’d be better off
If I just took what I’ve been given
They said I never know what to do
Unless I’m told
I feel underestimated, So unaccounted for
Then you want to call me to your office right after school
And tell me your version of my future

[Hook]
But let’s take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don’t talk me out of it
Don’t talk me out of it
It’s my life, Don’t talk me out of my life
It’s my life

[Verse 2]
I used to put an apple on Ms. Jacob’s desk
But she never liked me
She said I’m gon’ fail, no matter what I give
She said ’cause my skin wasn’t light enough
Tuition wasn’t high enough
I couldn’t understand just what I did
So underestimated, You left me unaccounted for
Now you want to call me to your office right after school
And now you wanna tell me, your version of my future

[Hook]
But let’s take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don’t talk me out of it
Don’t talk me out of it
It’s my life, Don’t talk me out of my life
It’s my life

[Bridge]
Just tell me how
You’re much better than me now
You tore me down till there was nothing left
Look at me, Look at me, Look at me, Look at me
I’m still standing
Look at me
Look at me now, Look me in my eyes

[Hook]
But let’s take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don’t talk me out of it
Don’t talk me out of it
It’s my life, Don’t talk me out of my life
It’s my life

[Verse 1]
Ever since you came into my life I been moving closer to
Tryna' build a vault around the both of us
When you're gone baby I ain't cool
No I ain't cool no, I can't move
And I don't know what the hell is happening to us
But I don't wanna know because it feels like something that I want
And baby I ain't never fell in love but if this is what they talk about then I don't ever wanna get up
They say it's infatuation
I say I don't care what you name it

[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

[Verse 2]
No I don't care who wants to question us or break us up
Cos' I'd lose a thousand friends for what I got wit you
Right here baby I'm all good, yup, I'm all good, ah
I'm all good, oh
And I don't want nothing but your heart and trust
Every little tender touch
And I know love ain't only made for us but I feel like we own it
Feel like we own it
And I already know what they say, they swear that we will never make it
But if I lost you today it'd be real just the same
[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

[Bridge]
Oh I know it all can't be just a figment of imagination
A dream that won't come true
I know it all can't be just and illusion
I know what you're doing to me

[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love

Let’s just get that out of the way.

Club culture around late 70s and 80s nightlife in NYC was a special, much talked about and written about thing. From the star studded midtown clubs like studio 54 and the first danceteria to the downtown clubs like Mudd + paradise garage. The figures, the music, the looks, the lack of regulation haha. I recognize NY wasn’t all lasers and disco lighting and that simultaneously, there was a lot of crime and poverty and that a huge part of club culture, the gay community, at that time were being wiped out by HIV + AIDS. Now in 2019, there’s a pill you can take every day that will at a better than 90% chance prevent you from contracting HIV. This pill was approved by the FDA in 2012. The pricing strategy behind it is malicious in my opinion and so it’s public perception is marred and rightfully so. But the fact remains that despite price being a very real barrier to this potentially life saving drug for some, the other very real barrier is awareness. I decided to name, what was otherwise going to be a night of lights and music inspired by an era of clubbing that I loved PrEP+ because while designing the club which is inside of an old glass factory basement in Queens (shoutout to The Basement that runs a very awesome techno night on Fridays after us) I started to imagine in an era where so many lives were lost and so much promise was lost forever along with them, what would it have been like if something, anything had existed that in all probability would’ve saved thousands and thousands of lives. I’m an artist, it’s core to my job to imagine realities that don’t necessarily exist and it’s a joy to. A couple days before we threw the party, I was discussing this subject with my team and one of the architects I work with thought that PrEP as a drug had reached ‘100% saturation’ so far as awareness. I thought he was dead wrong so I asked a friend (who I won’t name haha) if he knew what PrEP was and his response was ‘isn’t that some type of viagra or something’. My ex who I was with for several years didn’t know about it when we first met at a gay club in LA. Awareness isn’t always what we’d hope it would be. But anyway, I’m ranting. I’m happy that folks are talking about the subject in the first place. Thank you to everyone who came out and danced with us last night. Y’all were beautiful and the energy was right! Thank you Bouffant Bouffant, Sango, Justice and Sherelle for your sets last night they were soo good man. Oh one more thing, I saw someone say that this was a PR stunt etc etc, pshhh bitch pls come get a drink next time and I’ll put several barstools out so you can have as many seats as you need. All my love everybody really. Stay safe.

Excuses are the tools of the weak and incompetent. They build bridges to nowhere and tunnels to nothingness…. Those who excel in them seldom do in anything else, therefore there are no excuses.

ok ken (and david). as much as i hate to make you guys famous or even respond to you directly. we all die one day and you’re old so fuck it. yea yea my 2013 performance at the grammys was absolute shit. technical difficulties, blah blah. thanks for the reminder. very much appreciated. fuck that performance though. you think that’s why i kept my work out of the grammy process this year? don’t you think i would’ve wanted to play the show to ‘redeem’ myself if i felt that way? in reality, i actually wanted to participate in honoring prince on the show but then i figured my best tribute to that man’s legacy would be to continue to be myself out here and to be successful. winning a tv award doesn’t christen me successful. it took me some time to learn that. i bought all my masters back last year in the prime of my career, that’s successful. blonde sold a million plus without a label, that’s successful. i am young, black, gifted and independent.. that’s my tribute. i’ve actually been tuning into cbs around this time of year for a while to see who gets the top honor and you know what’s really not 'great tv’ guys? 1989 getting album of the year over to pimp a butterfly. hands down one of the most 'faulty’ tv moments i’ve seen. believe the people. believe the ones who’d rather watch select performances from your program on youtube the day after because your show puts them to sleep. use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, i’m one of the best alive. and if you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then i’m all for it. have a good night.

i was raised christian. only had a few friends from different religions growing up. these days i’ve got family from agnostic to islam. my grandmother was pentecostal evangelical. she brought much of that fire and brimstone back to her household. my uncle tony said the other kids teased him and his siblings, called them “holyrollers”. so as you may or may not expect, my mother was, and still is, less than imposing when it comes to a particular system of belief. i was a practicing catholic for a short time. me and moms started going to separate churches when i was like 13. i never sang or played in the church though, unfortunately. i remember being kind of intimidated by the idea of it actually. church was the hood julliard to me. all the coldest musicians came out of there. the lady in the video…summa cum laude.

[Verse 1]
Got a heart full of gold, that I own
The clothes on my back and a pencil
I can draw my own money
You wouldn’t even tell the difference
But I just can’t sketch the feeling
I get when you’re not home
Or recreate the paintings
You’ve hung onto my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh but I bet they’re worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I’m a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can’t tell me nothing, nothing

[Chorus]
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

[Verse 2]
She got a heart made of glass
What’s inside of it's like lightning in a bottle
Now what would that be worth in your museum
Recently we traded
And now that hearts my own
And since we’re sewed together
I feel like I got both

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and I bet they’re worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I’m a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can’t tell me nothing, nothing

Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got

I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

[Bridge]
Time itself wants what I got
So I don’t care about what you’ve got
All I know is my girl is precious
You make me better, baby
You make me happy, baby
Nobody needs to remind me exactly why I’m
The richest man in the room

[Chorus]
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you

Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you

[Intro]
We in the studio
I said, we in the studio
Is this mic on? Check, check

[Verse 1]
I'm thankful for my position I was given in life
Cause I know some people living who ain't living this life
Read about starved children who ain't eating this right
Drug lords declare war, selling cheaper the price
Stunting dummy drug money, yeah them sneakers is nice
Get your swag from the blacks selling bags of the white
Niggas can't get a job, so we self-employed
If the coppers come a-knocking, we gon' help that boy
Bail money, welcome back home out of jail money
White girl pale money, sunny when we sell money
See seashell money, we sell money
Rain, hail money, heaven what the hell money
Dusty paper, stale money, I thought they restricted it
Did for most people but we out here getting it

[Hook]
Bunch of hands under her dress, we get the feeling that she's faded
And she's willing screaming Wolf Gang, whip me off, get me off
The sex, it turns to children, then the children turn to villains
Villain wolves screaming kill them all, fuck 'em all
And that go for anybody that come around here, that ain't from around here
Ho, you too, you ain't special, Wolf Gang kill them all, fuck 'em all
[Verse 2]
She handles herself with class
She got a nice ass but she can't run no games on me
She claim to like the stores and the clothes
Jeans bleached with the holes, but she can't get my bank homie
Too smart is no good, if she smart for no good
It's so good, she can't flaunt her thing on me
She can be full of swag, drive a Jag
Poppin' tags on the Ave but she can't get her cake from me
That sounded like the hook I threw at her and the swag I reeled her in
Said she came to feel me in, when she really came to fill me in
Like baby what's the deal with it? Seem to be attracted
By the fiancee and finance that no wifey concealin' it
Dealin' with life's shuffle, then fold
Dippin' with the duffles I hold, if we are a couple, let's go
To the place where we lead in the life to some sleep
Bring the pipe, blow the weed, punchlines to be received

[Intro: Sample]
"Three minutes forty five seconds and counting, we are still a go at this time"

[Verse 1]
Listening to Star Trek’s star tracks
On the track to stars and back
Only after we get to the end

Passing planets feeling small
On the mattress floating off
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl

[Climb]
But you look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

[Hook]
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh

"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"

[Verse 2]
The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, Big bang, look at what we made beautiful

[Climb]
But you look good in that spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

[Hook]
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh

[Verse 3]
We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this eclipse oohh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no

[Hook x2]
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh

T minus 15 seconds, guidance is internal
12, 11, 10, 9, ignition sequence start
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, all engines running
Lift off, we have a lift off, lift off"

Listening to star trek, star tracks
On the track, starting back only after we get to the end
Parts and planets, feeling small
All the matches floating off
Help me breathe in out here tonight
Nothing new, nothing old, baby girl
But you look good in a space suit
I can’t keep my hands off you
Plus, it’s easy to love you up here, up here

I’mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We’ll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket love

The candle’s burning in the sun
We don’t need them but you lie, girl
They glow, they glow
Oh yeah, we were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, big bang, look at what we made beautiful
You look good in a space suit
I can’t keep my hands off you
‘Cause it’s easy to love you up here, up here

I’mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We’ll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket love
We could make believe that we’re up there
But we’re only in the backseat of this secret, so
If the lights go by that means the cops flew by
But they won’t bother us
No, no, no, no

I’mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We’ll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket love
I’mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We’ll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket loveIt's another day in Los Angeles
Beverly Hills to be exact
Today, I decide to take my new Rolls-Royce Wraith
I leave my multimillion dollar mansion and blend in with the morning LA traffic
Usually being in traffic is not a pleasant experience
But when you drive a 260 plus thousand dollar car with a 6.6 liter twin turbo V-12, a 13 thousand dollar starlight headliner option, and complete sound isolation from the outside,
It's kinda hard to pay attention to what happens outside
I stop at a red light
Holding  the bespoke hand-stitch leather steering wheel with one hand
And adjusting the air conditioning to a cool 68 degrees
And I notice this guy in a third gen Honda Civic
He's staring at me
As soon as our eyes cross,
He looks else where
But I can see the look on his face
He's jealous
He wants a car like mine
His girlfriend is sitting right next to him
Pretending to look at her phone
But she is actually taking a picture of my car
I bet he told her to do so
The light goes green and I flow past them
Reaching 60 miles per hour in a mere 4.1 seconds
Not bad for something which costs as much as your house
I get to my destination in complete comfort
As it's always the case when you drive a Rolls-Royce
But to look good,
Its gotta be the latest model
Can't be seen driving around in a series 1 Phantom with the wrong fog lights
I mean,
You can buy those for less than a hundred grand,
That's like,
What I spent in two weeks

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you
Who else gon' believe in you? Who else gon' believe in you?
Believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you?
Who else gon' believe in you, who else gon' believe in you?

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Who else?
I knew all this back on the Shaw
When I had no bedrooms at all
Now it's tears in a wraith feeling soft
Now I'm based like I'm lost at a rave
Really miss my landaulet
Look at the stars, it's a plane
This plane right here cost me bank
That Bentley truck ugly, I'm straight
It's straight, but that's just not my style
That's just not my style
When Sage pushed it mongo
Way before the Uber
Was stranded as fuck at the house
We just landed we scuffing the ground
We been knew the earth was around
These goofies ain't looking for Mickey
They looking for mini me, copy my style
Copies is selling and I don't know why
Mostly I cockblock myself on the pop
400k I could spend it on lots
Can't pay for play Christmas day no Xbox
Last Christmas Day was in LA with Flack
Pourin' this red, sky gettin' blue
We couldn't tell if it's IMAX or not
Butterfly hinges on a cocoon
[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors go dat way, doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors, Wraith, my doors, uh

[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

[Verse 1: Nas]
A known fraud once fell on his own sword
Scrawny as a fiend, he'll tell on his own broad
His lady's crazy and it bugs me
Behind her best friend back, she call her best friend baby ugly
Less then a week ago
He's beatin' his dick to a freak he know
Talkin' dirty to him on speakerphone
Right before he clinked up, his girl creeped up
Swung a knife, hit his cheekbone, made a deep cut
He holdin' his face, he out the door
She yellin' out the window, "You can stay with that whore"
Hours went past, stitched up with the gauze
Gettin' drunk by the store, smokin' blunts with some more
Fraud ass niggas who like to front and big talk
Never swung at nobody, never let a gun spark
Big nine-seven Benz with the old body
Pulls up to the corner, out jumps his old hottie
[Chorus: RaVaughn and Nas]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty (Nigga)
But they gon' know when they see us (Yo)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Football wives, basketball wives
Mistresses slash more tires with knives
They lookin' for a dollar
I'm lookin' for a JoAnne Chesimard to turn to a shotta
Spot a King of Diamonds, Onyx, one bitch get it off the floor
Other chick out of her man's pockets
What kind of shows you be watchin'?
It shows, this is how we choose who we should rock with
I think about settlin' down again, have more seeds
Ten toes on the ground again, let hoes be
Nothin' like makin' love with somebody you love
Nothin' like comin' home to grub
Netflix, hugs with a wet kiss
The best shit, take my mind off of makin' records
I need that moral support
Give me a reason to spoil you more
Make 'em jealous of who we are
[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

[Verse 3: Nas]
Tryna get my niggas legitimate
Shit is ugly, my dudes strugglin', drug dealer shit
Silhouette of a murderer, thug nigga, fitted Mets cap
Drunk liquor bit, young black militant
Just hopin' I hit a lick, a criminal's wit
Intelligence, still a menace each Guinness I sip
Bring the kid ideas, the visions I get
How this dude rich? He snuck in with no citizenship
Motivation, so I get off my ass
I'm the star of the movie, lookin' for my supportin' cast
Read the Forbes pages, lookin' at G4s
Wish it could be more, pray I beat the court cases
Women with small waists, lonely, I ain't too far
Smoke weed, and count paper
I'm about paper and pussy and buyin' the bar
Fly ass niggas, y'all jealous of who we are
[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

[Verse: Frank Ocean and James Sullivan]
Gonna be somebody, oh I follow
Oh and it's so cloudy
Running showers and the mist so fly
Enough time to know, know nothing at all
Oh I see the lines, there's two lines (walls)
You'll live a life anew
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, to be kind
You cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
Its a rush to the head
We've been here before (It's just like the water)
The first time is not the past time
I ain't felt this way in years
First, I was rushing for a wait
This time I'm waiting for a rush
(Oh, help me up off my feet)
Infatuation's your rush
(Help me, help me, help me off my feet, yeah
Do you....)
Keep pushing on 'em, never let 'em stop
All that happens to be, what happens to me, upon his feet
Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off and on
Bygones but we're still here, ride around in my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel
(What happens to me)
Bet you wish you was me
(You, just you and me)
(I need some help on my feet)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be up to my feet
I wake up feeling weak
Wake me up in a week
It don't matter
It don't matter, pipe it down
Two is a crowd, quieting down
[Outro: Frank Ocean]
What stays and what- what's gone and what's here still
And what's here still
Riding my two wheels
They're gone and you're still here, rid-
They're gone and you're still here, riding my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel





[Verse 1]
Turn a lamp on
Let me talk to you
See that light bulb, does something to you
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don't it?
Make it difficult to run and hide don't it?
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
Come close to me if that's you
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
The lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

[Chorus]
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

[Verse 2]
Just turn the lamp down
Don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Or gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
Took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blend in, too perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful lies

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirror oh you're so unfair to all of the beautiful ones

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark

I'm scared for you

Scared of beautiful

[Verse 1]
Turn the lamp on, let me talk to ya
See that light bulb, does something to ya
Makes it little harder, to tell a lie don't it
Make it difficult, to run and hide don't it
Told your truth to me, the truth to me
Come close to me, if that's you
I wanna see the details
Inside those beautiful eyes (Beautiful eyes)

[Pre-Chorus]
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before
And I wonder
What on earth is he searching for

[Chorus]
No wonder why
There's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why
Your so terrified of beautiful

Scared of the good
More than the evil
Scared of the light

Scared of a truth so much more than a lie
I'm scared for me
I'm scared of me
Scared of beautiful
[Verse 2]
Turn the lamp down, don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
I took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blame him to perfect
All this beauty ever came
It was reason for some beautiful life

[Pre-Chorus]
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before
And I wonder
What on earth is he searching for

Who's the fairest of them all

The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (brave)
I'm not brave

[Verse 2]
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views (nice views)
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell (It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do?
(And the other side of the loop is a loop)
This, this fe-, this feel
This feel, this feels
This feels how molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel, this feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel

This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (brave)

[Verse 3]
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot

[Verse 4]
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon (In the dark)
[Outro]
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you

I'd do anything for you

I'd do anything for you

I'd do anything for you, anything for you

Maybe I'm a fool (?)
Maybe I should move

Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (Denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (Black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (On the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (Brown cock)
Last night I slept over hers (Over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler, The Creator]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window

Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time

Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)

[Verse 1]
Her state of mind is constantly changing
To hell and back
She drives, switching lanes
Not knowing what she has til she knows where she's going
If she can just get past this traffic
She tries and tries to find peace of mind
But these days everything's in your face
So she stays soul and in her mind
Blowin' smoke in the sky
Cause it's her only vice
I wonder why

[Hook]
She blows smoke in the air, in the air, in the air
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

She shaved off all of her hair, of her hair, of her hair
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no
[Verse 2]
Some people seem to think she needs changing
They don't know the struggles that she was raised with
So shut the fuck up
Just shut the fuck up
Stop thinking that you know everything
You don't and you never will, so just let it go
And be free as long as you're kind and and you've been born with the fight
So don't wonder why

[Hook]
She blows smoke in the air, in the air, in the air
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

She shaved off all of her hair, of her hair, of her hair
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

My best friend
What was cooler than us?
Whole school already knew what it was
Kiddy crushing, puppy loving, no
Ah, you are my high school wifey
College made it different
I stayed at home and you didn't
You got a scholarship to Michigan State
Drove my heart two-thousand miles away

[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't
[Verse 2]
My best friend, wish I could have went with her
Can't afford to visit her
Let alone stay
But I wanna, I really wanna
Oh, we did everything together, now I'm missing all the silly shit
The way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed
I'm x-ing off the calendar days
I'm praying, oh, you come back again

[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her

[Bridge]
My baby (baby), what am I to do without her?
Whoa I've been losing patience calling her
[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't

[Verse 1]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Woah)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin' (Fightin')
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Yeah)
Clips on clips like Mike (Hello)
It's really all

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

[Outro]
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home

[Intro]
Woo! (Woo, woo)
Woo!

[Verse]
I was in all them hours in it
10K, tokin' mid strokes
Prime prime time of my life witcha
Puttin' prime numbers up though
On them 777 flights witcha
Take a shower with it, gotta cleanse it
Keep the safety off innit
Now we finna have a mini
Outta wedlock, God forgive it
Then forget it
'Cause only God can forget it
All this hotel living
Might as well pay the mortgage what I'm spending
Said the dick long as a swan neck
Put some real swans in the pond then
Fell asleep in the foreign
After the free show at the Garden
Let the LED roll, deer hunter
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Bet we sell the biggest out next week
On me on, my partners
[Outro]
When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm sideways, yeah, I set me straight
When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm down they gon' celebrate
Sittin' sideways, too sideways
Nah, it's not too late

[Verse 1]
(We're spendin' too much time alone)
Spendin' too much time alone
(And I just ran outta Trojans)
Horses gallop to her throne
(We're behaving like teenagers)
We're behaving like teenagers
(Making less than minimum wage)
Still inside our parents' homes
(No, I don't live in Denver)
No, I don't live in Denver
(I grew up in Sierra Leone)
And her pink skies will keep me warm
Sierra Leone
Sierra Leone

[Verse 2]
Tid bits of intuition that I be gettin' abandon mission
(Sierra Leone)
Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different
Shit feelin' too good to me
Glistening, shimmerin' underneath the sunlight, the sunlight
(Sierra Leone)

[Outro]
And a new day will bring about the dawn
And a new day will bring another crying babe into the world
(Girl now)
Our daughter's reaching for your nipple 'cause it's time for her to eat (Reaching for ya)
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle if it's time to go to sleep (Oh, go to sleep, oh, oh)
I'll sing a Lennon lullaby, she can have a pretty dream
Baby girl, if you knew what I know, knew what I know
[Outro]
Na, na na, na na, na...
Na, na na, na na, na...

[Intro]
It's simple, so simple

[Verse 1]
These hands that I pray with for just one more chance
They also took off the dress of that woman
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems
A simple, simple mistake
Simply made it so hard for you to love me

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Interlude]
My mother said "son, don't break her heart
And staying in love won't be so hard, it's simple"

[Verse 2]
These same lips that once said I love you, I do, I do
Admitted, they kiss her over and over and over
Simple man, couple simple problems
One simple, simple mistake
Simply made it hard for you to love me
[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Bridge]
I wish I could've simply say I'm sorry, baby ooooh
I wish you'd say you simply can't fall out of love with me
Then maybe we could move one (cause I really can't)
Move on (I gotta)
Get on (I gotta)
Get on with our hearts
With ours lives, cause they're simply too short
Without love

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Verse 1]
This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your metal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
'Til God strikes us
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fucking, underneath moonlight now
Pretty fucking, sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, haze)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication
Strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you come when I call again?

[Verse 2]
On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
Piece in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away
Because I'm stronger and the Congo is dim (smoke)
In comes the morning (smoke)
In comes the morning (haze)

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D (Star Trak)
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, (what?) now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Me? I'm from the slums, niggas who push a ton
Ton of drums, with foul flow, dirty mouth, like kissing bums
Mama done made her one, um, a witty son
With no respect for women, so show me your titties hun (what?)
You eighteen? Me? I'm twenty-somethin'
OK, I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit, it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, "Should he come?"
I'ma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, um, that mac and cheese
New 'Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics ("How's your dick?") Shit, how's your knees?
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee
I came up with ''Rella'', ain't touch a bag of weed
Shit was doper than Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, ay
Getting T.U., O.F., indeed
We was missing Sweatshirt, like "Where's the hooded sleeve?"
Okay, nevermind, we found him, yeah
[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Guess I win, checks started cashing in
I stop rapping and start asking where my fucking passion is
Probably where that faggot went (who?) Tyler talking father problems
Shocking shit, he spit to popping topics in them gossip columns
I ain't ask for this, I did it out of boredom
Thought that roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom
Now; Ye's, PJs, sipping leche
Chips Ahoy, boy, listening to "Cowboy", ay!
Boy, land in Melbourne and skate to Fitzroy, ay!
AUS was awes', I enjoyed, boy
Y'all niggas played as a tot's toy
Have a good day as I annoy, oi

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Canons with panorama views
My shoes that seen more vans than Mexicanas
Or crackers in Alabama
G-O-to-the-L-F, this OF
I opened up a store so I don't stress
But nigga, I (what?) mosh in gardens
Jazz punk shit, playing chords
Making up shit, pardon my Dolly Partons
And I keep shartin'
Hoodies with rectangles and different colors
Niggers think I started kindergarten

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Frank Ocean & Both]
My bitch is on my handle bars
I, just, wanna, ride, my bike
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
Hair blowing in the wind
My bitch is on my handle bars

Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (Uh)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Put that spotlight on her face (Spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (Ah, yeah)

And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good lord

[Verse 3: Offset]
(Offset!) Good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out a spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia (Info)
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo
She havin' it, went to college, workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average (M's)
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it (Skrr)

With the top gone, won't turn up the stereo (stereo)
Singing every word of my song that's on radio (aye)

Sit back, let your mind float (phew) never give up hope (no)
And if ya got a problem, let me know (let me know)

But y'all know (but y'all know)

[Intro]
Gotta rinse off here
I can't see your diamonds
I need a week paradise
I went god mode all year
I can't see so cloudy
Paradiso laundries
I keep the cheats on all year
Sometime in Heaven
You still behind like ancestor
All on your mood board all year
I went god mode about it
You ain't got no muscles, lil' nigga
I ain't in the mood for it all year
I keep the cheats on always
Wrong side of average

[Chorus]
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on or peace out on me, yeah, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, ohh, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
For your mentality
You play ball, you run 5 on 5 least three times a week
Glen Park down the street
Waitin' on you to tire, retire with victory
Play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose you don't cry but you lowkey sad to see
If we cut like some champions you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-haha, smiling
I'm still working while you dream pop
I could never let a scene stop smilin' on me
I don't think they get the point pop
They forgettin' that it's me, akh
Akhi tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day running numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall
They're like "something's gotta give"
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather
If you ain't in the streets you can't see the sky, I'm out here
I could see the sky and it's paradise
On the regular
[Chorus]
And when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on, ohh slide, yeah, yeah
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
First time on me, ohh, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way
This is for that night when setbacks won't let that much fade
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
See you peepin' out the peep hole
Gamblin' with your life, nigga, Cee-Lo
Three stripes and they're all green gold
Three strikes in a row mean go
And you die slow, oh
Nigga, die slow
I screamed when I saw the titties on Janet Jackson
I'm screamin' from the top of the planet
They first saw my swag, they was laughin'
But my bitch bad, she leavin' damage
I'm higher than a mothafuckin' ladder
I'm ballin', I'm ballin' on all you scrubs
Got you ridin' in your foreign, you livin' it up
Front's 21's and the back's on them dubs
Jeffery got a mink on, he look like a cub
Ridin' in the Rozay away from the world
Oasis on and I'm feelin' a grudge
Oasis on when I'm seein' you girl
Oasis on and I'm seein' the dust
Oasis on and I'm feelin' like water
Oasis on when I'm servin' the plugs
Oasis on when I'm servin' these drugs
Off white molly, I sniff it off her
All of y'all on hold on while I tangle my buzz
All white hoes puttin' dick in their guts
All type of hoes puttin' dick in their guts
Bad black hoes, they drinkin' the cum
Told her when she cum I wanna drink a lil' some
Molly bite down, man, I need me some gum
Cop me a Sudan I'ma gon' turn up a bomb
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on peace out, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Gold chain and some J’s like Nas in Illmatic
I’m so real, I’m something to feel, peel fabric
My folks kill, they hunt every meal, meat cabbage
Lyrically get out my way, protein the beats radish
Roll the weed LB the police smell me
High profile, sweet, bring them hoes to the tele Nah
Bitches fuck your shit up words from DMX in Belly behind you back
Planning your downfall, I thought that was your relly-
Relative, skin of ribs and eat healthy
I belch a bitch and leave her tits on a shelving
I felt a bitch, she let me in, welcoming
Fuck duct tape nigga, I like Velcro-ing
I ain’t the one to be tampered with
I make you shit all in your pants and your pamper, bitch
Niggas quick to sing a hook and make a dance up quick
For you it’s never or never, my camp’s legit

Smoke up, Left Brain!

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Snow so white, moon so bright
They’re on a playground making canines fight
Ain’t no place for my kids to go
[Verse 2]
The wolves are rowdy and in the parking lot
I don’t mean basketball when I say that they be balling in the park a lot
It’s like the big bad wolf duplicated
If they getting shitted on by critics, it’s cool, they super rated
Life on the huge and playlist, daily’s the fucking basis
Accounting for all the hatred, get off the children’s sacred
I’m international, actual but in fact I go from
The US to the UK to Amsterdam in like two days

[Hook]
Snow so white, moon so bright
They’re on a playground making canines fight
Ain’t no place for my kids to go

[Verse 1]
I'm afraid to say it
Don't wan't you to think I'm playing
My mistakes take the pretentiousness down like I’m standing naked in a crowd
And I'm sorry I know that I’m wrong, yeah, I’m wrong
If I could I'd go back I’m exposed give me back my clothes cause I just can’t take it
But look at you, loving a fool, making it easy
I guess its cool naked with you already seen me

[Chorus]
Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I’m wrong, comfortable
You don’t mind them flaws, you’ve already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable

[Verse 2]
You keep on forgiving
Rewrote all my wrongs in pencil
When you stay it makes me forget that I’m down, now it’s all so simple
'Til the end, even when, I look dumb like I do when I lie
Feels so good letting go, I’m exposed, you can have my clothes cause I’m not afraid
But look at you loving a fool, making it easy
I guess it’s cool, naked with you already seen me

[Chorus]
Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I’m wrong, comfortable
You don’t mind them flaws, you’ve already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable
[Bridge]
It don’t matter, it don’t matter no, you’ve seen it all before
It don’t matter, it don’t matter, you’ve seen it all before
It don’t matter, it don’t matter no, you’ve seen it all before
So comfortable, so comfortable, so comfortable

[Chorus]
Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I’m wrong, comfortable
You don’t mind them flaws, you’ve already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable[Intro]
Oh no
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
So fresh (so fresh) oh yes
And I, know I was in love with you
First moment I met you, butterflies
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt
First word that I spoke it made you smile
Cause I got a little style goin'
You laugh in my face but I didn't care
Cause it started the conversation
That led to our first date, now
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt it
I know it's true if, they're, just like you

[Chorus]
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
Each time when I closed my eyes
Fade in and your lips touch mine, oh
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
You're like my favorite
I swear you could play forever...

[Skit: Frank Ocean]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow



[Verse 1]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (solo), solo (solo)
S-solo (solo), s-solo, (solo)

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

[Verse 2]
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

[Outro]
By myself
Solo, solo, solo, solo
(By myself, by myself)
(Solo)

[Intro: André 3000]
Ayy, ayy, so now I'm—

[Verse: André 3000]
So low that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So low that I don't get high no more
When I "Geronimo!," I just go "Heh"
Solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So low that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, ant
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling, this only worsens
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
Don't pay no attention to it
So low that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
Watchin' the summer come close to an end
After twenty years in, I'm so naïve I was under the impression
That everyone wrote they own verses
It's comin' back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
I've stumbled and lived every word
Was I working just way too hard?That's right. Now tell these motherfuckers, um, what the house warming party gone feel like. 'Cause I feel like we need it to be about, umm, large picture, wide-frame, panoramic views, and above 78 degrees, 'cause we don't do that cold shit. This is for the sun-lit motherfuckers in the building, this is for the bitches who like to wear, um, nothing but skin and,-and-and loose fitting things, like a sundress. This is for motherfuckers who like, uh, shit that ain't sepia but that's bronze like a motherfucking, uh, tan you can't get from a bottle, you broke bitch. This is for blonde, uh-uh, nature walks and shit. This is for that blonded bitch.

How would you have learned if I ain’t leave?

But I let you get mad disrespectful, huh
Couldn't be serious nigga was you?
Looking at my new man, wish it was you?
But you're dead now
Sign of the cross on ya chest and ya head now
Guilty is what you pled now
Left Queens, hit Brooklyn, I'm on a belt now
Stupid is what you felt now
When you see me on TV, have a meltdown

How many cars on the drive are actually yours?
You never go out for a ride, you keep them indoors
You got a big big mouth, a big big house
You're the king of cribs right now

A real big hit, no hard shit
I swear that won't change me one bit
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me

Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

The world will still go on without you
The newspapers still talk about you
And if your ever low, pick up the phone
I'll be 'round, don't tell a soul

Cause I'm not you, you're bullet proof
I'm in a crowd and I can't move
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me

Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

Let me in, let me in
Gimme the sunshine all year 'round
Lemme out, lemme out
Gimme it now, hear me out, hear me shout

Gimme the munchies , show me around
Lemme out, lemme out, gimme the reason
Gimme it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Gotta big big house, big big mouth
Big, big, house, big, big mouth
Big, big, house, big, big mouth
That's not helping me right now

Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Haha
When I was younger, I used to wonder, like...

[Verse 1]
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, "Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun"

[Pre-Chorus]
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

[Chorus]
And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Shit, oh well, oh well," ha
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me..."
[Post-Chorus]
You'd be singin' to her
Like, "La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da"

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me

[Chorus]
Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Okay, I don't believe it"
I say "Nope, I swear, I never do it"
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend"
[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah
(Ooh, ooh, ah) Ooh, ah
Yeah
Fair enough

[Bridge]
Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair
But it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half
Ah, ah
I'm singing, "La-da, da-da" ‘bout heartbreak
And now, I'm singing, "La-da, da-da" 'bout love lost

[Break]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Damn
Haha
I'm saying though, like...
All I write is love songs
I mean, I try
I come to the studio
I—you know what I do
What you think I do it for? Huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listening, never
But if you were...
Might bug with it
Haha, yeah
All these songs for women
Songs for women
Songs for you, baby
For you

[Cassettes changing]

Four 4’s I’m tippin’
Wood grain I’m grippin’
Catch me lane switchin’ with the paint drippin’
Turn yo’ neck and your dame missin’
Me & Slim we ain’t trippin’
I’m finger flippin’ and syrup sippin’
Like Do or Die I’m po’ pimpin’
Car stop rims keep spinnin’
I’m flippin’ drop with invisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I’m shakin’ the block with four 18s
Candy green with 11 screens
My gasoline always supreme
Got Doe-Doe the brown with a pint of lean
It takes a grinda to be a king
It takes a grinda to be a king
First round draft pick comin’
Who is Mike Jones? comin’
Slab shining with the grill and woman
Slab shining with the grill and woman
I’m Mike Jones who Mike Jones
The one and only
You can’t clone me
Got a lot a haters and a lot of homies
Some friends and some phony
Back then hoes didn’t want me
Now i’m hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn’t want me
Now i’m hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn’t want me
Now i’m hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn’t want me
Now i’m hot hoes all on me

[First Half]
-goin'
I'm just laughing 'cause you goofy off a [?]
Yeah, got some problems
But you keep on callin' Spaceman
He gon' getcha all the signals
He gon' getcha all the signals

[Second Half]
[?]
The player on the side
Keep it fair, fair
Let them both know that each one is there, there
So my conscious
Be clear where I stay (Stay)

[Verse 1]
I'm standing by your locker
In the hallway after class
Swear I'm amazed, yeah
The drawing in my binder
Every picture I put a halo on your head

[Pre-Hook]
I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

[Hook]
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

[Verse 2]
Saturdays I'm at the snow cone spot
Trying to guess your favorite flavor
I'm thinking cotton candy, maybe
I bought it and I placed it on the table next to me
I wish you could taste it
Cause it's surely melting

[Pre-Hook]
I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

[Hook]
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still

[Bridge]
While the rain storm takes over, outrageous baby
I'll be standing here, seconds forward
I'll take it later, I'll be right there
Oh no, matter what I'll be here
However long

[Hook]
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

[Intro]
They look like twins
That was embarrassing

[Intro]
La da da da daaaa (Okay...cause it never felt like that)
La da da da daaaa ( uh uh... its like)
Ohh (Every touch.. every kiss...static baby)
Ohhh (hahah..yeah)

[Verse 1]
Baby, I don't really know which way to go
It's like your energy keep callin'
I, Im bout to lose my self composure
Even sex has got me braggin'
And You, you look so good
I wish you would give me what Im looking for
Touch is so electric
Got my heart racing. Pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front. I'll be there 1 on 1
And you're the one I want girl

[Hook]
You're like static
It's way beyond me girl, its like magic
Got me feenin' for your touch like an addict. Gotta have it
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would
You're like static
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would

[Verse 2]
And I ain't even playing girl
Theres so much truth in what Im saying girl
You got my head all in it. Like a game of chess baby check me
This ain't no first date. Don't hesitate. No ??
And Ima take it nice and slow, yeah. Take your body where it needs to go
Give me what Im looking for. Touch is so electric
Got my heart racing. Pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front, I need the 1 on 1
You're the one I want, girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Doin' 85 on a freeway. Switchin' lanes in my "range"
GPS is saying next exit. I got your text message
I'm on my way to you. Here's what were gonna do
And girl I'll take it to you. Fit closer, don't stop
Don't mess up the flow. Don't be scared
Touch right there. Make it personal
I don't really know what it is that you do
Its like a force, im stuck onto you like static

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
My baby, my sweet pumpkin pie
My honey, my darling, my love
I only really miss him when he’s gone
Cause when we’re together we argue two thirds of the time
And I miss him more than a fraction when we part

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh you’re calling me crazy
Saying I’m always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You’re packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I’m screaming get out

[Chorus]
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Sugar bunches of oats
My buttered toast on the side
My full serving of love
And then it’s like
Whenever it’s just me and you
You know I don’t wanna fight
But I know that you know my buttons
And when to press them, baby, dammit
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh you’re calling me crazy
Saying I’m always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You’re packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I’m screaming get out

[Chorus]
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Bridge]
I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
You gotta leave
[Verse 3]
Boy, you know I bet the sun won't set
Before we go at it again
It’s just gon’ happen
I don’t understand it
My heart’s sane
But my mind’s going crazy

[Chorus]
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Outro]
I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
I want you to leave
Oh, just go
No stay, go
Stay, go, stay, go, stay

mind is pretty blank right now. i’m sitting in my kitchen listening to age of consent by new order. i like this song.. i fuck with that gwen stefani song ‘cool’ too, i never knew 3000 played keyboards on it- sounds like some teen coming of age movie. i used my birthday week pass to stay in my apartment for too long.. sit still and catch up on some information. i saw that movie ‘glengarry glen ross’ and ‘bottle rocket’, ‘pi’, ‘blackfish’ (sea world is the devil), ‘this is the end’ (hahaha), ‘the purge’(smh), some funny horror movie i forgot the name of ‘…’ . my homie in aussie suggested that i read ‘mr. norris changes trains’.. the writing was really nice. i read ‘the new jim crow’ it made me not fuck with humans for an hour. oh and ‘diffficult men’ which talked about great tv ..dexter, the wire, the sopranos, breaking bad and whatnot. i didn’t watch any news or read it …figured all that shit was gonna happen either way. i’m back to work these days.

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
My money burn
Synonymous to treatment of the fuzzy herb, I keep it G
In places you wishing you and your niggas be
Salute the gang, bitches cheer loud for the winning team
Bring it home, pull it out, break it down, roll it up
Smell it while we rolling down the street, you niggas know it's us
We got that fire, man you niggas know what's up
King Zag papers, Juan the only nigga rolling blunts
Other than that, you lame niggas is wack
Smoking on a J, while I'm smoking on a track
Cliche shit, stay way way far from basic
Kush cologne, I wear mines no K-Swiss
Damn, all I get is high; and brains
From a long-haired mistress preferred skinning light
Prejudice, marijuana evidence
Pipes, bong, vapes got me blown out my element, element

[Hook: Hodgy]
Every single day I smoke (smoke)
Every single day I smoke (I smoke)
Every single day I smoke
Every single day I smoke
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the green sacks)
[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I grasp my intoxication, digital cinema
Third dimension, I can't move, verb suspension
Putting my lips to the purp, hemp burns is tempting
Bitches in the studio and we copped about a quarter
On the phone with her dad, I'm getting high with his daughter
Euphoria, mouth cotton, percent? A hundred
Many places I go or I have went, I'm blunted
Weed, you got it, I want it, I want it if you got weed
T, T-H, H-H, H-C
Out of no eyes, I'm so high, hashish I can provide
In your life, you gotta pick it up, cause I have no ride
When you arrive, I'll be outside loitering
I hate potheads who front like they don't blaze it
Your body needs Mary Jane, nigga, it craves it
I welcome Mary Jane, she doesn't violate
Inhale, exhale, feel the vibe-er-ate

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
When we were kids
We handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious
Then
I'm still kicking
I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting
All the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb
Comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear
I've loved
I've loved the good times here
I've loved our good times here

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Say hello, then say farewell
To the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we?
Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, oh
Even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear
That I have loved
I have loved the good times here
And I will miss our good times here

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Spaceships are lifting off
Of a dying world
And millions are left behind
While the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I
Only you, goodbye
Goodbye

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be grey
Without you, I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time

[Cassette tapes changing]

[Verse 1]
I told her that I missed her, put her on a plane
Goyard luggage, just a product of the fame
I told her that I dug her, I wasn't running game
And if she left a nigga, I wouldn't be the same
She met me at the W, she grabbed me by my chain
Then kissed me like she meant it, so glad she came
Told me she was in love, she wasn't running game
And since she got off the plane, she didn't feel the same

[Pre-Hook]
I made a change for my baby, a difference for love
And I ain't frontin', feel like you were the one
That got the ring, girl if you want
Could have my name, girl if you want

[Hook]
See baby I been looking so long
Feel like you let me shy and wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
Girl I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
If you been searching too long
You knew that it was over, wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
A sucker for love, a sucker for love

[Verse 2]
Summer lovin' in the winter, flaming in the rain
The only one I'm into, never gonna change
Cause when I said I dug her, I wasn't running game
Since she been rocking with me, the crush has been insane
She's a 1 of 1, D color VVS stone
My precious you're my everything, no please don't leave me lone
She told me she was so sprung, I never was a lame
And that the feelings so good, she wish that it would stay

[Pre-Hook]
I made a change for my baby, a difference for love
And I ain't frontin', feel like you were the one
That got the ring, girl if you want

[Hook]
See baby I been looking so long
Feel like you let me show you wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love

You knew that other lover wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love

[Bridge]
Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Oh, love, we did for we did it for love, love, love

[Outro]
See baby looking so long

A sucker for love

[Verse 1]
I seen him buy you a drink
I start kissing ,holding hands
While you're looking at me (at me)
I hope that he don't think that he is the only man
That you getting freaky with (freaky with)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you sleeping at night, she's creeping out
It's not you it's sex that she's worried about

[Chorus]
Why try to cuff her, cuff her

And I'm sorry for you

[Verse 2]
Her body's fierce, she's like scorpion
Her body said get over here
If I knew she had a man
I can't lie, I still would hit it
But I don't really understand
How you blind and you can't see it

[Pre-Chorus]
When you sleeping at night, she's creeping out
It's not you it's sex that she's worried about

[Verse 1]
My right hand to God
Left hand holding the jewels
And I'm swearing up and down
I'm cursing out the moon
Tide stole my youth
The creases in my brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun's burning black and blue
Too cold this side of June

[Refrain 1]
It ain't natural

[Verse 2]
Right hand in yours
Left hand holding the juice
When that jungle flower blooms
Better leave it in the ground
Don't try to cut it out
The creases in your brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun burned black and blue on your green eyes
Too cold this side of June

[Refrain 2]
That ain't natural

[Bridge]
I'll rebel, I'll rebel
But this ain't natural
I'll take care, I'll take care
If this ain't going well
I'm no match for you
This isn't hard to tell
That it ain't going well

[Verse 3]
When we're under the palm trees
Thinking heaven must be
Somewhere under these palm trees
With all the hell we're raising
At least we had the palm trees
To shade us from the ray beams
But not even the palm trees
Could save us from the flames
Summer remains
Oh, summer remains
Oh yeah, summer remain
Summer remain



[Verse 1]
My right hand to God
Left hand holding the jewels
And I'm swearing up and down
I'm cursing out the moon
Tide stole my youth
The creases in my brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun's burning black and blue
It's too cold this side of June

[Refrain 1]
It ain't natural

[Verse 2]
Right hand in yours
Left hand holding the juice
When that jungle flower blooms
Leave it in the ground
Better not cut it out
The creases in your brow ain't (yours)
Saltwater swole my eyes (yours)
The sun burned black and blue on your green eyes (yours)
Too cold this side of June

[Refrain 2]
It ain't natural

[Outro]
(Right hand in yours)
I'll be right (yours)
I'll take (right)
(Yours)
Right (yours)
Right (yours)
Right (yours)
Yours, yours



[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into
And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded, I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
See, it seems that

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like, um

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
I'm coming back, I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
I'll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
When you parade my homecoming, don't cry
You know I can't live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I'd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please, palm, no marijuana trees
Your hickeys on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I'm playing surfboarder, put whiskey in that salt water
I emptied every canteen
Just to wear that straight-edge varsity you think's cool
They called me soft in high school, thank God I'm jagged
Forgot you don't like it rough, I mean, he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean, how anal am I gon' be when I'm aiming my gun?
And why's his mug all bloody? That was a three-on-one
Standing ovation at Staples, I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit, I'm not supposed to be stunting
It's all melodic, this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep, but I'm just jet-lagged is all
And restless

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you's a little different I don't like you a lot
I mean… fuck

[Outro: Both, Frank Ocean, Earl Sweatshirt]
I don't know what we're about
What good is West Coast weather if you're bi-polar?
If I'ma need this sweater, I'd rather be where it's cold
Where it snows, I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls, I know they're coming in droves
You'll only miss when it goes
Yeah, I think that's it
When it goes

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

[Bridge: Beyoncé & (Frank Ocean)]
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, like a bear
A tough love

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower

[Bridge: Beyoncé & (Frank Ocean)]
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Oh, like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, too much to bear
(Superpower)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we got plenty power
Nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down
[Outro: Beyoncé & (Frank Ocean)]
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Close your eyes to what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny-gnashing
Caddy-smashing, bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup

[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
'Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my hand
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce

[Verse 1:]
I didn't notice the signs
You covered both of my eyes
(Mix-match text messages, voicemail evidence)
The audience yellin', "damn, she's blind"
Now it's all so clear
And I was also not scared
(Now I know she missed stunt double skipped on it)
Audience kept yellin', "Not the space

[Pre-Hook:]
I could say that I knew the whole time, but I would be lyin'
You'd have to be a hidden camera, recordin' each take of cryin'
I would say that I would just go to your part, to stop the taping
But the end's here, and I can't change it

[Chorus:]
So I laugh, cuz you think I'm finished
You don't know I've set up an suprise ending
In love, sometimes you don't win it
You just don't go messing up the suprise ending
The suprise ending

[Verse 2:]
You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
(Guess you kept missin' it, homeboys visitin')
The audience yellin', "yeah, that's right"
And now it's not so clear
You don't know how you missed me
Don't buy you were gone
Stopped goin' through your phone
The audience yellin', "'bout damn time"

[Pre-Hook:]
I could say that I knew the whole time, but I would be lyin'
You'd have to be a hidden camera, recordin' each take of cryin'
I would say that I would just go to your part, to stop the taping
But the end is here, and you can't change it

[Chorus:]
So I laugh, cuz you think I'm finished
You don't know I've set up an suprise ending
In love, sometimes you don't win it
You just don't go messing up the suprise ending
The suprise ending

[Bridge:]
Everything was okay when I was the victim
Had me made out to be so naive
Never knew I was workin' on a masterpiece
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah
I worked on my grand finale, yeah
So now as the credits roll
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds

[Chorus:]
So I laugh, cuz you think I'm finished
You don't know I've set up an suprise ending
In love, sometimes you don't win it
You just don't go messing up the suprise ending
The suprise ending

[Outro: Brandy]
Endin', endin', no
You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
Yeah

[Verse 1: Brandy]
I didn't notice the signs
You covered both of my eyes
(Mix-match text messages, voicemail evidence)
The audience yellin', "damn, she's blind"
Now it's all so clear
And I was also not scared
(Now I know she missed stunt double skipped on it)
Audience kept yellin', "Not the space

[Pre-Hook: Brandy]
I could say that I knew the whole time, but I would be lyin'
You'd have to be a hidden camera, recordin' each take of cryin'
I would say that I would just go to your part, to stop the taping
But the end's here, and I can't change it

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
The suspense is buildin'
Sittin' on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickenin'
I was hangin' off the cliff, love
You said it's a surprise, what's the surprise ending?

[Verse 2: Brandy]
You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
(Guess you kept missin' it, homeboys visitin')
The audience yellin', "yeah, that's right"
And now it's not so clear
You don't know how you missed me
Don't buy you were gone
Stopped goin' through your phone
The audience yellin', "'bout damn time"
[Pre-Hook: Brandy]
I could say that I knew the whole time, but I would be lyin'
You'd have to be a hidden camera, recordin' each take of cryin'
I would say that I would just go to your part, to stop the taping

Yeah

[Verse 1]
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

[Verse 2]
The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life
[Pre-Chorus 2]
A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born (Yeah)
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach?
The sweet life

[Bridge]
And the water is exactly what I wanted (Ah)
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy, ahh

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

[Verse 1]
That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see 'em
And I've got this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off these shoes and swim good, swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, swim good
Good...

[Verse 2]
Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD
Memory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference?
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze
Ever since I lost my baby
I've had this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile 'til the road runs out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off these shoes and swim good, swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, swim good

Ahh, don't try stopping me
I'm going off
Ahh, don't try saving
No flares, no vest
No fear, waves washing me out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'm about to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off these shoes and swim good, swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, swim good

That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?

And every time the cops pull me over they don't ever see 'em
They never see them

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've got this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

Damn, you hungry
I mean, its cool, want some more?

I built us a little gingerbread house
You said you loved it, I baked you a little
Gingerbread Benz, and you said you dug it
I make stacks and stacks of cake in the bank, bank
You ate through 'em, you ate through 'em
You ate through 'em, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
When I re-up, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you
Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweety, you tell me now that your craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby

[Verse 2]
We took chartered flights
All around to taste those malls that
You like most, said the jefe food taste like pink raspberry
Good credit, A1, just like that sauce
Said you liked Ruth's Chris way better
Lean back my seat, watch your head go down
[Chorus]
Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
When I re-up, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed

But sweety, you tell me now that your craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby

Please give me my trees, give 'em back
Give me tourists, give me traffic
Give me noise, just give it back
Could you bring back all my police, give me order
Turn back on my lights, give me fuel and water
I think I'm begging, cause now that everything's gone
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
With the streets all dark, it looks like my buildings are gone

[Hook]
I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city
Gave you, power over, power over me

The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more
[Verse 2]
Tell the government, please give me funding
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?
Give me floodgates, give me levees
Too much water can you push it back
How you just gon' leave me out of order
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
I know I'm begging, cause now that everything's dried up
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
And with the streets all dark, the buildings look lost

Yeah, it's real simple bitch
You understand me?
Bitch I'm a player now
Your main bitch works for me
Yeah. Yeah
I haven't worn a shirt since 1993
That's the year I moved my operation to the beach
Half a dozen cameras on me when I'm in the streets
Pop, pop!
Hit out on me
Building mansions on the sand
Your girl looks like Kelis
She must hate you so much right now
She must hate you so much right now
Run my fingers through her hair
My girl looks like Kelis
Man she must love me so...

Sid: This is my once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Felt the morning sun and knew that
This was my once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Even got a kiss from you
I feel like hoppin' up and down
Like a kangaroo
Jumpin' fences, climbin' trees
What pleases me is what I'll do, 'cause

[Chorus]
This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Everyone's entitled to be wild
Be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year
This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Once a year we're jumping fences
This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Once a year we lose our senses

[Verse 2]
Look at Charlie up a tree
Kissin' Katie's ear
Charlie's wife is mad as hell

[Chorus]
Oh well it happens once a year
And this is that once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Everyone's entitle to be wild
Be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year

[Verse 3]
Look at Papa Halterbush
92 today
Running off with Sadie Lee

He's heading for that pile of hay
'Cause this is his once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Everyone's entitle to be wild
Be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when the tears have run out
We'll be numb and blue, blue

[Refrain: Mr. Hudson & Frank Ocean]
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I still dream, dream, dream
I still dream, dream (There will be)

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
My grandaddy was a player
Pretty boy in a pair of gators
See, I met him later on
Think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know
But pretty soon, he'd be gone too
Hide my face, hide my face
Can't let 'em see me crying
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying
My friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had
Well, I can
I'm sad and
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
There will be tears, I have no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
"I can't be there"
That's all you had to say to me was you couldn't be there
Why couldn't you say to me you won't be there?
You coulda warned me you wouldn't be here
Right here, you wouldn't be here for me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
          
            
[Verse 1]
You say you got a girl
Yeah, how you want me?
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless, of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, always in your lap
Like is you comin' home? Are you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend
[Verse 2]
I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal, just two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them
More of you on me, on us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you what you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for, 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday (Don't worry 'bout none)
Then just send him my way (Don't worry 'bout none)
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Outro]
Think I got it covered
Think I-

"'A storm is coming,' Frank says. 'A storm that will swallow the children. And I will deliver them from the kingdom of pain. I'll deliver the children back to their doorsteps. I'll send the monsters back to the underground. I'll send them back to a place where no one else can see them except for me'..."

[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when...

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho, since you think
I don't love you I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though I'm lying down
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?

'Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh

Yes of course I remember, how could I forget how you feel?
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white, ooh

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?

[Verse 1: Einstein]
To be honest, I don't really know how to start this
I never been big for showing emotions, but I'm broken hearted
Wow, that's crazy, it's hard to accept the fact
That after, everything we been through, its still too hard to forget the past
But, that's life, that's how the story unfolds
We doing our thang, two different ways, living life and growing old
We always said we were meant to be, and other people begged to differ
But none of that mattered to me, as long as you were still in the picture
So I, decided to frame it, but recently I been getting famous
I'm hitting the road, doing different shows, while you stuck at home, just waiting
Well, that ain't fair to you, but it ain't fair to me, what you decided to do
Going behind my back, but I ain't gonna go and put you blast, so I'mma leave it at that, cause I'm still too nice of a dude
That's cool, do you, I'mma do me
20 months, of love and trust, ha, could of fooled me
Jokes on me, we wasted time together
But you spend a lot of time getting wasted, so I guess wasted time was pleasure
Ha, it's whatever, might as well leave it at that
You changed so much there ain't no way we'll ever be able to turn back
But, it's hard to even think about being without you
Oh! Remember you wanted your song, here, I wrote this when I was thinking about you

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Look up look up look up
You see the last line in the air
Reach out reach out
And try to catch one if you can
Right now they're flying
Circling in coasts in the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Feels like I'm on the 30th floor staring out my window
And seeing them right about to crash right into you
You marching on the sidewalk umbrella up
Oblivious no clouds shades on no sun
Right now they're flying
Circling in coasts in the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down

You better look up

Verse:
I've been thinking
Bout the thing that we call the future
Can it come, any sooner
Stuck in my heart is the voice of a dreamer
Young hiroshima
Blow up the mind of the doubters
Spiritual doctor
He can heal your hate
We can never make a connection if we don't relate
By my faith, Got me
Feeling optimistic for the things that I see
See through Jesus so we can walk on Seas
I'm way above average, so what I see is not what you see
Its not C
I pray for the grace to be amazing
Sing along to my songs like hymns
Praises be to him
But my future is all I think about

I'm always thinking so far, ahead
I've been thinking bout forever
Thinking bout forever
I'm always thinking ahead (3x)
You know
Ive been thinking bout forever
You know

[Intro]
Get on my bike and I'mma fly through time
Until I'm with you
I promise

[Verse 1]
I'm scared
I guess I shouldn't be
But I'm a boy
In this adult body
I know I said
That we would grow old together
But I haven't
And thats cost you years

[Pre-Hook]
This is has been the one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears

[Hook]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go
[Verse 2]
I tried
With all my might, I peddled as fast as I could
Until the years just started to flicker past
Our life, oh all of it
I saw memories on both sides of the road
I pointed them out as I went along
Right there, we're making out listening to Purple Rain in the basement
And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it

[Pre-Hook]
This is has been the one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears

[Hook]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself

[Bridge]
I'm on my way there
To that time in space
I wish you could see, all that I see now
I'm headed towards you, yeah
I wish that time could wait
I'm on my way home
[Pre-Hook]
This is has been the one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears

[Hook]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go
Lift off and go

[Intro]
Why do birds
Suddenly appear? (Mmm, yeah-yeah)
Everytime that you're near (Ooh-wee, baby)
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you

[Verse]
I'll be honest
You had me devastated
Shit you coulda
Held my hand through this baby
Just like mine
Versions of these
Belong to you
(Yeah-yeah, aye, aye)
After a while
They're keeping me
Close to you

[Bridge]
And that is why

[Verse 2]
Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, I
Never can say goodbye
Even though the pain and heartache seems to
Follow me wherever I go
Try to hide the feelings but they
Always seem to show
When you say you're leaving me
I can't help but say no
Tell me why, is it so?
I don't wanna let you go
Never can say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Oh, we’re in this together
Have a little faith
Oh, you ought to know who you are
Oh, we’re all children
We’re all human, we’re all breathing
We’re all needing, more than what they're giving
Can’t you feel it?
The space of what’s missing

[Pre-Chorus]
You look up and they tell you it’s a godless sky, a godless sky
So you look down
Cause you’ve convinced yourself
That this is all you’ve got, all you’ve got

[Chorus]
But picture four billion hearts beating with yours, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together, we’re together

[Verse 2]
I love you
And I don’t know you
But I know the light in you
Is the same as in me
I trust you, like a brother
Cause who could understand the pain
Better than someone who’s going through it
[Pre-Chorus]
You look up and they tell you it’s a godless sky, a godless sky
But don’t you look down
Don’t you convince yourself
That this is all you’ve got, all you’ve got

[Chorus]
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together

[Bridge]
I’ve searched the souls of my people
For something to believe in
Oh, not words that I could say
But I heard them, I heard them

[Chorus]
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together

[Verse: Lupe Fiasco & Frank Ocean Sample]
Elegant dust falls like water off tall cliffs
What starts as icebergs and small drips
Gangs up in what you can call crips
(Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?)
Blue seas, slipping like skis over the top like T's
Camouflage colored, chamomile on the battlefield
I relax and chill, yeah
Dapper Dan daffodils
Two G's worth of recording gear to make reports for your ears
I'm a little teapot, short and stout
But I'm a little ski shop, sports and routes
(Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?)
[?] double black diamond
Took that shop to a resort now I'm shining
Don't get a bullet lodged
I'm just here to lift 'em up, I didn't duck
Figure the flow icy so get a puck
[?] homie is sick as fuck
Look at it closely, but do it anti-socially
It's a winter wonderland but it's toasty
Two slots i work with both days
Two shots dapper pants
Niagara used to fall on my pair
Step outside, hear the voice of Creasy Bear
All up in the air like "Yeah"
Shit's the bomb, come talk to the derriere
Take every care, go blind stare in that glare
The air, Kool-Aid and Pierrier
Three cheers til they get him to cheer
I be blessed, sports and routes
I play with paths like Professor X
My on IG, that means you can snort the house
Tokyo freeze, look all this powder about, ha

[Verse 1]
You didn't come out tonight so a man could talk to you
Just wore that dress cause you knew that we'd all be watching you
You got enough cash to buy your favorite drink too
Out with the girls for the night and us guys, you give 'em the blues

[Hook]
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothin' for me
You can't do nothin' for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fuckin night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down

[Verse 2]
You see if I was another type I'da ran away from you
Off to the nearest one who woulda rolled because of who I am
So tell me your name or somethin', she said "Is it game or somethin'?"
"You pullin' the famous card, it's cute and all but not enough"

[Hook]
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothin' for me
You can't do nothin' for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fuckin night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
I see the end of the night

[Outro]
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down, oh

Go, go, go

[Verse 1]
Forbidden from the beginning
I saw her there (up there)
Been like that since I met her
They said I couldn't have her
Way out of my league
I never believed it
I gotta get her heart
I gotta make her mine

[Verse 2]
But what if she just tells me
I'm not quite her speed or
Shows me her bares hands
And crushes my ego
Dismiss me as a kid
Tell me I'm barely legal
But bareley legal

[Chorus]
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
I slept with someone I little younger, younger
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Who loves ya

Girl if I gotta show ID (show ID)
I'm gonna (gonna)
Won't let you get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Younger, no

[Verse 3]
This conversation is taking us for a loop
Taking you serious is difficult to do
Cause I don't believe ya
When you say that you don't
Ever look at me quite that way
You say that you trying to settle down
But you I'm handsome
I should be having fun
I shouldn't move fast

So I went faster
Cause it ain't no fun
Without ya

[Chorus]
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
I slept with someone I little younger, younger
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Who loves ya

Girl if I gotta show ID (show ID)
I'm gonna (gonna)
Won't let you get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Younger, no

[Verse 1]
Taking turns with pressing ignore
Only to come to the conclusion
That there’s no one we both love more
Back and forth, emotional tug of war
Girl I love you
But I just can’t do this revolving door any longer

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain’t making sense no more

[Chorus]
Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Maybe it’s the "me" in you that I dislike the most
Ironically, in the beginning that’s what made us close
And now that’s the very reason
That we’re slamming doors
But we’re both adults, it’s time we get over it

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain’t making sense no more

[Chorus]
So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah
[Bridge]
If we stop this fighting
We can dance all night in this bitch
Be no fighting if you keep on rocking that shit
Won’t be no fighting, I’ma throw the towel in
Cause I decided, I like us way better like this

[Chorus]
So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I guess it felt a little bit better when we were still arguing about it
Cause in the words I could still hear love
Somebody still cared
And I would rather sleep on the sofa as long as you're still in our bed
At least I'm sure that you're at home and you ever left me yeah

[Hook]
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't

[Chorus]
Try to leave me
Try to stay
Giving up
Is harder baby
Don't try don't try
Don't try to leave girl
Try to stay
Try, try

[Verse 2]
It's breaking my heart to see you there
Sickening I hate standing at that station
It's a picture that I don't wanna frame
Tears in your eyes
Luggage at your side

[Hook x2]
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta work too hard
Tryna break my heart
But don't try, don't try, don't try
You ain't gotta work too hard
Trying to move on ohh oh
Try to stay
Try to think

[Chorus]
Don't try to leave me
Try to stay
Giving up
Is harder baby
Don't try don't try
Don't try to leave girl
Try to stay
Try
Try, try
Just try

VERSE 1:
Never expected it would take so much pretending
I ain't over you and that’s a fact
I even threw away all the gifts you got me but in the present I'm still wrapped up in the past

HOOK:
Anything that I ever do boy, everything reminds me of you boy, everywhere I go I see you boy, just can't seem to shake you off...whenever I hear our song boy, whenever I smell your Cologne boy, it takes me back to our love and I can’t escape you

CHORUS:
I been tryin so hard to get over you boy
It's hard to keep going on when you're still holding on
I been tryin so hard to get over you boy
It's obvious and it shows and I just can't let it go
I stay in my hive, time won't wash away
And though we're apart somehow you managed to stay
I been tryin so hard to get over you boy

VERSE 2:
Driving down a boulevard and everytime I see a blue BMW my heart jumps cause I think it's you
And when I’m grocery shipping I go down that aisle
And I see those chocolate coa-coa pebbles that you like

REPEAT HOOK AND CHORUS

VERSE 3:
Our chapter is done but I can’t seem to turn away
Made up my mind
Tried and tried boy but its taking way too long
Trying to stay out of dodge

You think you can beat me at my own game ( ooh, ooh )
I just wanna say you're lame ( oh burn )
You think you can sneak around my back
The only thing you lack
Is a brain
Ohhh did i be too harsh
But baby it is so true
Maybe i hurt you
A bit too much but do I really care.......no way

Chorus
Try me yeah try me but you will fail
This is my game, my rules do you not understand
I guess you are what i said u r
So don't come on back to me
Cause you aren't my guy
I hate you
Do you get it now
So don't try me

I don't love you
I despise you
I am single yes but i ain't looking for anyone
So leave me alone
Pooooo
You are

I read in the paper that my brothers are being thrown from rooftops blindfolded with their hands tied behind their backs for violating sharia law. I heard the crowds stone these fallen men if they move after they hit the ground. I heard it’s in the name of God. I heard my pastor speak for God too, quoting scripture from his book. Words like abomination popped off my skin like hot grease as he went on to describe a lake of fire that God wanted me in. I heard on the news that the aftermath of a hate crime left piles of bodies on a dance floor this month. I heard the gunman feigned dead among all the people he killed. I heard the news say he was one of us. I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a faggot as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist. Many are annoyed by our wanting to be married like everyone else or use the correct restroom like everyone else. Many don’t see anything wrong with passing down the same old values that send thousands of kids into suicidal depression each year. So we say pride and we express love for who and what we are. Because who else will in earnest? I daydream on the idea that maybe all this barbarism and all these transgressions against ourselves is an equal and opposite reaction to something better happening in this world, some great swelling wave of openness and wakefulness out here. Reality by comparison looks grey, as in neither black nor white but also bleak. We are all God’s children, I heard. I left my siblings out of it and spoke with my maker directly and I think he sounds a lot like myself. If I being myself were more awesome at being detached from my own story in a way I being myself never could be. I wanna know what others hear, I’m scared to know but I wanna know what everyone hears when they talk to God. Do the insane hear the voice distorted? Do the indoctrinated hear another voice entirely?

Two years ago I found an image of a kid with her hands covering her face. A seatbelt reached across her torso, riding up her neck and a mop of blonde hair stayed swept, for the moment, behind her ears. Her eyes seemed clear and calm but not blank, the road behind her seemed the same. I put myself in her seat then I played it all out in my head. The claustrophobia hits as the seatbelt tightens, preventing me from even leaning forward in my seat. the pressing on internal organs. I lean back and forward to release it. Then backwards and forward again. There it is—I got free. How much of my life has happened inside of a car? I wonder if the odds are that I'll die in one. Knock on wood-grain. Shouldn’t speak like that. We live in cars in some cities, commuting across space either for our livelihood, or devouring fossil fuels for joy. It's close to as much time as we spend in our beds, more for some. The first time I did shrooms, my manager had to come rescue me from Caltech’s ‘Trip Day.’ As I got into her car, I swear to God the aluminum center console in her Porsche truck looked like it was breathing, like the throat of something. On the freeway, leaving Pasadena, we spoke and I looked away, outside, at the wheels and tires of cars doing that optical illusion thing they do where it looks like they’re spinning backwards, which, according to Google, happens because our brains are assuming something completely wrong and showing it to us. Staring, I was transfixed by all the indicator lights oscillating and throbbing against the wind. We drove thru downtown LA headed west, flying on the same freeways I used to run outta gas on. Welcomed in by the perennial creatures, imperial palm trees and climbing vines living their lives out just off the shoulder. The feeling familiar enhanced, on the 10. I used to ride around in my sinewy crossover SUV, smoke and listen to rough mixes of my old shit before it came out, or whatever someone wanted to play when they hooked up their iPhone to the aux cord. A few years and few daily-drivers later I'm not driving much anymore. It's been a year since I moved to London, at the time of writing this, and there's no practical reason to drive in this city. I ordered a GT3 RS and it'll keep low miles out here but I guess it's good to have in case of emergency :) Raf Simons once told me it was cliché, my whole car obsession. Maybe it links to a deep subconscious straight boy fantasy. Consciously though, I don't want straight—a little bent is good. I found it romantic, sometimes, editing this project. The whole time I felt as though I was in the presence of a $16m McLaren F1 armed with a disposable camera. My memories are in these pages, places closeby and long ass-numbing flights away. Cruising the suburbs of Tokyo in RWB Porsches. Throwing parties around England and mobbing freeways in four project M3S that I built with some friends. Going to Mississippi and playing in the mud with amphibious quads. Street-casting models at a random kung fu dojo out in Senegal. Commissioning life-size toy boxes for the fuck of it. Shooting a music video for fun with Tyrone Lebon, the genius giant. Taking a break/reconnaissance mission to Tulum, Mexico, enjoying some star visibility for a change. Recording in Tokyo, NYC, Miami, LA, London, Paris. Stopping in Berlin to witness Berghain for myself. Trading jewels and soaking in parables with the many-headed Brandon aka BasedGod in conversation. I wrote a story in the middle—It’s called “Godspeed.” It's basically a reimagined part of my boyhood. Boys do cry, but I don't think I shed a tear for a good chunk of my teenage years. It's surprisingly my favorite part of life so far. Surprising, to me, because the current phase is what I was asking the cosmos for when I was a kid. Maybe that part had its rough stretches too, but in my rearview mirror it's getting small enough to convince myself it was all good. And really though... It's still all goodSELF-SERVING, ARROGANT, PRETENTIOUS, CONTROLLING, STUBBORN, INCONSISTENT, MORALLY GREY… GORGEOUS, MODEST, COMPASSIONATE, GENIUS, HONEST, KIND, RELIABLE, RARE HUMAN BEING.

i’ll take the positive and not so positive adjectives about me in stride.

I’ve been meaning to write you more. different hotels every night aren’t so bad really. in fact- all the moving house could inspire a photo series.. not for the gram, knowing me it’s probably only for whoever controls my estate in the future and enthusiastically develops all the rolls of film i forgot to. i’m in belgium, just 7 concerts into a tour with an ambiguous ending. i’d tour for a year if it didn’t interrupt my recording or my weekend driving. i really wanted to go to cairo in between europe and australia.. might let things settle some.. go to south africa instead and place some flowers on a gate for the president.for being epic and 94. i write on paper at night. my tour manager gave me a small powder blue book at the beginning of this run with gold embossed lettering on the cover that reads ‘one line a day’.. it’s easier than you’d think to narrow the entire cinema of your day into one sentence. i never read them back in the morning. whenever morning is.. even my macbook clock can’t keep up. all the travel isn’t in support of an album or anything like that really- past or ahead. there’s no label or touring firm dollars involved. all pennies from my pocket. in support of some odd daydream. ops to photograph crowds and clouds from planes. contrast all the quiet with some noise. new noise and old noise..sober crowd, faaded crowd. all welcome.

i can’t save the world. my sun will die eventually. one convenient part of being creative and well-resourced in life though, is that you can make a point to never be bored. oh and you can seclude yourself from the voices of fools. if you love me… when i’m done, let me vibrate in peace.desensitized eyes on this body i am…in this mirror i am. i got ostracized and didn’t notice till i closed my eyes last a.m. didn’t see. i need a point to keep these eyes in focus. i need my eyes to be quicker than your hands. they aren’t and won’t ever be- so when you do magic i won’t watch. see, my eyes have an ego. i need these eyes like..i need the holes in my head. i always find something off, like a hairline. symmetry gives me boner, it isn’t boring at all. my eyes don’t bore me at all. neither do yours. i never saw you fuck, except that one time? i still get off to the residue that the image left behind. what i see inside my mind now isn’t technically with my eyes. i heard about a third, but i’ll believe it when i see it blink on my forehead. big head. five head. eye don’t know. eyes just talking.

LA is a bubble, one large iridescent bubble.. soap and ocean water. floating. at least it lets the planes out. & only the ears pop, never the bubble. after you leave a while you’ll miss it. although, you can really miss the worst things.. a cigarette, a doomed bus. easy tiger, i hold a deep affection for los angeles and it’s oppressive sunshine. moms is moving here this summer, my kid brother’s going to middle school. middle school. fuck, i’m getting old.. in los angeles.

NO MATTER HOW DIM IT GETS WHEREVER I AM

I never quit working. I work in the dark cause work is light. I tell my work all my problems because it never gives answers i have already. It never edits without me. Doesn’t call me names. I give my work away, because it doesn’t cost me much. In fact i’m indebted. I work hard since life is hard. Death is a soft place, it can wait. But work ain’t love. And love ain’t work. For sure.I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH LIKING THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE. SOLIDARITY CAN BE COOL. I’M NOT JUDGING YOU. YOU’RE STILL AN INDIVIDUAL. I’LL EVEN CALL YOU ‘INDIE’ IF THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER

On the real though Donald Trump. How is it 'interesting' that these shootings happened in a country that's tough on guns? Tell us Don? Because it sounds like that vacuous observation was about giving your NRA-loving constituency a handjob and spinning a tragedy for political gain and I'm thinking maybe using a situation where dozens of innocents have just been murdered in the streets isn't the best time. No?

Love to Paris and any individual or family who's lost loved ones to evil anywhere in this world. Chill w/ the angels.



I'm not even gonna say rest in peace because it’s bigger than death. I never met the man (I was too nervous the one time I saw him) and I never saw him play live, regrettably, I only know the legends I’ve heard from folks and what I’ve heard and seen from his deep catalog of propellant, fearless, virtuosic work.

My assessment is that he learned early on how little value to assign to someone else’s opinion of you.. an infectious sentiment that seemed soaked into his clothes, his hair, his walk, his guitar and his primal scream. He wrote my favorite song of all time, "when you were mine". It’s a simple song with a simple melody that makes you wish you thought of it first, even though you never would have - a flirtatious brand of genius that feels approachable.

He was a straight black man who played his first televised set in bikini bottoms and knee high heeled boots, epic. He made me feel more comfortable with how I identify sexually simply by his display of freedom from and irreverence for obviously archaic ideas like gender conformity etc. He moved me to be more daring and intuitive with my own work by his demonstration - his denial of the prevailing model...his fight for his intellectual property - ‘slave’ written across the forehead, name changed to a symbol... an all out rebellion against exploitation.

A vanguard and genius by every metric I know of who affected many in a way that will outrun oblivion for a long while. I’m proud to be a Prince fan(stan) for life.

[Verse 1]
Sad he never takes her no where
And she always in these rooms
She was more than just a phone call
She says she's really in the mood

Don't you move cause I'm coming

[Verse 1]
My head fatiguing off the opus
Kept it underground to focus
I feel afterlife, six under oath, don't want no hocus pocus
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact, rip my facemask
Nothin' but, nothin' but net, is you Roger or Novak?
You still are no match, you get no rematch
Boy, you missed your moment
Persuing the MoMA, I'm all on my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold 'cause he's sculpture
Where's the shaman, Ayahuasca
I had WhatsApp'd him for atonement
I never ever trust the pre-rolled
I never let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him 'cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though
It forever seemed like time's up
When we swerved in the Honda
Now forever seems like no time
I mean, time flies when you have some
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons
My crew saved your crew
Like niggas came through with the Groupons
Cookin' with the grease now, truffle fries and Cholula
Are you slowin' down? Are you holdin' down?
Whoever held you down
Whoever propped you up, built the structures with you
Swished the buckets with ya, who was fuckin' with ya?
Really brothers when you needed that?
When you see 'em now is it forced black?
Hail Mary on fourth down
Hands to the sky, yeah

[Verse 2]
Peace to the holy, peace to the people that think they know me
Piece of Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing
Peace to the boys that we used to be though
Geto Boy North Face too cold on these hoes
Peace out to Willie D, Bushwick Billy and Face
Piece of steak grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace
Hands to the sky

[Verse 3]
U-N-I-T-Y, Neptunes and peace signs
Chiraq, Palestine like
Iberville 1995
You'd think that was airstrikes on outside
I put refugees in my villa, play kids the Fu-Gee-La
All this space Atlanta
Place order McMansion and two apple pies
I want the Porsche Bugatti-designed
Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up
How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine?
Sick, blue nose pit foamin' white like frappo jacko
El Chapo, de facto
Bell nacho, shell taco, crunch crackle
Green emerald, pink diamonds like Apple Jack bowl


Versace Versace I'll play the piano I'm not Liberace

[Verse]
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
(Voodoo)
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
(Voodoo)
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
(Voodoo)

[Hook]
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands, in his hands

[Intro]
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a dream

[Verse 1]
From my Lou's I'm seeing colors
Turquoise, ocean green, hurricane silver, yeah
I'm falling, down a well
Wish you were the water there
Just like a sun without a flame
Fell asleep without a dream
I saw the light fade
I let it drift away
I'm in that air and it's hard to breathe
Gravity won't hold my feet
(How'd I let my love breathe?)

[Pre-Hook]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

[Hook]
Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Verse 2]
I'm in Emerald City, looking for Wizard Oz
Maybe he could tell me the way
To your heart again
I click my J's three times wishing she would've stayed
And then I thought I put her on a plane
Found a diamond for your ring
The crows on Saturn, then I'm back in L.A
I woke up, she ain't there
Levitating off the mattress
Baby where you at?
I said, oh, baby where you at?

[Pre-Hook]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

[Hook]
Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Outro]
It’s just a dream, that’s all our love is
It's just a dream
(It's just a dream)
(My love is in that bottle)
(Save, save me)

[Intro / Verse 1]
We missed the light show
(That's what I call the weather)
Missed it like a three, a three
You and me and
I'm so sorry
I meant to lift the blinds some
So the sun could show off on us
It kind of slips my mind
Whenever we're in bed

[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

Shades on, lights off
But you on
And I'm on you
Oh yea
[Verse 2]
See my reflection on your chanel
(vintage)
I just got those for you
(tight)
I put em on you
(haha)
If you want baby
I'd go and lift the blinds some
So the sun could have a look at ya
But I see you just fine
Whenever we're in bed

[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

[Bridge]
Now just right
Round my head too
Keep em on
When we going
Going strong
Got the red ones
With the polarized tint on em
Oh
[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

Shades on, lights off
But you on
And I'm on you
Oh yea

[Verse 1]
I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose, but baby, don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman, but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something

[Chorus]
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try
You and I try, try
We all try

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I still believe in man (Oh, oh)
A wise one asked me why (Oh, oh)
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked (Wicked)
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try (Try, try)
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try (Every girl tries)
You and I try (Every boy tries), try
We all try

[Outro]
Try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe, try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe, try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe
Oh, I, I do believe, I do believe

[Verse 1]
I don’t believe in love, cause I don’t feel no pain
Been with so many dudes, it just don’t feel the same
I don’t believe in you, your albums sells ain't true
I believe strippers should get health insurance too
I don’t believe that you gone leave her for me
At that award show tweeting out yall selfie
I don’t believe that you call yourself suing me
I’ve been through enough, why can’t you let me be
I don’t believe that God took my aunt from me
And I’m just crying because I don’t believe in

[Hook]
Nothing, nothing
Pray to God that he’ll show me
Something, something
Cause I feel nothing

[Verse 2]
I don’t believe I’m single to this day
I don’t believe in much, but I still pray
I don’t believe the Grammy’s didn’t nominate me
I’m a lil' ratchet, but my music’s everything
I don’t believe my best friend stole from me
I don’t believe my sister cares for me
Make me a mother, and I’ll make me a wife
Never made me smile, but always made me cry
It don’t work out, but I gotta try
And I’m just crying, cause I don’t believe in
[Hook]
Nothing, nothing
Pray to God that he’ll show me
Something, something
Cause I feel nothing[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt (Skrrt!)
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler the Creator]
I ride to California (Yeah)
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me (ayy, yeah)
Slick circles float roll
Out this world
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Tyler, The  Creator]
Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton
Water your garden, my nigga (Stunt on these niggas!)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too (What the fuck?)
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man
It feels like I'm winning (I'm winnin', nigga)
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me
Slick circles roll float
Out this world
Yeah, yeah
Run it, run it, run it, yeah
(Ohh, ohh!)
[Bridge: Tyler, The  Creator]
I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I—
(Let's go!)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a lil' while, nigga makin' leaves
Keep it in my branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is skrong
Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez
Droppin' them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Ah, shit!

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh
Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it[Verse 1]
I'm out in front of Supreme, like I own it
Buttercream Benz, goldfinger wheels
Driver can't steer, but look like Pam Grier
She like "Where's there parking around here"
That spots reserved, so are those right there
Reserved for who?
For pretty girls in sports cars

[Bridge]
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Cause my license been suspended
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Got my feet up on the wood grain, roof missing

[Hook]
You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be a gun but you're a girl
Only if whipping could kill

[Verse 2]
Up and down Mulholland, on the weekends we chill
You're driving with no shoes - cruise control
Love the way you take the wheel
Got your photo on my air freshener
In a sense just like the

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 3]
I just finished practice
She's on her way to get me, she's in traffic
She said give her 20 minutes (I'm finna hop in the shower)
Girl I hope 20 don't mean an hour
And as the cold water runs over my chest
I've been thinking 'bout your skirt on my head rest

Pretty girl driving my sports car
Pretty, roof missing

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4]
I let you drive my Benz
Flossing all your friends around town
I let you fill my seats with shopping bags
I let you go do your thing riding with your friends round town
Riding with your girlfriends
And I always keep it clean
So why don't you park in the front just to stunt
That'll make all them bitches mad
Why don't you lift up the roof just to stunt
It'll make all them bitches mad
All them girls wanna be you
[Hook]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything is going to be alright?
One look out my window, there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and it was silent
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I'll forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love like you forget a daydream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
We'll all fade to grey soon, on the TV station

[Verse 1]
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
(Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed, we're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times

[Verse 2]
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

[Verse 3]
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life (life), in this life (life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
(Thought you might want to know now)
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life

[Verse 4]
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You’re tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam



They treat you rough out there
But we've got Alcantara everywhere
Ferrari

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mine on the road
Your dilated eyes
Watch the clouds float
White Ferrari
Had a good time
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're so familiar
White Ferrari
Good times
I care for you still
And I will
Forever
That was my part of the deal
Honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari
Good times

(In this life)
You love me still and you will forever
You got that part of the deal
We got so familiar
Running my hands thru your hair
White Ferrari
Had a good time
(in this life)

One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids
On a facelift
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it it'll be over in no time
And that's life

I'll drop you off and in a few months
We'll talk again
When you need a break
Which part of the circle will you stand on
You keep doing the dance wrong

I'm sure we're taller in other dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of moving
Your body's aching
We should vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull
Least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam

Like a mirage
Always one step ahead
Where we belong
I've got a son somewhere
He'll be picking up where I left off
I might name that boy Ferrari
He'll meet a girl named Altashonda
He'll treat her soft like Alcantara
My brain is soft like Alcantara
My hands are rough, I'm iguana
Your hair is long, are you Nicaraguan?
I can't go soft, I'm Viagran
You want it all
You're always one step ahead
Where you belong

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]

Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything, is going to be alright?
When I look out my window there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and there was silence
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I forget

[Verse 2: Melo-X]

I forget 23, shit what year was that?
Nowadays life can fly by so fast like cars you see on highways
Watch 'em driving past, they all got a destination
Many elders say that you should focus more on the steps that's takin
To get there, but damn it's taking too long, been waiting so long
Now I feel like I'm breaking my strong
Ways of thinking about the reality of this industry
And exactly what it takes for me
To get to where I want to be
If trees could speak
They would talk about these brand new humans that came around
Building things that brought smog around
Now, how's that for gentrification?
While I'm patiently waiting the arrival
Of real shit that goes viral
I speak to those with they eyes closed
Tell 'em open 'em up
Sit, back, relax and tote on a blunt
Frontin' like I been sober for months
Last night I was in the club laying drunk
Screamin' out what the, huh
Yeah you know the word
And at the end of the day I'm just tryin' to be heard
Ya heard
[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]

But I forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a daydream
And what if all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
Will all fade to grey soon, on the TV station[Verse]
Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry

Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter

[Outro]
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire

[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler, we, ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme, I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the skyline
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind, I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow!
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? Where we at? Where we at? Where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Bimmer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says "Fuck 'em!" on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter, that's where I'm at
Now, where we at? Where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at? (Wolf Gang)
[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah, I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah, she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? Where we at? Where we–
We on top of the world, on top of the world
Nigga, top of the world

[Verse 4: Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane?
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at, nigga? Where we at, nigga?
Uh, we on top of the world, on top of the world
[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Where we at, where we at, niggas? Where we at?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

[Verse 5: Tyler, The Creator]
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth, Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying "Fuck everybody", I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home, but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do, Clancy and David are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully, I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully, I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining, making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
"Can we get backstage, man?" — No, faggot, it's sold out!
"Come on, why you holding out? I thought we was boys
Without me, you wouldn't be Tyler, The Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots!"
But I'm a fucking unicorn! — Whatever, man
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full Monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
"Here’s some 'Give a Fuck' cake" — Oh, maybe I should have some
"Asshole, have none!"
How can I wake up on the wrong side of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
("Shit, I don't know")
When I'm on that stage, I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me...
In school, I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah, I'm rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building!
[Outro: Tyler The Creator, Hodgy, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
[Gunshots]
Fuck, take this!
Nigga, what the f— (Hodgy)
Nigga, what the fuck are you doin'? You just gon—
Nig— hold on, hold on, nigga, can— (I'm sorry)
Ay, nigga, all the shit that we been through, can we just fuckin' talk about this? (I'm sorry)
Nigga, you just gon' shoot me in my moth—
[Gunshot]
I'm sorry, fuck... the fuck did I just do? Fuck! Ah shit!
Tyler... (Fuck, man) Tyler, give me the gun
(Ah fuck) Give me the gun. (The fuck, man? The fuck?)
It's gonna be alright (Ah fuck man, I'm fucked, I'm so fucked! Ah shit!)
It's fine, Tyler, believe me
I don't know why the f— I don't know what the fuck I was thinking, man, I don't f—
It's gonna be okay (Ohh fuck dude M— Ahh)
I gotta hide the fuckin— I can't hide the fuckin' bodies
I'm here to help. I'm your friend
(Now w—) You were supposed to fuckin' help me!
I'm here to help you, Tyler. (The fuck!)
Calm down, I'm here to help you. (Fuck! Agh!)
I'm your friend. *Crying*

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Over where the trees burn down
The place where the fields went down in flames
We could put a hole in the ground
Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
And tonight I'll hold you close, close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we dance this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring when flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (when I was young)
See me (too) wither
(when I was young)

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Know that (me) I've enjoyed the sunshine
When I was young, know it happens all— (me)
Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine— (me)
Know it happens all (me) —all the time (me)
Know it happens all (me) —all the time (me)
When I was young (me, me)

[Intro: Stacy]

Hey, uh, call me back
I don’t mean...how I came after the other night
I just I had a lot to drink in
I wasn't thinking, I miss you, call me back!

[Verse 1: Stacy]

I've never known a love so strong
You’ve got my heart hemmed up in the palm of your hand
And therefore I surrender, never had to wonder boy
I’m wherever you are
You are , you are
And I can't sleep without you, tossing and turning
Turning and tossing, exhausted
Wondering where you could be
If not with me!

[Hook:]

You are as necessary as the air I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You’re like a vital organ I can’t live without you, without you, without you,I need you!
I need you!
Hmmmmmm

[Verse 2: Stacy]

I was born alone, but I don’t wanna die alone
It be a lonely life to live
If it was just me and all of this, no one to share it with
I'd give anything for a family and an apple tree
Upon the car seat up in the rear
Baby on board, baby on board
As I look forward..
See all of these things coming into tuition
But you're young, so young

[Hook:]

You are as necessary as the air I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You’re like a vital organ I can’t live without you, without you, without you, I need you!
I need you!

You are as necessary as the air I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You’re like a vital organ I can’t live without you, without you, without you, I need you!
I need you!

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]

Damn, I can’t believe it!
No, no, no can’t no, can’t believe it!
Baby I loved ya I did, ooh, I did ooh, I did
Keep a pair of your panties under my pillowcase
Ew, but baby that's real
What you didn't want me to lie?
What's gone, long gone
No, you didn’t like this
You didn’t like ‘till I was gone, long gone
Now I moved on, and you in your fucking DeLorean

[Outro: Both]

You are as necessary as the air the I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You’re like a vital organ I can’t live without you, without you, without you, I need you!

Said I can't live without you
Live without you, live without you live without you
I can’t, no!
I need you in my life!
You’re like a vital organ I can’t live without, without you, without you, I need you!
I need you!



Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
How you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild and I need you now

Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah, I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
I found you, oh Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
And I need you now

You too wild, and I need you now

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessy?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah, I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

I was lost and beat up

You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
Ay, I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said, "Baby, what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?"
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph, around hella thugs?"
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves
(What if Mary) "What if Mary
(Was in the club) Was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?"
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
(And she was) We surrounded by
(Surrounded by) The fuckin' wolves

[Part I]

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
The rings all ringed out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
We found out

[Part II]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye [Laughter]
[Bridge: Syleena Johnson, Kanye West & Rick James]
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all
Man, I promise

[Verse 2: Ant Clemons]
Feel like De Niro on Casino
Louis suit got me lookin' like Pacino
Got the Goose and it's chillin' on the ice
What you expect? Meet a girl, got her blowin' on the dice, ooh
She just told me, "Yandhi, you my hero"
I can tell that girl just wants the free clothes
For her cousins, aunties and her freak hoes
But her cousin's auntie is a freak-ho
[Outro: Ant Clemons & Jeezy]
Change in few can move a country
Inner peace don't cost no money
That's the stuff you learn, another lesson learned
(Ha-ha!)

[Verse]
Xenons with the blue color
If that’s a lease, least it look cool on you
That’s your business and I’m off, when I’m on you
Like holidays, I get off on you

[Verse 1]
She saying bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
I'm like who knew, who knew, who knew
After all these years I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too?
When I met you, you were
Chris Brown, Beyoncé and Kells too, Kells too
When you met me I was
T.I., BG, Juve, Outkast and UGK
But we're both long way from home
Got the windows down, radio on
I wrote a letter to the sky, saying maybe one day you can kiss me, kiss me
My girl found it in the car, saying baby why you tryna diss me? Diss me

[Chorus]
You knew you're my baby, you knew you're my baby, yeah
I'm not just in it for the ride, I'm not just in it for the ride
I'm not just in it for the ride, I'm not just in it for the ride
Cause you knew you're my baby

[Verse 1: MuffinCheese]
I'm ace of spades in the game
These bulls be foolin' to quit to get slain
Blow hella ghost, no blocked, cocaine
I was indicted no longer detained
Olympian movement, I'm flaming, I'm torchin'
'member stealing bags all on the porches, I'm talkin-
Bout' power moves over pineapple run
Ain't bout that college, my name came out my gums
Diagnose pussy like Dr. Doolittle
So thick when I smack that ass; ripple
Leave a body tweakin' on the bed; cripple
Teach her the tongue trick, gave em' a riddle
Mo'fucker talkin' two-piece of McChicken
Gone with tellin' times, never been driven
Try to play me; I don't think with dick
I just finessed -
Him & his bitch
Seen em' again
Said he had the stick
Fuck him and his clique, he ain't doin' shit
I got the recipes; Gordon Ramsay
Flippin' Prada, don't take off her panties
Get your precipitation lookin' fancy
Getchu a new one combining candy
OG said he had the kids he was cappin'
We drive by the crib, we seen em' exactly
Phrasin' the Octagon, I seen the depth
I evolve with the -ism with blood in my system
I'm thankin' God for my wisdom
Pockets colossal I'm Juggernaut
They can't tell if I'm on drugs or not
Judgin' be sweet like some apricots
Only actions I don't say a lot
Only goal is to get paid a lot
Only goal is to get paid a lot
[Verse 2: Diego The Sharqman]
Elevated, got a tunnel vision, no tough decision, I just execute
W-W-Walkin' in on some cool shit
Next moment yo' bitch not next to you
I'm thinkin' you already got the message
