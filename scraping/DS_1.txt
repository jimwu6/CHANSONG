Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, yay!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talking shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talking shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talking shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talking shit and give us more, more, more

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Kiss the shoulder, hop in the Corolla
These bitches talkin' shit like the bottom of porta-potties
Bright ass yellow teeth, you a shit talker, gossip
Legs movin' like a salsa dancer
Drunk, fallin' out ya car like a flaccid dick
Aww man, god damn, what the fuck wrong with ya?
Say it to my face, pussy ass boy
Need a Altoid for your hot breath, life a hot mess
Pop your biceps, cue the roid rage

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I think I got like five more albums inside my mind
This that shit, that do or die, make your grandmama cry
Keep some baggy jeans on me, keep a Billie Jean on me
Got that New Orleans on me, smellin' like a queen to ya
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Cu-cu-cucumber lemonade, I need something fresh today
Barber make the texture fade, actin' out like it's charades
Strawberry sweater fleece, baby, give me something sweet
We don't gotta be discreet, moonwalking between the seats

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
Hit on that beat and then stop (Ahh!)
Hop on that booty like who the hell cutie
Like I don't know cootie
My momma ain't raise no bitch ass
Ain't no kiss ass, ain't no-
Get the fuck out of my face now [Burp]
Get the fuck out of my way now
You are so far off my level
Stop!

[Verse 5: Kevin Abstract and Dom McLennon]
In the barber shop with my niggas, ay
I ain't never soft for my nigga, ay
I ain't never copy no nigga, ay
So quit talkin', bitch nigga, (quit yo talkin', bitch) ay
Ay, I wanna buy a Jeep, ay, that's my energy
Trilogy, that's history, Southside, baby, rest in peace!

[Verse 6: Dom McLennon]
Uh, lordy lordy, testify, yeah
Got explosives in my mind, yeah
Search for feelings I can't find, yeah
I'm a ghost because I grind, yeah
Made a deal with Father Time, yeah
Told me "Find a way to shine," yeah
"I can make you live forever
All you gotta do is dance until you die," yeah
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talking shit and give us more, more
Niggas talk shit, talk a whole lot of shit
Need to stop talking shit and give us more, more

Need to stop talking shit and give us more, more, more

[Outro]
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, yay![Chorus: Merlyn Wood, Matt Champion, and Dom McLennon]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, now, now
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract and Merlyn Wood]
Sometimes I be mad that I ain't sexy
Sometimes I be shy to show my blessings
Poppin' like a carbonated beverage
The cops poppin' niggas Orville Redenbacher (Ian, you sexy!)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Most times I give friends more time than family
You remember when I used to feel like I don't understand me
Now we speakin' the same language
I don't listen like I can be
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Sometimes I feel like I'm way too sexy
Most the singers found me in the desert
Minimi-, minimi-
Handle my business, don't talk to me directly
No one above me actin' like they all so lovely
Recogni-, Recogni-
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Heels switchin', finger clicking
Kick on me like I'm James Bond on a role
They want the boot of my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
You need a neutral career
Look what we did in a year
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 4: Joba]
Oh, I'm lonesome, and hopeless
But hopeful, but hopeful
What's a boy to do lost in the world trying to find a balance
Sippin' out his chalice with its jewels dancing
Fluid like the potion
That pours when I get down some
Just trying to find a port in the sky where
The sun can shine down some
Jesus is lord, I put that on god
What more do you want from me?
He's in the dark, he's just a child
They turned their backs on me
Nevermind what it was
I see enemies
Don't want what's best for me
Best believe
[Bridge: Joba]
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, but hopeful
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, but hopeful

[Verse 5: Kevin Abstract]
'Times, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I been in my feelings on that island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said I tried vacation, I tried to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place, and a BBQ plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for ya

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now

[Intro: Jim Jones]
"You're not free with your Cadillac! You're doing just exactly what the Man wants you to do: Buy his goods, so you'll never have any real economic freedom. He wants you to buy everything he advertises on TV, so he'll keep you perpetually owing your soul to the company store. You're not free, you're a slave-!"

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz

[Verse 1: Joba]
What's with these superficial people from my past?
Dancin' 'round the fact that I did everything the motherfuckers bet against
They be like, "Gather 'round, place your bets!
This young man won't ever be shit!"
Well my bad, I guess I just pursued this shit
While you chose to settle down to have some kids
I mean, it's okay to fall in line, just don't look back
That's a long ass line that I'm not in
I just never found the time, or had the chance
Truth is, you can kiss my ass
Never been the one to bow down
Never been the one to air out any situation, but right now
When it's all your fault, I'm here now

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Thrift like a five hundred discount
I move it, I move it like Madagascar
Flip it like eight ball to inside of nose, it get raw
Bloody leaf color like fall
When you were calling, they said I'll be nothing
Well, suck on my dick and then lick on my balls
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Th-th-they want to boot up my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
Look what we did in a year
You need a neutral career
I hate on myself when I look in the mirror
Piddling voices all up in my ear
Why do I care how I look?
Why do I care what they say?
I do not care what they say! (Rrrah!)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk (niggas talk too much!)
They forgot how to listen (listen!)
'Til the prophets arisen
We mix New Edition with nuclear fission
I don't do auditions, I don't ask permission
Ain't no politician, don't ask my opinion
You got an addiction to what ain't your business
Make the admission, I make like magicians and hit my Houdini
Why they so soft like linguine? I murder this music routinely
I know that you see me, don't see you searching the meaning
I think that's why you won't believe and the future is leaning
Revolutions started streaming
The reason why you see me beaming
I'm dreaming of making moves like the government
You better think about who you fucking with, get back!

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't

[Bridge: bearface and dijon]

[Verse 1: bearface]
Taking time, faking mine
Let your hair lay on this side

'Cause I know the way to make-
You know I hate to lie
But you are, you are, you are baby
But you gotta be free

[Chorus: bearface]

Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)

Baby, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2: bearface]
Over eighteen with the windows fogged
Her brown skin with our fingers locked
Feel the air like it's sunny out
But I don't want you to go girl cause I'm tired of the waiting
Tired of waiting (ay, ay, yeah)
Tired of waiting, but you gotta be free

[Chorus: bearface]
(Freak ah, ah) Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)
Oh yeah (Yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah (Yeah)



[Intro: Jazze Pha]
"Ladies and gentlemen, lions, tigers and bears, giraffes, sea urchins, alligators and all that shit. I am Jazze Phenzel Burgandy Obama Luther King Jr. Jackson 5 the First, and I'd like to introduce to you Block Hemzell, AKA BLOCKHAMPTON! Oh, boy-ladies and gentlemen!"

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Thirty-two hundred on the jacket like Magic Johnson
Got a couple chains off Slauson
Silhouette lookin' like Charlie's Angels
I loose up with a drip of sangria
Wipe that smirk, life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up, like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I being too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else, I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Bimmer
Do my dance like ooh, la, la, when she strut like "oh my god"
Make me sweat like exercise, double up, milkshake and fries

[Verse 2: Joba]
I heard a call from the mountain top: "Joba!"
So I put my cloak on and I walked
Coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
Cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
We left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
Just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
Well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
Achieving wisdom from the wizards we were trying to be
Now other people from our village want to come with me
The thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
You did not believe, they did not believe
You can't tell me things, this was all foreseen
You're not one with me
I bought a horse with the shillings that you took
And then gave back to me
I met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
I bought a castle in the Shire with the moat and the catapult
I keep it clean with my medieval flow

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon and Joba]
Martin had a dream for a nigga like me to show up like this
Why you gotta hate? Looking at my pace
With your face screwed; hope it get stuck like this
Never even cared to appear or adhere my career
Trust me, you don't gotta touch my shit
Pulling every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
I won't be the one to rush that shift
Couldn't crush my gift even if I'm in a thousand pieces
Listening to menaces that pledge allegiance
To my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
Called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
Or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
All I know is they wanted to move without me
How they used to doubt me, but you can't renounce me
Like la, la, la, la

[Bridge: bearface]
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie, whoop!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Joba]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Niggas that I don't know, la, la, la, la

[Outro: Matt Champion]
Thirty-two hundred on the

[Verse 1: Jazze Pha]
...no pressure (no pressure!)
Like a pistol out the top dresser (pew!)
My shit bang, I get cash, all hunnid dollar bills, no chingaling
Cool like the other side of the pillow (aye!)
Caddy got white walls on it (skrr, skrrt!)
Big daddy got ice all on me (blingin')
Super clean like Lysol, homie (ooh)
You say it's some [?], I say it's a shame, but you would give me your body before your name
And I don't know why
And I can't explain
I, spin around like Michael Jackson (uh-huh!)
Reminisce 'cause I'm 'bout that action (uh, nah!)
Just wanna give some satisfaction!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract  and Jazze Pha]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
All my dogs in a pack formation
Niggas say my name when they agitated
Nigga learn better, you can ask yo' lady
Pretty bad thang, wanna have my baby
Nigga I'm rich, I'm just actin' broke
I don't understand what you hate me for...

[Intro: Matt Champion]

[Verse 3: Hoodie Trash]
Stop telling me that it's a phase
I can't tell you to your face, but
It doesn't matter if Rhys was a catalyst
I would go anywhere, I would go traveling
When I had a girl I felt nothing
No matter how much I wanted to feel something
When we kissed there wasn't a spark or nothing
When we split I didn't feel sad or nothing
Yeah I've got a fiery temper
2008's the only year I remember
Your boyfriend sucks, but that's not my problem
I understand that you need to move on
I sail the seas looking for my crew like
I got some loot but I still look broke like
Despite that I still sing my shanties like
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse: Ameer Vann]
I got some demons on me, they been feeding on me
When I sold prescriptions, and my pill addiction
Fuck the damn detectives, momma called the Reverend
I know she praying for me, but I'm in the shadows
Hella drugs and ammo, kicking doors, my MO
I got some bad habits, I do some shit I shouldn't
My life is on a scale, I know there's angels on me
All my dead homies, I know they waiting on me
Selling dope from out ya house, I know you praying for me
I know you used to trust me, I miss the chicken nuggets
And the kisses from her, damn I miss you momma

"This is Merlyn. This is what the sunset feel like in Malibu."
"My uncle used to have the lake house. We would go there every summer. Every Fourth of July, right after the fireworks. Go fishing, go swimming, take the boat out, all that. Get the whole family together, man, it was the best. I'ma buy that house back one day."

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I used to work for people
I made a couple hundred dollars, wasn't worth it even
I'm worth a hundred thousand
Not dollars but diamonds, I am mud out the bayou
Rip a page out the Bible, come and crucify me
I'm a long way from home and this ain't Yellowstone
I trade a white bitch for catfish and yellow bones
This from the catacombs, this for the broken homes
From the south side of cities where my granny home
I moved to California, I bring a Grammy home
I call up bill collectors, "leave my fucking family 'lone"
We left the corner store on the way to caviar
The coupe is mustard colored, what the fuck is Grey Poupon?

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Young K.A., never quit your day job, uh
I bring the love to work, I need the day off, uh
I need the [censored], this hard work should pay off, uh
The lights stay off until my mind is made up, uh
A young Zuckerberg, I wake up and make stuff, uh
These niggas copy us, they really need to pay us, uh
I'm from the city where your neighbors fight back
You talking shit, we bring that work right to your lap
I love my niggas like white people love rap
We make the shit you'll probably never say on track again

[Breakdown: Joba]
Walked through doors all my life, just to close them
Tore down walls all my life, here's to the other side
A whole new life

A whole new life
(Feeling the brand new feeling, feeling the brand new feeling)
A whole new life
(New feeling, brand new feeling, brand new feeling)
A whole new life
(New feeling, brand new feeling, brand new)
(brand new, brand new)

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract and Joba]
(A whole new life)
Back when I was hustling, ain't get no love from them (uh)
(A whole new life)
I paid my own bills and came up with the illest shit (uh)
(A whole new life)
I was tryna find a way to get my family out of it (uh)
(A whole new life)
Spent my days in basements tryna write a motherfuckin' hit
Nowadays he's stumbling, they show such love to him
I shut it down to every show, we set the precedent
I'm just tryna show these niggas, life is on some other shit
Keep your head high, smile when the trouble rumblin'

[Break]

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
I don't do what they say, it's unorthodox
Like bears sharing porridge inside with Goldilocks
Like Ozzy with no Sharon, he just called his parents
So fuck what I'm doing and fuck these damn critics
You should think for yourself, that shit is cancerous
Get my head rubbed by fingers of fuckin' hand models
Middle finger, fuck the hair up at all our concerts
Maybe if I cared less, I'd wear a hair net
But now my eyes, ten million by twenty five
Dropped out of Lone Star, booked flight from Lone Star
Was working a couple jobs and quit, became a star, uh

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Ready (Ready)
Go (C'mon)
Ready
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
How you read my mind better than me?
Yeah, you know I need you when I'm asleep (Ready)
I used to dream of a dream, you know I'm dreamin' that dream
Now my pockets too deep, I don't struggle these days
Yeah, I'm on TLC
Yeah, I'm stuck in my ways, I'm like a broken LP
Yeah it's most of the ways so we could all be free (Ready)
I'm a slave to these ways, dawg
I'm a passer go and wait to hear my plays, dawg
Used to run around the block, with the homies
Ding dong ditchin', takin' rich niggas' money (Ready)
Ain't a damn thing funny, used to dream of bein' Puppy
Bein' ugly ain't made me no money yet (Go, c'mon)
My music was soundin' crazier than 100 gecs
In the tavern, I be dreamin' 'bout gettin' back (Ready)
I was a loser, baby, so why didn't you kill me?
The record's dishonest, boy, so that's why they feel me
I'm still in this building 'til we on this motherfucker
Just a lonely motherfucker, I don't trust you motherfuckers (Ready)
On the speedboat, lookin' like a cozy motherfucker
So show off all your bodies, I ain't no phony motherfucker now
What's the real? (Yeah) Why you still here? (Yeah)
How you still hear? (Yeah) You boys shoulda been gone (Ready)
You thought I'd stop at fifteen, just the fall off
Freshman, BH, aight, nigga, that's all I got (Ayy)[Chorus: bearface]
Girl, I'm a star
Or just a lost cause
The medium is cut, burning, bright
I'm the light
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo[Verse - Dom McLennon]
-Some directions
I need you to follow, I'll never make an exception
I love that she held me and wished I would be protected

You always used to tell me, I could be anything I want-

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Automatic, make cash, get wasted
Automatic, make cash, get wasted
Make mama panic, boys talk to me colored
I'm a kid, damn it, I'm not a-



[Intro: Kevin Abstract, Henock Sileshi and Matt Champion]
Y'all know this is not a game (Uh, yeah)
It's Technical Difficulties
In the building (Yeah), in the mix at Club Kaufman
Represent the real
Technical Difficulties
Yeah, don't sit out
Go through somethin', blind new, don't got no new tools for now, they bounce it out
A-T-L, we ridin' 'fore the dawgs come out, bouncin' out
What am I supposed to do when we feel down and out?
Wonderful, hate that a bitch standby, feel so-

[Interlude: Henock Sileshi and Kevin Abstract]
L-L-L-Listen
Drop the drop
It's Technical Difficulties
You already know, yeah

[Verse 1: Matt Champion and Merlyn Wood]
Pair with me when the sun go down
Everybody lately wanna hunt shit down
But I all wanna do is just shut shit down
Back and forth, you gotta cut it out
Ain't in the mood to really argue now
What if they come up and throw you out?
Ain't tryna scrap right now
But I got your back right now
Small problems is all you involved with so don't be petty, shit, yeah
Don't be petty, don't be petty
We can talk it out, but it's hard when you are not near
Need you near, I need you near

[Chorus: bearface]
All that you wanted, oh, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more
All that you wanted, oh, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night (Yeah)
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Don't trust nobody, don't want nobody else
Love nobody else, no-nobody else
This is how the party start, real players enter
Lover, you don't love me yet, what you doin' later?
Floor filled with girls, pretty liquor on my sneaker
Shawty so full of sugar, I'm so glad I met ya
I wanna risk that for you
You can spend my time and my money too
There isn't one thing that I wouldn't do
If you was in danger, to get to you

[Chorus: bearface]
All that you wanted, oh, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more
All that you wanted, oh, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night (Yeah)
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more

[Verse 3: Joba]
Somethin' like fine wine, gotta sip it slow
Takin' my damn time, 'cause it taste right
Tow the fine line, white-knuckled and ready
Wide-eyed, so worth it and perfect
Guess I deserve it, quench my thirst in a drought
Savour every sip, all it takes is a call
I'll be there for anything at all
Prepare, you know I hold it down

[Chorus: bearface]
All that you wanted, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more
All that you wanted, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night (Yeah)
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more

[Outro: Jabari Manwa]
It's all night, yeah, I'm at your door
It's been a long night (Yeah), I caught your feeling for
For a long time (Yeah), you waitin' for it
For a long while, I know you need it some more
It's all night, yeah, I'm at your door
Yeah, it's been a long night, I caught your feeling for
For a long time, you waitin' for it
For a long while, I know you need it some more



[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I keep rapping with my kin
Back and forth, don't let them niggas in
I know some things some niggas don't
You are laughing with yo' friends
I keep rapping with my kin
Back and forth, don't let them niggas in
I know some things they don't

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
I wish you'd stop
[?]

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
See, I've been trippin' and fallin'
No more slippin' and stallin'
Got no numbers I'm callin'
Just wanna be in the coffin
All this trouble we've been causin'
Benz I'm crossin', I've been saucin'
Exercising my endorphins
Since you told me you were walkin'
I've been searchin', huntin', crawlin'
What's it costin' me? It ain't doing much
Tossin' me through a loop
I hush the voices in my head
For a minute so I can listen to you
And all I heard was
"I ain't listening", shit is cripplin'

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?
[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas on that word of mouth 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
Niggas on that word of mouth 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
Niggas on that word of mouth 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
Niggas on that word of mouth 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I got rubbers in my pocket, niggas like to gossip
If I need to drop 'em, let me know
'Cause I don't do much talkin', unless it's 'bout the money
If you got an offer, let me know
I was sellin cabbage, until I moved to Cali
Money in a mattress on the floor
Until I messed with niggas with fingers on the trigger
We was runnin', kickin' in the doors
[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas on that word of mouth til' they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I use protection, my nigga, so fuck your lecture, my nigga
And fuck yo' section, my nigga, I got the rest of my niggas
My niggas rushed on my niggas, my niggas love all they niggas
I fell in love with that nigga, that nigga skipped out the picture

[Verse 1: ASAP Rocky]
Listen, you look so different to me
It's like you barely even know me
You was missin' for me
Swear I'm tired of feelin' lonely
Like, field mob song, trill mob boy
She been MIA far too long, so far
Now catch the conversation, change the conversation
Dollars all I'm chasin', ain't talkin' money, fuck is you sayin'?
Non-comprehensive, money finish sentences
No, I ain't sensitive, nigga, just highly offended

[Chorus: Matt Champion and ASAP Rocky]
Bankroll, lump up in my jeans of that bankroll
Bankroll, limpin' when I walk 'cause of that
Bankroll, never show all them that green, I keep a
Bankroll, I keep a, I keep a, I keep a
Now I'm on my shit you try to get to me (Bankroll)
Every time I tell you differently (Bankroll)
You and him just split, you tryna get with me (Bankroll)
Money be my interest, gotta get the green (Bankroll)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
The topic today, be the wallet
My lady be spendin', investin'
Whatever you goin', I wallop
Now I get out departments, wylin'
Why my jewelry looking like tuition to college
Whatever you do, do not stop it
If you wanna salad all up in your pocket
I must be addicted to only the process
Walk up, buy the diamond, the riches
Whenever they hear this, I wonder what this is
Stop in the field like the different to bridges
I feel like, this year we run that shit back, and I better keep hittin'
One of them rings on the finger like Rodman and Jordan and Pippen
I had epiphany, I wanna three-peat
I split the wave and they glisten like [?]
Back of the truck with the stack like I'm Scooby-Doo
Waggin' that tail like I'm chuggin' Don Julio
Bitch in the back and they starin' like, "Who are you?"
Bangin that Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, that "Hootie Hoo"
Clutching my
Clutching my

[Chorus: Matt Champion and ASAP Rocky]
Bankroll, lump up in my jeans of that bankroll
Bankroll, limpin' when I walk 'cause of that
Bankroll, never show all them that green, I keep a
Bankroll, I keep a, I keep a, I keep a
Now I'm on my shit you try to get to me (Bankroll)
Every time I tell you differently (Bankroll)
You and him just split, you tryna get with me (Bankroll)
Money be my interest, gotta get the green (Bankroll)

[Outro: ASAP Rocky]
Nasty muhfucker

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
They try to take that from me
Want blood, they want me
They want blood, they want me
They want blood, they want me

[Verse: ASAP Rocky]
Bankroll, couldn't even fold, couldn't stay afloat
Bank broke, now I got way too many bank codes
Fake hoes, and my day rose, walk around my spare rooms
Lamb zoom, lear zoom, sailor moon, silver spoon
But I ain't no oil tycoon
And if I'm gone 'til November
Won't see my ass 'til next June
And it's true, and they broad day-time afternoon
Tryna spoil my mood, I'm tryna enjoy my cartoons, bitch

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood and ASAP Rocky]
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at the party it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place, always coming in your dreams

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
Dressed in the same shit I wore yesterday
Yeah, it's still fresh, never flexed cliches
I never write a verse and repeat the same thing
'Cause the sheen on my chains is my calling to fame
Made in the projects, slave to my progress
I only fuck a black girl if she wearing contacts
You ain't gotta talk you still blocked from my contacts
She hit me on my MySpace she ever wanna find me
I'm way too fly to drive, too drunk to call a cab
But I still need a ride to fit a couple girls inside
Oh what am I to do? I rent an Uber for the week
It's just another whip on my back, and we don't pay no tax
'Cause where I come from, ain't no body getting shot by the IRS
The trap ain't free, better realize that
But I'ma get money, no tests on the desk
Fuck the SATs, smoking Sunday's best
Find me in the ground, only time I regress
Six feet down, no I'm not there yet
Won't you meet me in the grave? I got grass on deck
So a grave like a slaveship, candy colored spaceship
Space like a white girl but ride like a Lexus
Leather with an accent, designed by Italians
But he ain't got medallions, so maybe he a Mexican
But really what's the difference?

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
I don't know difference
Mirror black and white like a pilgrim
Plymouth landed on me like a kickflip
Y'all repress this, oppress this
Question next is why my mentions so menstrual?
I be going ham on Ray Street eating tofu
Loiter at the Whole Foods, sipping kombucha
Yeah, I went green but the black'll still do ya
Damn, she used to be my number one, past tense
Past time chillin', evolved into the villain
Sunday school friends in search of second circumcisions
Nah, keep your opinions
We was mall rats just cheesin' for the pictures
Now who can circumvent us?

[Chorus: bearface]
She said, "Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?"
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Trade in that noose they put around us for a Cuban link
So my ancestors can see me shining, tell me what you think
I remember the illusions that they tried to move to me
That pollution still ain't stunt my evolution
What you choosing?

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
No chip on my shoulder, hunnid leagues under the sea (Hoo!)
We live life like cheetah power up like Hummer diesel
Golden chain for niece and nephew
Pessimistic, I do not hang 'round them boys
Metaphysics, need another dimension I can enjoy

[Chorus: bearface]
She said, "Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?"
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Reporting for the operation
I learned that the beauty is in the creation
I added my detail for decoration
So baby boy, what's the occasion?
You dressed like you 'bout to take over a nation
Avoiding social litigation
When that admiration turns into abrasion
Y'all can find another station
Otherwise, stay tuned, evolution coming soon
Rolling deeper than a dune
Howling at the moon, I'll be back in June
Told my baby I'd be back in November
Did some Beatles shit to kick off this September
Crazy 'cause in 2010, I had some old friends
That thought I'd be another-[censored]
Go fucking figure

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
If I pull up out the tool
Riding still up on the roof
Seems like only legends do
(Check this, hot lookin' babes!)
Bitch, and that's the fucking move
(I feel you, when she said-)
[Chorus: bearface]
She said, "Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?"
I make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?
I make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look

[Verse 4: Joba]
Good riddance, goodbye
Out of sight, out of mind
Cutthroat every time
This time, I get what's mine
Where the hell is your backbone?
Ducking me like whac-a-mole
Looking like an inflatable at a car show; a spectacle
Lick my finger, bet I found the wind
I follow that shit wherever it blows
You hung yourself, that's not my fault
I just supplied the rope, ugh!
Most thoughts, I don't think twice
Make decisions I'll die by
Never asked for the drama
But I'll turn it into dollars
Dollars, dollars, dollars
[Outro]
"Do you think about me?"
Ohh, ohh[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Smoking like five, six blunts in this bitch
My nigga Jon rollin' up, smoking heavy
Shout my nigga Jabari
I ain't been the same since my Grandma passed
Damn, damn
Ma ain't been the same since my Grandma passed
Damn, damn
She don't smoke weed to get high
Damn, damn
She only smoke dope 'cause her friends do it
Damn, damn

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
She don't give a fuck about no homework (She don't!)
She gone pop that pussy but give me dome first (I said!)
She pretend she love me until her throat hurt (She gon'!)
We gone need some rubbers and some more work (Ohh)
We be screaming like our TV don't work (Oh, oh)
Her Mama say to leave 'fore she disown her (Yeah, I'm on)
I don't blame her either took her from the church
Now watch me burn it down while I soul-search

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Now watch me, watch me while I burn it down
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
We be getting high, acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, we be getting high, oh, whoa

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
She only call me when she wanting to get high
Roll that weed, push them needles
Slide them panties to the side
Off that shit we gon' fuck through the night
Tight white skin, just the right fit for the night
Take another sip if you'd like
Another motherfucking bong rip if you like
You ain't going home for the night
Put you in that seat to the right
Coming home with me for the night
And I'ma get you high, take you places you ain't been
And never have to leave this spot
Melt here right here in the sky
And I can make it rain and watch it wash them sins away
So tell me, do you really feel lonely?
Waking up cold, you be calling out to hold me
To make you feel whole, just not so alone
Never let you go and we never coming down
And you ain't got no home, so we ain't got no problems
If all we need is drugs, then all you gotta do is call me
If all we need is love, then why is hate is what surround me?
Swallow all these down
And let these problems melt and drown me
Just drown me, just drown me
[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Now watch me, watch me while I burn it down

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
We be getting high acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, we be getting high, oh, whoa

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
She done flipped the pharma
She done flipped 'em, she done flipped those
All I wanna know is where you, ooh, ooh
Powder shower, down on you (Down on you)
Know you sour, no sweets from you-ooh-ooh
Baby gon' fuck till the night finish
She gon' suck till the life in it
She probably gone bite till the blood hit it
Got some Polaroid nudes, put a knife in em
You a bad girl (Bad girl), bad habit
Bad girl (Bad girl), good finish
Bad girl, gon' get it, read a bad girl like book, what?
She throw it, throw it back like a hook, what?
See, I don't wanna tell em who I love, no (No, no, no)
She gonna hit me like a plug, whoa
All we gon do is fuck on the floor (Whoa)
[Bridge 1: Matt Champion, Kevin Abstract, Joba]
Bad girl, no
Bad girl, no
She so bad, she so bad, she so bad, yeah
She so bad, she so bad, she so bad, yeah
She so bad, she so bad, she so bad, yeah
She so bad, she so bad, she so bad, yeah
She's a bad, bad girl, woah, woah-oh
She's a bad, bad girl, oh, oh, oh, woah

[Interlude: Henock Sileshi and another guy]
Bitch came through, you know what I'm saying?
She was bad as shit, she was bad as shit
Man, I'm telling you, man
I'm telling you, yo
She had that nice ass on her and shit
But, yo, yo, yo, Tim, Tim, Tim, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen
Yo, yo, yo, tell me, tell, listen, listen
If she got that thing man I swear I think she got that jungle fever

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
Then I'm Tarzan, homie, if she bleeding, tug it
Yeah I dropped my standards, my teachers aren't
Tryna flunk me down, they tryna hold me back
Fuck Kenan and Kel, man I ain't with All That
No, I ain't fight this hard since my Daddy put em up
I was hitting them trees in his big red truck
Came a long way from having my shirt tucked
And I still don't give a fuck, and I still don't give, uh, no I don't
Duct tape on my jeans, let it show, I'm a fuck up, let 'em know
I'm sorry, Mama, last time I cried was for my Grandmama
Could smell her like the flowers, Africana summer

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
If I had another
I'm a bad motherfucker
Got love for my mother
The city that protect me
I don't fuck with y'all like I used to though
But you could come around for the Houston baby, oh

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin

[Verse 2: Joba]
Who the Hell am I?
Who the Hell are you?
Don't waste my time, I got shit to do
Been in love with you, don't know what to do
Still searchin' for the truth, every which way
Mental foreplay, bound by cuffs to you
Do it my way, like everything I do
Take my breath away
Don't let me fade away
May die before I wake
Not the type to play
I take, and take, and take
Never want a change
Always wanna change
Used to count my change
Everybody changed
Memories of the days
I was young at heart
Matters of the heart
Rearrange, reactions in my brain
Redefine my pain
Been wishin' I could change
Hard to change my ways
Trained a certain way
Afraid of my own fate
Just another phase

[Bridge: Joba]
Lost cause and a lost child
Lost my way tryna change for the wrong crowd
I'm weak and I'll say it proud
Built me up, pull me down, let's air it out
Patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better
Just patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better (Make me better)

[Verse 3: bearface]
What a day, what a day
I just had a dream that you took it all away (Ayy)
Blow smoke in the face
I just hope your lil' bro grow to be great (Ayy)
What a day, what a day
I just had a dream where you took it all away (Ayy)
Blow smoke in the face
One in the clip, and one in the chamber (Yeah)
We was riding in the dark, you were putting your legs up (Legs up)
Girl, I don't know, maybe I should just stay shut (Stay shut)
Did I ruin your life baby, even from day one? (Uh-uh)
If it was another life, maybe you could still save us (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin



[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
It's impossible to change my attitude
Whenever I get into a new mood
I don't wanna meet no more new dudes
I don't wanna make no money with you
I don't wanna pretend to be friends with you
Niggas swearing that they cool
Niggas do not make me drool
Niggas swearing that they bosses
Bitch, I've been a boss since way before I had an office
I'm addicted to flossing
Why the wrist so glossy?
Look at the jeans, get off me
Look at my team, the starters
The jerseys, I'm Hercules
Yelling "Fuck the police!"
Niggas down south wasn't fucking with me
'Cause I left CC, 'cause my momma made me
We been done hated the law, nigga, this ain't new
Niggas won't quit, that's why I still bang Screw
That's why I hang onto the truth, the rule, the booth
The way I let loose rhymes slip through my gap tooth
But nigga, I got the juice
This me in my raw form
Diss me, you must be on one
Yeah, my nigga, it's my dog's turn
Yelling "BH!" while the blunt burn

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yeah, I chose to blast a light
We find the same black pool
Where my party people at?
You'll never break us down
Yeah, I chose to blast a light
We find the same black pool
Where my party people at?
You'll never break us down

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Excuse me, I'm not aware of the rules
Bump a little pie like the food on the cruise (Ah)
I got news for you dudes
Gunning for the crown like I'm over the goons (Uh)
What's the problem with your bitch ass? (Moody)
Attitude need a little dip in a Jacuzzi
Boy, you get the boot up out the window where the roof be
'Less you wanna take all this to Judge Judy
Shouldn't get your little panties in a bunch
I've been swapping flows like a home-packed lunch
Feeling down the face like the sun in the trunk
And I must be dreaming 'cause this shit is too fun
Look, I know I gotta be clutch
'Specially when the time is on the crunch
Etiquette, yes, I must be blunt
Fuck around and go tell 'em, "Wassup?"
I don't play 'em by the book
I don't cater like a cook
I don't project all my issues like I know a hater should (Ah)
I'm just doin' what I do
Lil' bitch, I know a thing or two
Don't do all that and then come through
Money makin' what I do
I keep a stack up in my shoe (Who)
Ready to shut it down (Who)
Ready to kill it now
Where my motherfuckers at?
I know you came to tear it down (Down, down, down)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Jabari Manwa]
Yeah, I chose to blast a light
We find the same black pool
Where my party people at?
You'll never break us down
Yeah, I chose to blast a light
We find the same black pool
Where my party people at?
You'll never break us down

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Phone ringin', never outgoin', homebody
Never outgoin', put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish addin' notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up, you should set it off
Tell me "Time's up," let the water run, let my body run

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)
[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die durin' sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimmin'
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Pick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleepin' with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinkin' deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
They said "Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?"
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me "Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?"
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Bridge: Joba and Kevin Abstract]
Everything I have (Is a mirror)
And everywhere I stand (Isn't solid ground)
People don't make sense (To me anymore)
I'm hiding out, again, tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out, uh
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky

[Outro: bearface and Ryan Beatty]
Everything you wear, I'll be the one to care
Softly, you braid your hair, all the angels stare, yeah
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Still trynna make it to tomorrow
My purposes redefining, but my heart still feeling hollow
I stare out the window of my Apollo
It feels like an Impala when I'm whipping thru' the cosmos, alone
Waiting for the reception from the other side
I built this shit to get away from what I couldn't hide
But didn't think that it could turn into my coffin, so far away from home
That love is foreign to my conscience
They said "do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me "do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame?

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why (why?)

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Phone ringing, never outgoing, homebody
Never outgoing, put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish adding notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wide out, wide out
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off kilter, off kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gon' make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a dead head zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't giving up, you should set it off
Tell me "time's up", let the water run, let my body run

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
My decisions, I ain't sure if they the right ones
My daddy used to beat my mommy, I would fight him
But I been thinkin' that I'm kinda just like him
I take a sip and then I go and grab a knife and
I take a drive while I'm high, suspend my license
I'm hanging out the window speedin' on the I-10
I'm headed west, out to Hollywood with my friends
I'm moving out and I don't care if you like it
'Cause I've been sleeping on the roaches, I don't like this
I'm going platinum, then I'm going buy a island
I'm in that water to the creases in my eyelids
I'm out in Austin, I got work on consignment
I met some niggas that was runnin' in apartments
Take the money, take the weed into the darkness
I turned heartless, the barrel barkin'
I break commandments Moses put on stone carvings

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I did business with a homie, now he trippin' 'bout some money
Partially, mainly trippin' 'bout percentages he wanted
Made the trip to California, made the album of a lifetime
Fuck this boyband shit, I just want a life line
I just want my mom back, my sister in a Cadillac
The black, she had the rims to match, the Twitter fuckin' pillow mat
I am not an activist, just because I like dick
Nigga, my existence is enough to end all this shit
I be studyin', 'lotta music coming out that I ain't
Fuckin' with, shit that we makin' sound like Southside
Dungeon shit, we the new Motown
Thugs with no guns 'round, friendship is gangsta
[Outro: Matt Champion]
All my life, I been runnin' with the wrong one
One slip up and I end up in the coffin
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
All my life, I been runnin' with the wrong one
One slip up, and I end up in the coffin
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
Holdin' on my motherfuckin' pride[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real-ass bitch
A real-ass bitch, bitch
What are the rules for breakfast today? (Grow it like a real)
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?  (Grow it like a real)
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real-ass bitch  (Grow it like a real)
A real-ass bitch, bitch (Grow it like a real)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
My niggas taking over
BROCKHAMPTON, call your momma
My niggas goin' platinum
Break necks, send you to the doctor
[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Best boy band since One Direction
Makin' niggas itch like a skin infection, mm
Did me wrong like a perfect stepson, mm
Been a wrong, you can change the song, hon

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
Who got me riled up?
Who the lame-ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, who got me riled up?
Who the lame ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, come get it from me, ugh
Come get it from me, ugh
Come get it from me
Ugh, ugh, ugh, come get it from me

[Verse 5: Joba]
Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Realign the spine, fuck the haters
Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Realign the spine, fuck the haters
[Verse 6: Merlyn Wood]
When you see me in the street, they say, "Willy, Willy!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Now I'm sad, everybody wanna suck my willy
When you see me in the street, they say, "Willy, Willy!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Now I'm sad, everybody wanna suck my willy

[Verse 7: Dom McLennon]
They be like, "What the fuck is you on?" when we hit the room
Move til' these niggas throw me in the tomb
Hear the sounds of the fader when we spin the tunes
Everything feel right now you in the womb
Wanna motivate you in the afternoon
Top-shelf money, that's my new perfume
Twist it up, light the end and inhale the fumes
I'm the one that zoom if you just assume

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
[Video Outro: Dom McLennon]
MERLYN![Interlude: Kevin Abstract]
"You know, I don't really remember the first time I got in that water, but I remember one time at my brother's birthday party. I jumped off the edge. I remember, as I was going through the air I looked to my right and everyone was doing GIFs and I just sunk to the bottom of that bitch, just sunk down. And I remember sitting on the bottom of the pool with my eyes open, knowing that I couldn't get up. Knowing that I couldn't swim up. And the craziest part is that I remember that but I don't remember how I got out. I'm still alive and, uh, yeah, man. Wear those floaties if you need 'em! Slow down when you get excited because, shit, you might just die."

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Jabari, me paddy

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Everybody ask me how I deal with my depression
Man look, man, I don't got the answer to your question
If I did, you would probably never hear from me again
That's a promise, not a threat and it ain't no half-steppin' (Hey)
Can't let it compromise the pace I'm settin' (Hey)
Grandma told me don't forget to count my blessings (Woo)
Breakin' up botanicals to ease my stressin'
Was the one that you needed but you weren't expectin'
Game need refreshin' (Hey), what you been suggestin'? (Hey)
Wrote a new constitution, we don't need amendin' (Hey)
I go Johnnie Cochran when I'm raisin' my defenses (Yeah)
Man, I feel like Michael Keaton when a nigga start ascendin' (Hey)
Never second-guessin' (Hey), had to do a lot of restin' (Hey)
Like I played for Popovich, tryna fine our new direction (Woo)
Listen, I ain't for the shelvin', what you niggas tellin'?
My team been rebellin' from wherever you were headin', goddam

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Man, this shit bump like a belly when it's pregnant (Mhm)
Bonafide big brr lookin' like a Yeti (Mhm)
Swift feet cheetah, that's a real big kitty
Who made y'all judges? That's a real ass feeling
I don't like the sly ones, forget 'em and I dead 'em (Yeah)
Always off the shit like a constipated reverend (Alright)
Y'all don't like to shit talk, dumb pun, all fun
But I make your bitch crack a giggle with the next one (Oh)
Goofy ass boy, look like Elmer Fudd's cousin (Sheesh)
Heavy-ass feet, bet Pluto heard you comin' (Shit)
Actin' like Regina, you a lil' bit dramatic (George)
I been in the cockpit, I been in the cabin (Right)
Take the ego out, just revolve around the planet (Right)
Damn, I'm like Kirby, man, I don't take damage
Oh, so hot, so, sst, get branded
I'm just havin' fun, cops hit me, goddamn it

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Trauma got me fucked up, my mama got me fucked up
My lil' nigga locked up, it's like Hakuna Matata
Never liked sci-fi, empathetic wifi
Keep it in the back room, hidin' with my dry eye
Put it in the vacuum, I got love for my label
Fifteen million on the table, none of my niggas is stable
Need a personal connection, I just wanna feel you, baby
Bein' sober made me realize how poorly I been behavin', uh

[Chorus: Matt Champion and Merlyn Wood]
My bitch, she so pretty, pretty (Mmh)
I get cash like really, really
Tell the DJ, man, he ain't slick
'Cause he ain't playin' hits, he silly, silly (Mmh)
My bitch is so pretty, pretty (Mmh)
I get cash like really, really (Get it)
Tell the DJ, man, he ain't slick
'Cause he ain't playin' hits, he silly, silly (Boy, bye)

[Verse 4: bearface]
Ring in their ears like a bark
Always feel left in the dark
Trauma the price for the patience
Character shift like an arc
Move like my shit stay in park
Don't feel the love or respect
Grip like a hand on my neck
This is the year, place your bets
Boy, bye

[Outro: Joba and Merlyn Wood]
Ooh, ooh, beautiful and bashful
Ooh (Mmm), ooh, ooh (Mmm)
I'm beautiful and bashful
Boy, bye
Goddamn (Sheesh)
Boy, bye
Boy, bye
Goddamn
I'm beautiful and bashful

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann and Merlyn Wood]
I feel just like Zayn, I feel just like Harry
I cop it and I flip it, have it sittin' on pirellis
Me and all my niggas, Southside One Direction
Tens and tens and tens and tens, got lens that make direction
Flow to my location, lowkey I'm in Cali
Just avoiding my probation, fuck your jurisdiction
Fuck the Federales, sold out by my father
He gon' feel the karma when I get the, get the commas, nigga
I don't have, I don't have no fear, nigga
Buy the ounce, sellin' ounces over here, nigga
I don't lie, I just bought a whole grill
Arguing with my bitch, my whip sit twenty-six, nigga

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Lowkey I'm a heartthrob and I ain't drop an album yet
I'm something like a poster, sitting on your girl's wall
And something about my face make her take her clothes off
Y'all say y'all got bitches but y'all bitches make my dick soft
Why y'all always mad 'cause I'm feeling myself?
What the fuck you mean, I can't feel myself?
Old girl suburban but now I'm on to new things
Ego like celebrity but real like a dope fiend
Tanning out in Hollywood, got Chantel's on my coattails
From motels to hotels, I'm good, bitch, I'm good
From hotels to motels, I'm good, bitch, I'm good
From hotels to motels, I'm good, bitch, I'm good
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]

They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
In the city I'm a menace, I give CEO's the business
Marathons I gotta finish, foreign whip is speaking Yiddish
Lately, I been feeling vicious, why y'all crying like some infants?
You don't wanna be a witness?
Then you better mind your fucking business
All these crumbs on my denim, we the only dogs spitting venom
Been some years I tried to tell them
But they wanted me to be the villain
They just wanted me to lose, ones I loved would make me choose
Had to cut the ones I thought I'd take to the top
Just so I could make a move
Dropped out of college, smoking the same campus
Tell me 'bout limits
Last year I was suicidal, took those thoughts and tried to kill it
Used to avoid, used to being paranoid, huffin' with my boys
Pack it up, I shake the world like asteroids
Give me love before you try to give me noise, I destroy
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys

My mind is glued to your mind (Hmm)
I'm like, "Bitch, why you wastin' your time?"
With them other motherfuckers that you keepin' on the side
Now you killin' my high, get the fuck out my ride
Like, any niggas could be your situation
And everybody ready to go in on presentation
I'm so impatient, I know Heaven's waitin' just for Hell to raise
They don't really feel better when my hands is raisin'
Up in the sky and we ain't doin' no praisin'
And outside the sun off, you can hit me later
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
Are you braindead or are you stupid? (Are you stupid?)

[Verse 1: JOBA]
Meet me outside
It'll be alright
Got drugs and we can share
Let's lose our mind tonight

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I'm a slave to my feelings, uh
I made bread with my niggas, uh
I see that man in the mirror, uh
And I've been dying to kill him, uh

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
I told my nigga I'm good, mm
If you got it, you should, uh
I was addicted to wood, uh
I'm coming straight off the Suge, uh
School had doubted the bosses, ay
Sick of counting my losses, uh
We kept our hands in the closet, uh
I kept my heart in the faucet, uh
He took the train and was off it, uh
My balance stuck in his pocket, uh
Relax and be easy, uh
I taught you, I'm weaker, uh

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again
And wait
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again
And wait
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again

Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again

[Verse 4: JOBA]
Spent the night outside your house
Drunk as ever, can't get better, and can't do better
You say I treat you like a sidepiece
Bought a Beretta, fuck a fella
Dressed in all black tryna find a way back to your mattress
Where I can relax
Where we would just laugh
I could kill him, don't like to play the villain
But I've been feeling bent
I cross my heart and hope to love
What's wrong with that?

[Verse 5: Merlyn Wood]
(Can you turn me up on my headphones?)
Treat me like a kook, the weather getting good
Mans will manifest, they gon' see the way I cook
I said it with my chest and became a different dude
Skrt off in the Hemi
Work hard, not for pennies
Imma make that money if I'm outside sellin' green
Just for Japanese denim
I gotta be fresher than you
Last year I was destitute



[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
So I built you a house

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Tryna find revenge in the dark
I think I know where you went
Tryna find your spirit is hard
I think I know how to spend
My weeks are evil
Your brother don't want me here
Your family hates me
My parents don't know I'm here
It'd be better if you loved me
But he told me love myself and that's true
It'd be nice if you could help me
But he told me help myself and that's true
The sky ain't gon' be fixed tonight
I know for sure the sky ain't perfect (Ohh)

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I'm swimmin' in a sea of regret
The more I sink I forget how to swim
I try to breathe, I know the feeling too well
Of fighting myself, I'm losing again
Why am I here? Cold and alone
The sea ain't a home, but it's still where I lay
And still to this day, bad credit with karma
Lighting blunts underwater
Still ain't goin' too well, so I keep to myself

[Verse 1: Joba]
Thank you for your patience, but it's too complicated
This time I know better than to trust you one more time
Fame is overrated, and I'm not even famous
This time I know better than to trust you one more time

[Refrain: Joba]
Picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down
Picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down
I'm just picking up what you are putting down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Murder, I hear bloody murder
Murmurs from observers in my head that might disturb ya
Bleeding with the burner, can't be a preserver
Just might crash the server if we take this any further
Bitch, I'm on point like a cursor
Play to smell like concrete if you want it to get firmer
Terracotta, terra firma
Through the shadows we emerge, uh
Kept outside the water until they cannot submerge us
Watch these bodies earn, ugh

[Verse 3: Joba, Merlyn Wood and Dom McLennon]
Suckin' on kinky binkies
They put the pole in their derrieres, we drink milk straight from the titties (Titties)
She call me daddy, play truth or dare (Truth or dare)
Lysergic acid on gummy bears
Sour or sweet like the Chinese chicken
If the booty bouncin', I stop and stare

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
Said, "Change your clothes," like Pharrell to Jay
Prolly wearin' how I feel today
Bootleg Versace, platters on the platter
We servin' these niggas like B2K
Roll paper planes of that MIA
Bari got visa, he here to stay
Niggas is talkin', they do not play
I game for keeps like I'm Dolla, Dame
Niggas know I do not play when I run in this beat
Niggas know I be runnin' in these streets
Like I'm a vagabond
Everything I do I fuckin' get ratted on

[Verse 5: Merlyn Wood]
Do what I want
This what I do what I want
I see it, I like it
Now it's in my pocket
Off the top, off the topic
I'm off the top, and I'm off the topic
Doin' shit off the topic
She wanna sloppy top me
I'm not that naughty

[Outro: Kevin Abstract and Joba]
You a freak hoe
Ooh
GINGER Radio

Okay, BROCKHAMPTON on Sway
Nah, nah, okay
He just love to skate
And you know a nigga got an HK
Man, I got an HK

Not watchin' any day
You just go and say okay
I got the camera up front
Now you all about to be on YouTube
Now you see me on YouTube

I don't know what to do, do
I'm just rappin' on Sway
Ian, go and take it away
You got it?

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Mic check, mic check
Mic check, mic check
BROCKHAMPTON, never threatened
Never feel pressure from the threat
I could've been Nas, I'm more like Lil Nas X

Part III

[Verse: Merlyn Wood and Joba]
Right here, I'm right here baby (Right)
I'm right here, I'm right here baby (Right)

Dodging' any obstacle

Part IV

[Intro: Joba and Merlyn Wood]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Bounce baby, bounce baby)
Ooh, ooh (Bounce baby, bounce)

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Watching' my life change in front of my eyelids
Saint without a God, I represent for the hybrids
Was ridin' out through the city, when somethin' hit me
Just to go on and say fuck anybody not comin' with me
'Cause there's only one of me
Without y'all, there be fifty niggas
Really must be silly, I can break it down so simply
To a point where you would figure and nearly forget what I'm sayin'
What can I say man, I guess I am a rap genius
King flow, only seven queens on my penis
Iceman, you can see frost on every anklet
Rollin' up the greenest, Odd Future, you couldn't dream us
Saw my life upon the floor, went to go pick up the pieces
I really broke it down
Like I was a Mobb Deep with the choir sound
Quiet storm, when I go with the violent form
Everybody know I'm spittin' in my final form

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Final form, yeah, you see me, bruh
I used to have blond hair like Vegeta
I used to be smokin' that reefer
But I ain't smoke today, Sway
How Sway, how Sway?
Sway, are you okay?
Somebody tell me
I'm hot, somebody jail me

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Bitch, I told my dogs that I gotta ball
I'm from Texas, so it's all y'all
Catch me, bitch, that's a trust fall

[Verse 1: JOBA]
A broken heart is the [?]
[?]
I can't complain
No one to blame, I am sensitive [?]
Forgive me for my feelings
But when I got that feeling
I'm way too supersticious
Let me know where I went wrong
And maybe we could [?]
Have been all on my own

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Hey, don't waste another minute
Gotta get the bag and then I'm in it
[?] and we finish
No way, no way
Cause no matter how [?]
Imma get all of your [?]
Imma be in love, Imma be in love, someday

{Post-Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Someday, someday yeah, someday yeah
(Someday) Imma get it
(Someday) Imma get it
(Someday) Imma get it
Someday
[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
She goes [?]
[?]

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
So I go
I just want you to know
I love my people back home
But I gotta take it slow
Never take it slow[Intro: Matt Champion]
Tuggin' on my pinky ring, smelling like chrysanthemum
I just want that, I just want that bump, bump in my trunk
Blowing skunk, getting crunk with my baby, oh, what's up?
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
We gon' ride, ride, ride down to Mexico
You can see the bad man, I'll come to New York
You can't catch him though
You can see the bad man, I'll come to New York
You can't catch him though
We gon' ride white lines all the way to Mexico
Merlyn, Merlyn!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live (Ahh!)

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I've been trappin' out my momma house
Dope boy money keep the water and the lights on
Spray it, like it's Lysol
Your bitch don't like the dark so we fuckin' with the lights on
I fuck her with my chains on, you the one I changed on
I just won the ghetto lottery, I guess I'm hood-rich
Chillin' at the gallo, smokin' Blacks with my hood bitch
You ain't what you could be, come get on this dope dick
I sell it by the gram, now tell me who you fuck with
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live (Ahh!)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me operate
I ain't here to talk now, nigga, we ain't gonna conversate
This modern terrorism, you can't moderate
I've been fiendin' time to put these demons on display
'Cause they don't understand, I don't give a damn
Smoke some shit straight outta Alice in Wonderland
BROCKHAMPTON the clan, bitch, I ain't your man
Like they're stacking just to crumble like an avalanche
This is how it stand, this is how it is
Bitch, I ain't your friend, I ain't havin' kids
'Cause I know that if I'm gon' bring him in the world
My little spawn of Satan just might take off with your fucking girl

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Bust your head inside my Camry
If I ever see your camera
Bust your head inside my Camry
Yeah, yeah, I'm sweeter than a motherfucker

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood, with Ameer Vann]
Bust your head inside my Camry
If I ever see your camera
Bust your head inside my Camry
If I ever see your camera
Bust your head inside my Camry
If I ever see your camera
Bust your head inside my Camry
If I ever see your camera

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Huff, huh, huh, huh, huh
Huff, huh, huh, huh, huh
Huff, huh, huh, huh, huh
Huff, huh, huh, huh, huh

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I'm the elephant in the room, demon under the bed
Genius within the walls, monsters inside your head
I rebel without a pulse and saddle into the dead
So give me all of your dreams and I intertwine all the threads
Reality by design, [?] dread
I listen to what they say, it's what I'm goin' against
It's what we goin' against, it's keeping me up at night
I'm killing all of that shit that's made interfere with my sight, huh

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Wanna eat shellfish, belching on the balcony
Fuck a Lambo', I feel better in a Camry
If I see some candids of me, it get to duffing
If I see some candids, you ain't seen nothing
We don't do NDAs, we just do fists, man
'Bout to blow a stickman fuckin' with my shit, man
Big business money comin' just like a tidal wave
I don't roll the window down, I just do a small wave
Keep my feeling concave, my trust underground
When the cameras come around, you will never see me 'round
Round it out, throw it up, just in the roundabout
Just like a rollercoaster, fuck away from me, man

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
Sell it by the gram, money loves my hands
I pull a few bands out a plastic bag
And it all add up, I'm real good with the math
I turn a quarter of the gas to a bundle of cash
They always come back for what I put in the bag
From my bones to my skin, I'm a businessman
I know cash is the law, you could lose your head
Get shot in the back and you could lose your legs
Niggas sing for the feds to avoid the pen
They atone for sin, I don't trust no men
Cops raid my house off some shit you said
Niggas strapped with mics, they'll take your life



[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
This is everything I ever wanted though
Dreaming of a candy store
Brother couldn't tell me more, no, so
I need moments where I could be left alone
Yeah, she let me ride along
To a place where I belong, woah, though
If you niggas ever get your money right
Would you still be robbing niggas?
Would you still be lying to yo momma? No
Don't you know I do this for your family?
'Cause mine ain't believe in me
Left my hood so easily
Eat, sleep, wash sheets, repeat
Watch teachers teach

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
High and on the damn sidelines where the bleachers be
Always feel like city streets, wish I was back in my sheets, shit
Most days I don't wanna be me, shit
Don't watch this, teen watch TV, shit
My whole family look like some Gucci shit
Shoutout my hood, they racist as hell, shit
I'm 'bout my papers like some damn immigrants, bitch

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Merlyn Wood]
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas still fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been set up

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I cannot explain it
Dropped down to my knees beneath the stars and started praying
Life put me here for a reason, I am not complaining
Look me in my eyes, I'm not here for your entertainment
Do you follow?
I ain't here as your role model
That pill is way too big to swallow
I hollowed out my path
Borrow all my sorrow but don't expect me to take it back

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I been dripping candy paint, grew up Willow Avenue
Turned a right on Yellowstone, you see what them players do
So I chuck the deuce who make us home to Herschelwood
And shout out to my cousin Mo, he got off a prison sentence
Lock him in a penitentiary, he ain't takin' niggas with him
Or his daughter either, so send the lord to keep her
'Cause the police killin' fathers, man, it hard to keep 'em
And that's what's in my blood, besides the oil and reefer
I'm in the black slab, tryna catch the reaper
It's a four inside my cup, I crack the seal and fill it
It's a hole inside me, I try to pour and fill it
But in the bottom, another monster, there's somethin' with it
I'm still that little nigga with the little twisties
Waitin' for the bus, and I just missed it
That's why I'm still hungry, why you robbin' niggas?
That's why I dream bigger, fuck a couple dollars
I want a hundred million, and one for all my niggas
And twenty for my mama, she need some bigger ceilings

[Bridge: bearface]
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Merlyn Wood]
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up



[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
This about love or hate
Lately I'm losin' faith
Don't know what happened, there's some distractions that I need to erase
I need to choose the pace
Brother we raise the stakes
Niggas be thinking they makin' a move but they dumb they ain't movin' a place
Don't think I can't be replaced
Probably gon' make a mistake
Missin' the simpler days when no one was around and no one could betray
I throw a gram on a tray
Put all my problems away
I'm sorry, mama, I'm sorry, papa
I told you I step and they want me decayed
Propaganda on display
Leaving rentals in the states
I ain't tryin' to debate, niggas dyin' out and they know I'm right
When they call we generate
Baby calm down, hesitate
They can try to make a plan for me, man, I'ma have to deviate
We be stressin' but ya make
That's when they collaborate
Tryna take away my peace of mind, lost some piece of minds to the state
Nigga I can't take a break
Mental on the dire straits
I'm the greatest still a waste
I just gotta concentrate

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Blow hunnids, loneliness isn't new to me
We dunnit, this is not a murder mystery
McDonald's, I was broke, in paradise
I spill Capri-Sun when she said the price
Fuck me right, masturbatin' to my Insta likes
Rappers turnin' boys, boy band turnin' into zeitgeist
Follow me rights, wanna be famous, piracy the price
Merlyn walkin' to you across the screen, like it's redlights
They gettin' all my teams, tell us 'bout that action
I need a white-man Mercedes, I'm a champion
Fifty-six, the browns, two floors, one roof attached
That's why we tighter than her bacon pack
D'USSE, makin' hella lo mein
You don't even understand what I'm sayin'
But you just bop your heads and fuckin' listen
Give us a name, give us something, fuck it, give me

[Chorus]
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
Let's do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully (You don't want no problems with me)
You see me?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
Let's do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully
I'm 'bout peace so, we should do it peacefully (You don't want no problems with me)
You see me?

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Rollin' in my truck (Uh-huh), gotta keep it tucked (Uh-huh)
Cause whitey wanna fuck with some niggas like us
Confederate flag (Uh-huh), neighbors call me "fag" (Uh-huh)
Gotta keep it low, I keep that thang up in my bag

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood and Kevin Abstract]
Whose society is this? Who delayed my first kiss?
Who command my scholarship
And kick us out our neighborhood?
Play our music, make 'em rich, play our music, make amends
Box us in like plantains, free all of my Africans
There go that danger boy, danger boy!
Nigga, I slay, nigga, I waste them, them, waste them

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Oh-hoooo!
There go that danger boy, danger boy!
Oh-hoooo!
[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
Niggas kill you for a dollar, listen to 'em holler
Big blood ballers with a crown on my corner
Crack and marijuana, slab around the corner
Sitting low on elbows, syrup on the dashboard

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
I got a dream I'm willing to die for
I got a team I'll commit a crime for
Got some dead homies I ain't get to cry for
'Cause I'm working for my freedom, while the world cry war
Cry wolf when the shepherd finds a way to strike gold
'Cause the stocks gon' crash and the dollar gon' fold
You don't know that the poor eat the rich when there's no profit
They gave you the floor but you brought up the wrong topic
So it's
[Outro: Joba]
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world

[Interlude: Kevin Abstract, Merlyn Wood, Dom McLennon]
I got all my money saved, I'm with them boys my momma hate
That's fire
I take the time to celebrate, ah...
Ah, hah, ah, hah, I got all my money saved, I'm with them boys my momma hate. I take some time to celebrate, my hands to the sky
That's so good
I love that
What made you think of that?
It just felt right, coming after Dom's verse, yeah...

[Intro]
Too many, too many times wasted

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
Wait a minute where my dogs at?
Players who ain't scared of love's at?
What's the point of saying "Fall back?"
Reaper gon' come  and stall that
Karma comin' where your false at?
Let em stunt on us we floss back
I keep my treatment to the sky, let my friend fly
Feel like y'all don't notice how I peace of mind
I got a lot to say and much to think about
Shrugged the haters off my back now I'm relieved of doubt
Lookin' deep into the ocean tell me what emotions that you dream about
I just want devotion from the moments that I [?] when I'm screamin' now
I'm lookin' for a partner that I'll share my pain with where we gon' do the same shit

[Part I: chain on]

[Intro]
One, two

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell them boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga
Tryna say
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell them boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga
Tryna say

[Verse: JPEGMAFIA]
Fifth string, Young Peggy ring (Go)
Slick with the ink, these melodies need Duolingo (Shit)
Same size as Dua Lipa, where the fuck my pen go?
Second fiddle to weirdos, you feel like Eddie Winslow
Street Fighter like Birdie, keep a stick like Rolento
Did you win if your purpose is just perfect potential?
Did you live up to it, is you just doin' the minimum?
Used to get fifty views, now they need Peggy's momentum (Yeah)
Let's check the addendum
Switch the code, I'm speakin' prophecies, like That's So Raven
Bald headed with lil status, I feel like Maven
But I be dressed like Raven, up in the studio slavin'
Wonder how Peggy be- (Wait, wait)
Wonder how Peggy be cakin'? I be Easy Bakin'
My oven stay prepped and ready for the heat they takin'
Niggas that took this road and failed ain't have proper placement
Some of you niggas don't look well, does Peggy make you hate him?
Is it how I make the beats sound like Poltergeist? (Huh?)
Or when my homies bring my name up is it breedin' spite?
It's all talent, perfectly balanced, young Supreme Kai
Who am I? Wake up every morning like it's do or die
No surprise, dudes get jealous when you cut the ties
Livin' life, Lance Armstrong at the finish line
Give it time, when we catch them cops on cam
I don't need six seconds, you remember Vine
It's nasty
[Part II: hold me]

[Intro: Method Man and KRS-One]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all, y'all
Of course all the hardcore heads
This one goes out to you
Crank up the volume one time
Peace to all the real DJs out there
Cause I don't send my music to no garbage DJs
They get me
Woop-woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop-woop, that's the sound of the beast
Woop-woop, that's the sound of da police

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Stuck in the wild, murder with a smile
The only child to make it up out the mud (Yeah)
My fingers bloody, my tooth is kinda crushed (Uh-huh)
The rush I hate is the one that you love
Fingers crossed (Yeah), crisscrossed, applesauce
Rugrats, writin' raps, quittin' jobs, runnin' laps
Who was that that found the coke in your bag?
I was hopeless, we would laugh, on the lawn doin' math
Ayy, ayy, I need some new genes, I admire your blue jeans
I admire your mood swings, I admire the whole thing
It's gettin' lonely in Cali', yeah, it's so sunny though
Still got hope for the bloke over there with the runny nose
If I could keep your eyes on me long enough
I could prolly trick you into thinkin' that I'm right enough
Like I got it all together, tell your fam' I'm bright enough (Nah)
Keep my crew tight enough (Nah), give me the time, I'm ridin' up
(Nah, yeah)
[Break: Gil Scott-Heron]
It stands out on the highway
Like a creature from another time

[Chorus: Joba and Kevin Abstract]
Hold me by surprise (Hold me by surprise, surprise, yeah)
And try to remember yesterday (Yesterday, ah, you)
Hold me by my head (Hold me by my head, head, yeah)
And rinse away the pain of yesterday (Yesterday, ah you)

Verse 2:
Fam's french like oui oui, baguette
I'm in a play, she call me on set
I said, hey, girl, what's happening?
She just checking in, cuz I'm flattering
Susan scared, but it's seasonal
Tell her I'm hella undefinable
Haters say I'm unbelievable
Well guess what?
I'm god, man, anything's feasible
I meme em for a reason
I be spitting fire like a demon
Sick em all, call the bois with the beacon
I can't help it cuz haters in season
Guys, they "love" me all of the time
You asinine, while I terrorize
I was memeing em up in a past dead life
Yes I'm god, but I'm past divine, yo

Hater don't make no cash
Find some ass
Put a god's mind in a bag

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Stuff 'em all in the projects
Niggas taking our profit
Niggas talking for profit
I'm a prophet, that's [?]
A boyfriend, that's toxic
I want them to stop it
Took a sip and I hopped in
Fucked on my white friends
And learned from my black ones
Yo, I'm definitely my dad's son
With the soul of a Jackson
And the [?] of a Jordan
They rob my nigga for Jordans
[?]
Bleach the BLEACH plaque golden

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Need me a check
Nigga I need me a check
See how they puttin' my kin in some checks?
See how they puttin' ideas in my head?
I don't understand, go with the plan
Look at my poems, look at my hands
Look at the set, [?]
Dreaming is cursed, [?]
Need me a, need me a, need me a check

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Niggas said G's in the front
What should believe me
These niggas is demons and [?]
They made a deal with the devil
Had LA on [?]
Stick to your truth cause it's all that you got
In this world full of demon scum
Jesus Christ, don't touch me [?]
I need you to fall back you scaring the [?]

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Imma keep the bill for a wild one
We don't need nobody, it's been a wild run

All I know is
You a bitch, bitch, bitch

(Verse: Kevin Abstract and DJ Bobbito Garcia)
Pardon the, uh, Technical Difficulties
Less money talk, world peace baby
How many more times my team gon' see the (?) baby
Still in the heat baby, I'll buy the seat baby
See these trees baby, hanging 'round me baby
No Grammy nom, world phenomenon
Yeah I'm righting wrong, bread from writing songs
Pushin' [?] the timing was just right
I wouldn't have them thoughts without any of the rights
And I'll marry you now, [?]
Switch religions like a maze did, we ain't Christian right
I see the dollar sign where life crash, after the desert
But we did it together so I love my dawg forever

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
If I gotta swear on that forever, I'm not tryna
I'd get it right, Oh-oh
If you're gonna hate on me forever, can I change
And get it right, Oh-oh
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up

[Post-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
If I gotta swear on that forever, I'm not tryna
I'd get it right, Oh-oh
If you're gonna hate on me forever, can I change
And get it right, Oh-oh
(I got my back tonight, I got me)
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up
(I got your back tonight, I got you)
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
(I got me, I got you)
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
And I've got your back tonight
I've got you

[Intro: Matt Champion]
Why you look like that? (He looks crazy as fuck)
He look crazy as hell
But he dress well (oh my God)
Why his face look puff?
Why he look like that? (You look like a)
Why your hair like that? (Like a chipmunk or something)
Why your teeth like that? (Or like a prairie dog)
Why your cheeks like that?

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I got this shitty moustache, and a new haircut
Short but tall enough to ride every ride so it's fair enough
Teeth crooked but my breath fresh just like the evergreens
My attitude is bit like, a psys- fuck!
You mean psychopath
I bet the marble feel good on your bare foot
I'm in the backyard hiding out like I'm Bigfoot
And I won't cater to you
Yeah I am not Carrabba's, and I ain't taking orders
Here for the loot, and to inspire some of you
To do what you do despite all the "fuck you's"
'Cause they shit on your shit, stab you right in the back
'Til you're shittin' on the toilet with Grammys in your lap

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Niggas talk a lot of shit, in a safe place
Aiming with they keyboard, they shootin' uppercase
I'm booking tour dates, money in the suitcase
Commander and the chief like, Barack Hussein
Same nigga, two names, I am onto new things
Flying out of Houston, lemme say a few things
I don't give a fuck about you or your screen name
I'ma be a star even if I say the same things
'Cause them same things keep me on the wavelengths
I dropped another verse, so you gon' have to pay me
Glock with no safety, seen niggas on the pavement
Over gang affiliations, guns with extensions
Seeing niggas get anxious, all these internet gangstas
I'm running outta patience, nigga, stick to your day shift
And watch what you're saying, and please keep praying
'Cause niggas talk big 'til that price on their head
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I feel the voices always drown out all the noise in the room
They don't employ you for your purpose, they just need a platoon
Another number in a line ready to march into tombs
I ain't the one to assume, I put the coon in tycoon
We colonizing the moon, I see you look to the sky
And start to wish it was you, sometimes I wish I was me
Sometimes I'm watching my life
I'm dissociated from what eats my heart up at night
Sleep on a cloud of my strife
I ain't afraid of the heights, they all afraid to appall
I'm just afraid of excitement being a trip to the mall
I need a summer to fall, I need a winter to spring
Got all these seasons within me, building a story to sing
Don't need a dollar to dream, I need a billion in facts
I need a trillion in wealth, y'all niggas need to relax
I wanna build up the culture, they wanna dream in the trap
I took the zoom off my lens and I saw the world in my lap

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the

[Verse: Matt Champion]
Motherfuckers actin' flagrant, yeah
Streetball, no NBA shit, yeah
Seein' double, heard the mumbles all around
Rides gettin' out the days, yeah, yeah
I would think you're outta pocket
Switchin' up on all your topics
Eyes just side to side
Mighta stepped, you ain't like confrontation

[Verse: Rodney Tenor]
I want your number in my telephone
So that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone
So that I could be the one tonight
I want your number in my telephone
So that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone
So that I could be the one tonight
I want you in my (oh, oh)
I want you in my phone, before I let you go
I want you in my phone
I want you in my, in my, in my arms again

[Chorus: Dom McLennon]
Falling for the wrong one
Feeling like the right time
But at least I felt something
Think I'm losing my mind

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I'm in need of your love, I just need you right here
Sharing all of those things, whispering in my ear
Tell me what they can't know, show me what they can't see
Tell me all the ideas, they would never believe
You see I remember my home
I remember those trees, I remember those pasts
I remember the breeze, I remember the reason why all of those people that passed
Remember you opened your heart for a second
Gave me your time for a minute
Remember the tone in your voice when I told you that I might be coming to visit
But maybe I'm tripping
You catching me slipping
Down this road again
But this time I ain't falling
First day back 'cause the demons keep calling
Look at this world and I start withdrawing
And its so hard not to fade, see its so hard not to fall
But I gotta find peace
And I gotta find sleep 'cause I don't see it at all
So I'm going, going, going, deeper and deeper
You see I'm finding it out before my spirit gets weaker
I got a fever, fever
Been feeling sick in the head
I need a doctor, doctor
Or just one more cigarette
I'm saying
[Chorus: Dom McLennon]
Falling for the wrong one (I love you)
Feeling like the right time (I love you)
But at least I felt something
Think I'm losing my mind

[Bridge: Dom McLennon]
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don't act like you ain't heard that
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don't act like you ain't heard that
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don't act like you ain't heard that
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don't act like you ain't heard that

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Oh yeah she fine
Soft from behind
Like I'm running out of time
Yeah she hurt your fucking feelings with that
Ass of hers
Dunno just to what I'm feeling with uh-
Get on her
How cannot tell I'm feeling its like-
I'm in her
World, living, breathing
You know I'm not even Steven
'Cause I could not be
Shia born in a house fire, damn
Baby, where you do that
I'ma little bit insane, yeah
Put you on game, yeah
Make you maintain, yeah
Stay up in your lane, yeah
Whatever you say, yeah
Alway-always say yeah
Rather see me dead, yeah
Than see me in your bed yeah, yeah, yeah[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Not everybody I know holdin' onto daylight (jeeeee)
Not everybody I know holdin' onto daylight (jeeeee)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Damn it I won't go, dammit I won't flow
Damn it I don't ride on my own plane, doing my own thing
Still in this boat
I feel alone man, I'm so alone man
All of this rope
Let me inside, where did you go
I need a seven to let me to glow

[Verse 2: Matt Champion and Kevin Abstract]
I been in my stride, think I need an ice bath
Hit my hot spot so I do it like that
Mind of a predator, you know I bite back
When my eyes stay close know I love it like that
Lick-a lick-a sticker with a stamp of approval
Rumour flick that you get down like a gasoline lamp and it's see through
Straight through the vines, [?]
Ruffling the minds
Couldn't see all the signs when the [?] 'cause I got so far from the vines
Could you resemble a python in the wild after God didn't let you
Fly with you, be able to guide a child in this world
Pressure in the sky, think God want a diamond
I never lie with my mind
I'm up down, like a geyser
Double milkshake, large fry 'cause nostalgia
Stay stay sleek like a croc in the water
See bad times, sharks flying, lemme alter
You believe in no falters, no trial
No error, just terror (one more?)
[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Not everybody I know holdin' onto daylight (jeeeee)
Not everybody I know holdin' onto daylight (jeeeee)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Driving in silence, looking for guidance
I lost my licence, I lost control, I miss all those islands
Quarter-life crisis, handle ill profit
Whipping this wrist so long non-stop imma get arthritis
Walking like giants, checking my shadow
Making sure the clouds don't catch on the wounds that share my battles
Holding that gavel, twisting these axels
Holding my heart to stop this riot
Swear I'm trying my hardest to keep my pride
I know I'm inside, these metals they gave me violent

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I pray I find you at the bottom of the hill
I pray I make it outta Texas
I pray my A/C come back on
My mom was stuck outside her job
My sister just asked for a Lexus
Can Jesus send me a message?
What's the point of havin' a best friend if you end up losin' him?
World don't view my text messages
World don't view my text messages
Don't view my bad side
Only get on the 'Gram to show you motherfuckers the best side
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Why I hide? Huh
Fourth grade, Mary J. Blige all I like
I made a mill' off a lie and a lie so I write another lie
RCA, that note wasn't 'bout y'all
No lies, it was about how me and my brothers been traumatized
And I must keep creatin' truths and hooks to get up outta this hell for myself
Seashells

[Chorus: Joba]
Dearly departed
Look what you've started
I've been so heartless
I try, I try, I try
Why?
Why?
Why?
Try

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Big dog, I feel like I don't got anybody on my side no more
Highs to lows, truth be told
It's hard to ignore, hard to endure
Where's my stamina in this life?
Make sure my family tight
More rubies on my neck and they catch me at night
Lookin' immaculate, no one in sight
Standards are high, expectations are low
Wake up sweatin' at night, mind in a flight
I don't get scared no more when I'm standin' on the mountaintop
I'm afraid of people dyin'
Rest in peace Wako, Ray, Rita
Wish you could've took me to Japan
Back ten years, holdin' my hand, felt like a hundred grand
Wish them letters didn't fade, love will never do the same
Out the window screamin' your name, bless it
Mama on track, my dad got my back
My sister graduated, now she racin'
Love her through the days and whiskey in my hand
Bloody colored trinkets wrapped around my wrist
Lookin' magnificent, man
No stoppin' me, no boggin' me down
I know myself, me and the obstacles now
I done shit on myself too much to not know how to move properly now
On the property now, money gets foul
Keep your wits about you
They stretch the truth longer than the Nile
Eyes full of evil, mouth full of vile
They tracin' your smile
Stay alert, big dog
Only one life is offered to you
(Only one life is offered to you)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
How many sides to a story can there be when you saw it with your own eyes?
I got all my thoughts out on records y'all won't ever hear
Tried to give it time
Find that truth trickles down, hits the fan
Freezes over like a dagger to the spine
When somebody that you know throws you in the fire
How do you survive?
I kicked down the door inside a home I didn't own just to save a friend's life
Little did I know, the one who pulled the strings was once on my side
I had just moved to Texas, tried to make it right
I do not feel obliged to dismiss the truth because of how I feel about our time
If I knew what you would do to someone you owe money to, you wouldn't get a dime
Watch for where you land, sorry 'bout your plans
That was all a scam, you won't understand
Pass the weight off to your friends and never face the truth
Because you never learned how to be a man
And it's not my fault, and it's not my problem anymore
That's just where you stand
That's just who you are
That's your cross to bear
You could talk to God
I don't wanna hear, motherfucker



[Kevin Abstract]
Back by popular demand
Hoppin' out the sand, with the mic up in my hand (What!)
Back by popular demand
Hoppin' out the sand, with the mic up in my hands (What!)

Pay attention, Pay attention
Studio glisten, never listen
Pay attention, Pay attention
Studio glisten, never listen

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
If I told you where the dope was
You ain't supposed to be here, nigga you don't know us
See boy I am focused
In my garage making magic this is hocus
Gone loco, voodoo I sue you
The devil gon get you if it's not the ruler
My black skin made me wanna dress more cooler
Hiding alcohol in my family's cooler
I'm tired of life boy
Last night I had a dream, I put that on my white boy
For too damn long my life was McDonald's and white boys
Now it's like white noise
I need me some nice noise
I need me some nice [?]
I need me some new clout
The game niggas turn on you
Fame niggas run from you
Laugh and hold my hand baby when it's convenient
I need me some street shit
Fuck this PC shit

I don't wanna rhyme
You keep wasting my time
I don't wanna ride



[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Southside, brought the wave back (Yooo)
Hair nappy, need a wave cap (Yooo)
Same state where Trae at
That's the reason for the mothafuckin' ASAP
That's MOB, nigga (Naw!)
Why you all dressed up, why your teeth messed up
Why you look so lost, nigga (Hellooo)
Don't get it twisted, down in the Dirty South
All we do is floss, nigga, that shit lit
Boss nigga, that one me
Ain't got time, can't no nigga take mine
That shit our shit, lose it? No way (Uh, uh, ow!)
I'm over it, I'm over it (Ow!)
I'm on and in and out it (Ow!)
I'm nauseous, I'm nauseous (Ow!)
It hurt to think about it, oww!

[Pre-Chorus: Joba and Kevin Abstract]
I've been riding 'round with my people (Uh, Dirty South)
And I always put it down for my people (Uh, uh, Dirty South)
She ain't ever caught them Southern feels (Uh, dirty south)
But she gon' catch them southern feels

[Chorus: Joba and Kevin Abstract]
'Cause I get it while it's hot
I get it non-stop as I watch that body rock
Swanging through town, banging through town
Let me slow it down as I get my money right
Got this ice on my wrist, candy painted Lexus
Finna' hit a lick with my squad
Got a muddy cup of the purple stuff
Take a puff, get buck, feel the Southern love

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann and with Joba]
Scumbag from the Lone Star state
Come around here?
You could be the next nigga on The First 48
Niggas run around with a snub .38
Gotta hold it down and protect your 28s
'Cause since 18
Nigga had a dream of that thang on the spokes
Got my mouth froze, got them thangs on the low
Who the fuck spoke?
Don't mind my southern drawl
Got a pocket full of stones for all of y'all
If he up, then watch him ball
Plot to make these niggas fall, shoot through walls
Take they money and they keys
And don't come back without it all
Screaming, "Fuck 'em and we ball"

[Pre-Chorus: Joba and Kevin Abstract]
I've been riding 'round with my people (Uh, Dirty South)
Always put it down for my people (Uh, Dirty South)
She ain't ever caught them southern feels (Uh, uh, Dirty South)
But she gon' catch them southern feels

[Chorus: Joba and Kevin Abstract]
'Cause I get it while it's hot
I get it non-stop as I watch that body rock
Swanging through town, banging through town
Let me slow it down as I get my money right
Got this ice on my wrist, candy painted Lexus
Finna' hit a lick with my squad
Got a muddy cup of the purple stuff
Take a puff, get buck, feel the southern love

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Sock tan, pack of 'Ports
Dirty bitch, might double-cup her (Double-cup her)
Smokin' gas on the porch
Guess you could say I'm burning rubber (Burning rubber)
Head is good, so I learn to love her
My dogs talk in numbers
My iPhones got iPhones
So all my friends can talk to me (Hello?)
My flip phone even switch lanes (Ayy)
My bitch got that lipstick (Oh!)
Like candy paint, lick it off
Fuck me, then piss me off
Alexis, get my ren' on
Alexis, get my ren' on
Curve me, curve me (On what!)
Bitch don't hit my phone, CUT!

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon and Matt Champion]
Heard everything's supposed to be different 'round here
Gotta make sense of shit 'round here
It's like everybody wanna hit a lick 'round here
Guess I gotta stop giving shits 'round here
Been looking for a sign or some shit 'round here
Grind hard just to get a fuckin' grip 'round here
We don't sit 'round here, big shit 'round here
You a target if you don't fuckin' fit 'round here
Better charge it to the game, nigga (Charge it to the game)
We all going insane, better find a fuckin' lane
Doing digits in a Range, nigga (I don't even got a car)
No guts, no gain, no pain, no fame
We are not one and the same, nigga
I could change your whole life, we don't need no hype
Just to get shit lit for the night
We could set it off on a fuck nigga on sight

Pushing weight (Moving weight, nigga!)
Got to educate!
Niggas smoking on my scholarship, anhh!
That's a win-win (Mrrmrmwah!)
Allowances off these college kids
BROCKHAMPTON thicker than the Wayans, man
I'm an asshole, run up in su casa
And dun dun dun dun dun da-da dun-dun (Nah, nah)
They deported my uncle (Stop that!)
'Cause he ain't got the papers to prove it (No!)
Mama sent me to that white school (Not Black!)
Prove I could speak like them white kids (No!)
Act like them white kids (What?)
Smoke like them white kids (What?)
Fuck that! (What?)
I'm the all-Black Johnny Cash!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Let me find my way out of this bitch (Uh)
Find myself high in the distance (Uh)
Find me up, lying in this ditch (Ugh)
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin' (Woo)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Ugh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Ugh)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Ugh)
Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner
Let me find my way out of this bitch (Ugh)
Find myself high in the distance (Ugh)
Find me up, lying in this ditch (Ugh)
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin' (Woo)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Ugh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Ugh)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Ugh)
Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Ayy, I'ma just bounce with that
In fact, I bought a whole damn house with that
Ayy, hand me where the ounces at
Tell me where the damn these ounces at
Ayy, tell me where the ounces at
Tell me where the ounces, ounces at
Ayy, tell me where the ounces at
Tell me where the ounces, ounces at

[Verse 2: Joba]
It's getting hot, you best just-
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
The effects can't touch this
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
Stand up, stand down, bitch
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
Wait, wait, wait

[Verse 3: bearface]
I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I
I ain't ever been the one that's scared of you
Baby, you can come and get it
I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I
Baby, when the karma gets you, yeah
Maybe you can run away with us

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
In my bag in the vault, moving on, move along
Ain't my fault, moved too fast, life had skidded to a halt
Got back on the road and made it to the start
Disregarding the emotional discharge
Can't forget the mission put into my heart
I ain't playing games with you to play your part
Standing up with pride behind my battle scars

[Verse 5: Matt Champion]
Money walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable
Big-ass house and big-ass car don't add up when you die alone
I want wife, nice life ,highlights with some little clones
I want bliss, no strife
Rewind, don't slice around my aura with the better lies
I want a better life, bend around the corner
One deep, eyes shut, really know the place
Projecting on me, I don't correlate
Straight from manipulation, wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers
Still wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone
Always throwing curve, like a reaper scythe
Gnawing on my wood like a termite
Entering my world like a parasite
(Parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite)

[Verse 6: Joba, Kevin Abstract]
Praise God, hallelujah! (God, God)
I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience
Paranoid, can't find that shit
Woo, praise God, hallelujah! (God, God)
I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience
Paranoid, I can't-

[Breakdown: Kevin Abstract]
Let me find my way out of this bitch
"I'm Sammy Jo, and my favorite colors are, um, black and red." (Damn)
(Ugh) With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin'
(Ooh da-aa, da, da, da, da)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Ugh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Damn)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Ugh)
Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner

[Outro: bearface, Kevin Abstract]
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you
Light it up, better dodge the cops
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks
I, I miss you lots, I, I miss you lots, I, I
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots
That's all I got for you
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks, I, I
That's all I got for you
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you
That's all I got for you
Miss you lots, I, I miss you lots, I, I
That's all I got for you
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots
That's all I got for you
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks
I, I miss you lots, I, I miss you lots
I, I miss you lots, I, I miss you lots, I, I
That's all I got for you

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
And if I had to do it all again
I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more
Now and then I think about you and I want to be your friend
Do you like the sound of that?

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Ice cold, I told you I'm ice cold
Find another way to put all these diamonds on
Lookin' through the window like, baby, I'm shinin', whoa
I know that you wish that I could come home
I almost [?], I wanna [?], yeah
I like to [?], you niggas is my [?], yeah
Fell like if time would froze, I feel like the mind and souls
It's too late and now it's time to go home

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
And if I had to do it all again
I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more
Now and then I think about you and I want to be your friend
Do you like the sound of that?

[Bridge]
Run while you can, little boy
Run while you can, little boy, it's a cruel cruel world
Run while you can, little boy
Run while you can, little boy, it's a cruel cruel world
I know, I know, I know

[Chorus]
And if I had to do it all again
I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more
Now and then I think about you and I want to be your friend
Do you like the sound of that?

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Mhh, I do, I do, I do like the sound of that[Interlude: Dom McLennon]
Hello, beautiful humans. This is Dom McLennon right here speaking to you. You know me. Over here at Things We Lost in the Fire Radio, we about to give you everything you need. You need this song: Skylar Spence - "Why Do You Wanna Dance".

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I sold that dope in the dormitory
I know my roommate informing on me
I told my momma she shouldn't worry
Start taking student loans from the country
I will pay that shit off 'til I'm forty ('til I'm forty!)
I don't want to have to make McFlurries
Sellin' students single sacks got boring
My college kids facing keys like both quarters
My thug life to every lad sandstormin'
Set up shop, exhibit product like it's a car show
The shit is pure man, while he sell the Sweet'n Low
Catchin' hell in my BM convertible
Deep Dallas in the winter, place so hard
Put that gold jump rope on the floor

[Chorus (Reversed): Merlyn Wood]
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
F-fuck with the cops, they beating the cases
I see the pistol 'round waist and they aiming
White doesn't fly with carnations, they pain me
Family need a little sleep and serenity
Popping cherry cola like her virginity
Confidence sink on the brink of a better me
I keep an eye up on your bitch in bed with me
Knowing that you will just bet on the death for me
I got the fragrance, throw me the cologne
Sipping so long, they love your cologne
Fuck the percentages, I want the leverage
I want the leverage
I be reserved, I do not blurt
Keep out my face with your petty little urge
Life like a blur, learn 'bout the curves
Skin and my body, I've been insecure

[Chorus (Reversed): Merlyn Wood and Kevin Abstract]
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Joba]
Yeah (yow, yow, yow, yow)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I am from another dimension
Better step to me with nine hitmen
Freeway Ricky I'm a line kingpin
This present moment's a divine vision
Saw my past and took a dive to dig in
Couldn't make myself a pot to piss in
Motivation lacking my decisions
This felt like a holy intervention
I put that pack in my undergarments
Them boys had locked the pharma department
Packing up pills at the base apartment
I didn't taste it, thought it was garbage
Never had figured to ask who grabbed it
Noticed my friends had developed habits
Men and women both reduced to savage
Just to satisfy what needed scratching
MDMA mixed with bad karma
Spliffs from Newport's rolled with marijuana
Someone broke and sold the plug
Sent the law to his moms to put a slug on 'em
Boys woke him with the straps out
They ain't know about the stash house
Couple decades got evaded
'Cause he moved the last piece before he passed out

[Bridge (Reversed): Kevin Abstract]
Self, hurtin', hurtin' my
And I got diamonds that's hurtin', hurtin'
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my, hurtin'
And I got diamonds that's hurtin', hurtin'
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself

[Outro: Joba and Kevin Abstract]
I keep dancing dancing
I keep dancing dancing
I keep dancing dancing (yow, yow, yow, yow)
Dancing, dancing, dancing



[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Yeah, go sit out
Cold soul through, black know 'em, don't got no tools for now
They both sit out
A-T-L, we grab him 'fore the dawgs come out, bouncin' out
What am I supposed to do when we feel down and out?
Wonderful, hate that a bitch stare'll make me feel so magical, like
You would sit back, hit that three now, got a three and O
Got four and then my Deage come out, weavin' out
Nothing really ever come easy now
Grind it down 'til the world feel unbelievable
Leave you now, I can't even-now, now, now, now

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Yeah, that's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
And that's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
First couple racks, just spend it on some new Chanel (Ayy)
Caught a whiff and now, ooh, got that new smell
Pushing in that G-Wagen, I wonder how that coupe feel
How is you feel? Uh, grinding too, still

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Yeah, that's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside

[Outro: Ryan Beatty]
That's the downside
That's the downside
Shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm workin' too hard

Try and same my name and I'll try and play your game
If you love me like that, love me like that
Tryin' to be lame, but don't matter if you're starin'
Got me starin' right back, starin' right back[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I ain't never made of nothin'
I'm always hittin' the change button
My publicist ain't say nothin'
Just to keep me out of trouble
I ain't never made of nothin'
I'm always hittin' the change button
My publicist ain't say nothin'
Just to keep me out of trouble (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Just to keep me out of trouble, ah
Last year we hit a double, ah
Told my niggas add another, yah
Shit was smooth, no fumble, yah (Ooh)
Then I dropped when we tussled, ah
Back then when we struggled, ah
No one cared about the juggle, ah
Can you see me, ee?

[Chorus: JOBA]
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
All these voices on the sidelines
Feel like doubting lies, like what's in my head
Difference is a year ago, they were not there
Difference is a year ago, they did not care
Difference is a year ago, nobody felt like they would have to tell me, "Don't forget where you come from"
But I loved my city when they didn't love me
Ain't it funny when you in that conundrum?
I ain't one for all of your corruption, nigga
I don't move at your presumptions, nigga
Now we ride your repercussions, nigga
Do we look like fuckin' stuntmen, nigga?
I ain't gone, I ain't function, nigga
I was overdue for an eruption, nigga
You ain't even have the heart to face me when your problems changed me
Go fucking figure

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Just to keep me out of trouble, ah
Last year we hit a double, ah
Told my niggas add another, yah
Shit was smooth, no fumble, yah
Then I dropped when we tussled, ah
Back then when we struggled, ah
No one cared about the juggle, ah
Can you see me, ee?
[Chorus: JOBA]
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
I woke up on tour bus
I woke up on aeroport
Man I really dropped out
With no promise this would work
Man, I really dropped out
With no promisin', promisin', promisin', promisin'
You an astonishment! You an astonishment!
Look at my conglomerates, look at what we did
They said we was kids, was tryin' to live
Instead we made millions, boy I'm resilient
Boy we made millions, boy we made millions, boy we made millions

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Now we ain't gotta wait 'til devil
Big guilt cop over the sinner
To Ruby set black through the canyon
I spit on memory lane
Our lovin' is all that remains
Dust off and I'm keepin' my pace
I'm talkin' to wind today
Chalk it up, it's weird today
My momma pop bottles, it went to the roof
Laughin' and smilin', now keep it on loop
Food for all of my wounds
In times of solitude
[Chorus: JOBA]
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down

[Verse 4: Matt Champion, JOBA, Kevin Abstract, JOBA and Kevin Abstract]
I'ma work it out in my lifetime
Wouldn't trade it all in my right mind
I'm too drunk tonight, pack a punch, I might take a bullet for you
(That one day someone--)
To be truthful, I'd hate on me too
'Cause no one deserves what I want, no one is worthy
I'm selfish as fuck, I know that it's wrong
At least I admit it, I wish that I didn't
I don't know why I do it, always had the feeling
That one day someone would listen, listen
Maybe this route ain't what it's made out to be
Even though I wanted it forever
Never in my life has it been so hard to be
Maybe I could be better, maybe I would do better
If it wasn't so hard to be myself
When you get to shinin', they'd rather see you dying, nobody likes it

[Outro]
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it

[Spoken Word: Henock Sileshi and Ameer Vann]
Ha ha! Yo (Woo), that last one was amazing, them boys was hot

What the fuck is a Scotland? (It's somewhere near Greenland)
Or Iceland
He... yeah, he, he not from here y'all, he, he from the, ah... the eh, the, not the America (Mm hmm)
The other parts



Evanie
Did you lie to him since you were seventeen?
How's he holding up? Evanie
Do you cling to him like you would onto me?
Bet he needs you more than I, Evanie
Did you hide your neck to save him from his sleep?
I know how that feels, Evanie
Every chance you take you make me want to flee
Can't you see?

You should move on
Swear you'll be fine
Whenever you want
I'll be your ride
And when you're alone
And his love is gone
Maybe you'll see that
Your company was the worst
Thing for him, your sin



Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: KRS-One]
Of course all the hardcore heads
This one goes out to you
Crank up the volume one time
Peace to all the real DJs out there
Cause I don't send my music to no garbage DJs
They get me

[Intro: DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything

[Verse: Matt Champion]
Fuck this humble shit, I'm 'bout to run it like a track star
No introduction bitch, I'm 'bout to go that hard
Champion, got the goggles after finals
Sprayin' champagne, askin', "Where the fuck the cork goes?"
Mouths like flamethrowers, down South, all blow
Comin' for the throat like that lil' bitch was down on all fours
Moncler on toes, from the dust I rose
Walkin' on the air, guess the gravity's what I oppose
Hatin' ass dog, gettin' back up on your tip toes
I done seen a lot of y'all worked at Kinko's
I been goin' every night, tryna strike gold
We been itching' for that feelin' like a blown nose
In the kitchen, whippin', flippin' 'til the stove blows
Still a student, I am fluent far as prose goes
Five years ago, nothing, not shit
Five years later, five hundred K, just to spit
And I still can't believe that I ain't done talkin' my shit
I know your ass ain't heard of me
I ain't stopping' 'til I die, just occurred to me
Mo' money, mo' problems, fuck the other ninety nine
Just turned twenty-five and I ain't even in my prime

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything
Yeah

[Outro: Henock Sileshi]
Regardless if you fucking know their name or not
BROCKHAMPTON is a household name, my nigga
Like it or not, it don't matter if you like it
I know that, [?]
Every little sugar
Oh, honeysuckle it
Woo, a crazy expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't be
If a thousand roses
Just wanna [?]
[?]
These are in the making

[Intro]
"Take it all or leave it"

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I can't sleep like I used to
The world will try to tell you who you are before you get to
Explain yourself, your thoughts
Your motives and all of your reasons
Two albums every season, what the hell do y'all believe in?
Why the hell do y'all keep reachin'?
In the evenings when I see 'em
I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
Need something new to believe in
'Cause these new niggas'll change on you
I mean they change on you
Why the hell the BBC only writes about me
When it comes down to controversy?
What about three CD's in one year with no label?
Then we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable
I was that nigga in a room
With no motherfuckin' cable and no table
Now my mom call me whenever she need her car note
Cellphone, whatever bill paid too, y'all niggas losers
You don't understand why I do what I do, so let me do it
Get the hell on, let me do it, get the hell on, let me do it
[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I don't speak like I used to
I'm thinking of a way to change the world that I move through
I feel like Nikola, what I invent is what I'm true to
I feel for Nikola with these ideas that I grew through
I know that when they see a brilliant mind they'll just abuse you
It's hard to feel what's real, some nights I'm scared that I'm delusional
I'm scared I'm more like Nikola than I'd ever collude to
I'm scared of what can happen when ideas will consume you
'Cause there isn't room for peace I can achieve

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Stay rough, get buff, get out, hey, boy
Stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
[Verse 3: Joba]
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it

[Verse 4: bearface]
Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people?
I don't know these people, I don't know you either, no more
I'm at war with myself
Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself
And they coming for my mother, sending bullets for my head
Think they fallin' in love but I'd rather be dead
Please just leave me alone, I don't wanna be read
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
[Outro: Merlyn Wood, Matt Champion, Ashlan Grey, Jabari Manwa, Joba and Romil Hemnani]
It's the best years of our lives, motherfucker
You are now about to experience
These are the best years of our lives
I feel you

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Looks like it's one of those nights again
I told the devil that I got him in my sights again
Life's full of cycles and I'm hopping on my bike again
The energy around the light could cut just like a knife my friend
We just some carbon based life forms spitting hydrogen
Sometimes I wind up so the gears inside my mind will spin
Switching lanes, 110, I know they like to pretend
Don't try to sleep cause they might take your dreams and cash them in
Consume the pack and clap for all the ones surpassing trends
My bones are black, my blood is red, my brain a javelin
They play for paper, but I'm safer with my oxygen
Wave like tsunami, with this proxy, everybody wins
Pass on my posse till they start to photocopy them
Life after purpose had me in the game but out of it
So it's no time for folly gotta point out all the counterfeits
I'm counting on this gift to guide me to whatever's right within
I've been divisive, now I try to stay above the fence
Need all my soldiers till we over every wall and trench
You'll have to pardon us for contact marijuana stench
I thought to switch it up but then remembered that this flow is rich
With history. Your come up is a myth to me
My vision monolithic and my aura is a mystery
Step beside the critics with an effortless delivery
My presence is a symbol of my victories
They wrapped inside their misery

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Stay rough, get buff, get out, hey, boy
Stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys

[Verse 2: Joba]
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it

[Verse 3: bearface]
Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people?
I don't know these people, I don't know you either, no more
I'm at war with myself
Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself
And they coming for my mother, sending bullets for my head
Think they fallin' in love but I'd rather be dead

Yeah, yeah

You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

[Outro: Merlyn Wood, Matt Champion, Ashlan Grey, Jabari Manwa, Joba and Romil Hemnani]
It's the best years of our lives, motherfucker
You are now about to experience
These are the best years of our lives
I feel you

[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
It feels like I can see the past in your eyes
I know the future has been passing you by
These other niggas, they just passing your time
They don't know how to ride the tidal waves
That crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe
Then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean
They boxin' us in but we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want
I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for you
I'm taking a stand for you, I care for you
[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
What's your motive with me, baby?
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head, 'cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect, sometimes, I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
'Cause I know thousand men want ya, wants the menages
Fucking, riding shotgun, slap your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and the sun
85, 90, gon' bust out the gun
Know they sent me from the neck of the woods
Change my name, state so they never could

[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?
[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I need a friend (I need a friend)
And you need a home (You need a home)
I love when you come (I love when you coming)
I still feel alone
You make it warm in my bed
Butterflies in my head
Sunrise, let it set
But you don't love me like you say you do
White lies hold the hidden truth
You keep leaving when I need you most
It's true what they say about love had and love lost
Here you are and now you're gone
I'm left alone in the same bed, I wake up in a cold sweat

[Verse 4: Joba]
Please don't make me wait long
I just wanna be your main one
Your main, your main one, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you, mm-mm
I spent the day by my lonesome
Who do you call when there's no one?
No one ever did what you did for me and did to me
My bed is cold and indented where you used to sleep
Tell me what you're waiting for, shit
Tell me what I'm here for
[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
Nigga, talk shit, I'll single you out
If you've got a problem, we can figure it out
I'm from H-Town, but the gold in my mouth
Southside niggas put a hole in your house
A hole in your spouse
Better think twice 'fore you open your mouth
It's getting real close to the first of the month
Niggas hit licks, for the gas and the blunt
Send 'em to the doc, gotta open them up
Niggas load guns in the back of the truck
Niggas hate money til they laced with gold
Gotta get a gun for your hateful foes
Flex too hard and your casket close
You don't want your momma come
And get you from the morgue
Tall white T, blood on the floor
Oh, don't say that

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Ohh-ohh-ohh, I feel like Master P
I ain't no slave, ain't lettin no one try to master me
I'm getting tested, tested, but nobody passing me
Ain't sugar coating shit, don't need them extra calories
It's a machine, that's why we work inside the factory
Put 'em up for me, display it, like it's a gallery
Don't need your salary, gold on me, like it's alchemy
Giving niggas the battery when they witness the mastery
Oh, don't say that, don't talk to me, we don't play that
They got chalk for me, I make outlines, like it's pottery
I got a squad full of fucking oddities
I got squash, apricots and broccoli
We turn weird shit to a commodity
I'm on a odyssey for real quality
It's like, oh

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
I look like a Somali pirate (Don't say that!)
Failed middle school and college (Don't say that!)
Daddy say I'm an asshole (Don't say that!)
Dick complexion of a Backwoods (Ew, don't say that)
She text me, dry as the Sahara (Aw-wah!)
After she get in that casa Merlyn (Straight up!)
I was in that mouth like flouride
That pussy tight as a hair tie (Ah! Ooh, ooh)
Scrunchie, I'm so horny, baby, bitch, your house, pussy, baby
When I get the munchies I steal, I don't share roaches, baby
Bum with the good haircut
Bum with a good haircut, mattress and magic dick

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone



[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
My male role models drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up, I learned what racism was
And what teaching it does, and like my teachers would say:
"Little Black boys have a place in the world
Like hanging from trees, or dead in the street"
Like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies, I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginning and end

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark, I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave, gentrifying my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb, refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey; see, your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money, don't care to cater to merit
Y'all fetishizing my spirit, I see your culture's dependent
On what you didn't inherit, won't let my world be attempted
I'm staying distant

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Merlyn Wood]
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
Who gonna be the reason why I get high? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the reason why I get high? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over? (Bloodsucka!)
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust? (Trustsucka!)
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped? (Bloodsucka!)

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Bum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em
If I catch 'em slipping, they gon' have to meet the eagle
Bum, bum, beat 'em, treat these niggas how I see 'em
I don't need you either, send you right back where I seen you
Bum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em
If I catch 'em slipping, they gon' have to meet the eagle
Bum, bum, beat 'em, treat these niggas how I see 'em
I don't need you either, send you right back where I seen you

[Outro: Ameer Vann and Merlyn Wood]
In the game, in the game, in the game, in the game (Bloodsucka!)
In the game, in the game, in the game, in the game (Bloodsucka!)
Running thangs, running, run, running, run, running thangs (Bloodsucka!)
Running thangs, running, run, running, run, running thangs
In the game, in the game, in the game, in the, in the
In the game, in the game, in the game, running thangs
Running thangs, running, run, running, run, running, run
Running thangs, running, run, running, run, running thangs



[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
But who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
And I got a bonus but I ain't seen it yet
I've got streaming money, I ain't seen it yet
I got a bitch that love me, I ain't seen her yet
I got a bitch that love me, I don't seem depressed
I can't adjust, I can't adjust, I can't adjust, I can't adjust
Takes confidence, the confidence to conquer
These motherfucker shake hands with these fuckers, traitors
Thank confidence, the confidence to conquer, conquer
I don't shake hands with no motherfuckin' cowards

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I been smokin' nigga, fuck my drug test
Block get hotter, need a bulletproof vest
I been runnin' since I hit my first lick
Seen that chopper turn that dog to a bitch
The money is dirty, these niggas launderin' it
Stashin' the weed, we run from the lawmen again
And the sheriff is comin', he think he caught me again
But the barrel is barkin', he ain't walkin' again
And I ain't playin', I'm in the game like E and A
And runnin' thangs is in my veins and DNA
My flow is colder than eskimos and Himalayans
I speak in tongues but niggas know just what I'm sayin'
I'm thinkin' different like protozoas and atom splittin'
But niggas shootin' and runnin' out of they ammunition
I keep it movin' and only ride if my niggas with me
And we ain't scared, my niggas swang and hang with me

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
One body, two body, pressed in a room with nobody, body
Grab yo' engine like Bugatti, seen bubbles in Bali, Bali

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I was gettin' bald touchin' sands in the moonlight
You was gettin' old, each summer could move right
Lips slide to cheek, last time that I seen ya'
Rugged buck eye walkin' down by the beaches
Hardly acknowledge the fact that I love you
Practice voodoo on me, I can feel when you want it
In another dimension, you're a blip in the matrix
A hat trick, never seen a real life, realize I fantasize
Hips sway under each breath, realize I fantasize
Hips sway under each breath, realize I fantasize

[Intro: Joba]
Angels watchin' over me, god damn
Hope the homies rest in peace, I can't
As I sink into concrete
I throw a prayer to the old me

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Twenty-five, they said twenty-five, no P.O. in sight, he just turned eighteen
Sun shinin' when they hit my cousin, it was like a month past MLK Day
Swear some nights I see him 'tween the shadows and the smoke, mane
God could watch me sin, he turned away from all my flaws, mane

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
.45, he got a .45 and I pray to God he don't bring it, man
Sunset, just another Texan, and that last semester ain't mean a thing
Everything that's evil make me feel alive
Know my niggas on the Southside got my back tonight

[Break: Kevin Abstract]
If you want it, I got it, you want it, I got it
Can you tell that I'm high? (Ooh, ooh)
If you want it, I got it, you want it, I got it, now (High, high)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Kevin Abstract and Jabari Manwa]
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
Talk down and get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the real still here, what you say? We don't care, yeah, ayy
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Talk down and get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
And the real still here, what you say? We don't care
[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Where my four-four? Where my po-po?
Po-po said can't have more, they say, "I got no drawers"
They say, "drum and you draw" They say, "drum and you lose"
They say, "drum and gun toss", I was very confused
I got friends that kill, I got friends that died
I got many woes, I got many wives
I got enemies, and I roll the dice, ayy-yeah, ayy-yeah-yeah
I got enemies, ayy-yeah, ayy-yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Kevin Abstract and Jabari Manwa]
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
Talk down and get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the real still here, what you say? We don't care, yeah, ayy
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Talk down and get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
And the real still here, what you say? We don't care

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
Bendin' round the corner, no sleep, I
Only feel good in my jeans, I
Never got some esteem, ah
I'ma go and get my cheese, high
I'ma just smoke with me, high
Never gon' set me free, ah
[Bridge: bearface]
It's you, love
It's true, love
(It's you, love) Hair down, wash it out
Fuck me up, oh my God (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(It's true, love) Low down, come around
When I see it, you gon' make me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(It's you, love) Hair down, wash it out
Fuck me up, oh my God (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Outro: bearface, Joba and Jabari Manwa]
It's you, love (It's true, what?)
It's true, love (It's true, what?)
It's you, it's you, love
It's true, love, it's true, love
It's you, love
It's true, true, true, love, true, love
It's true, love, it's true, love

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I just dropped out, I got my liberty
Acting like hot celebrity, actually I'm a rapper
Please, you a drop out?
No food in your mouth now
No weed in your mouth now
And no you in your mom's house
That don't sound so bad now
'Cause you ain't got no more bed now
And all them niggas you banked on
Is backing out like a ringtone, that's pop, lock and drop it
So I had to take that pot and ziploc it

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'm smoking blunts with Barack
Money inside of a sock
Stage diver holding my cock
You busy holding the block
And I've been refining my vision
You make the decision
We flexing in public, you love it
It's bullshit around me
I'm living above it
We too busy getting these buckets, nigga
Higher than the summit for the nuggets, nigga
Work on the canvas like Samo
I'm off the chain like I'm Django
Never been one for the labels
What do you bring to the table?
Nigga, stop speaking in fables
I'm a young misfit looking for the quick flip
Left hook take you out of this district
Watch a nigga's soul leave his existence
Hit a lick then I hop on my nimbus
Vicious

[Outro: Merlyn Wood]
Flip, flip mo nigga

[Video Intro: Romil Hemnani, Nick Lenzini, Zack Beitel and Robert Ontenient]
...and now you in Hollywood, baby
I know, isn't that crazy?
I saw Will Ferrell last night
Where? (where?)
And Woody Harrelson (where?)
Just in a restaurant, (what?)
I was walking down the street on La Brea
Will Ferrell and Woody Harrelson are-
They looked old. He had a shaved head
Well, yeah, he looks old. What movie was he in?
I forget

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Nineteen, I got my first boyfriend
Nineteen, I almost signed to Def Jam
I remember being younger watching Space Jam
Told my mama that I wanna be the bald man
Got older, goals changed, needed God's plan
Got older, got a chain, nigga, god-damn
Shit is gold and it hurt me when I walk man
And I ain't got it but I just got my advance
So I might cop it, yeah, nigga that's my energy
I might tell these niggas that they ain't no friends to me
'Cause I'm tired of these niggas sucking clout up
Like a motherfuckin' 'squito in the trough, bruh

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I got dirty money, minutes on my tracfone
I just bought a scale, now e'rywhere a traphouse
I got on TV, then I turned into an asshole
'Cause I ain't selling dope or running with them bad folk
I'm eating shrimp and lobster, sitting next to white folk
Now I'm in Trader Joes with Birkenstock and iPhone
My agent called said they want me in the movies now
They used to call me ugly, turned 'em into groupies now
Now I'm on Melrose, I'm ready for my closeup
They call me pretty, need to put me on the poster
I write my name, then I buy a Testarossa
I kill my haters then I leave 'em for the vultures

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
God-damn, man, I think I need a therapist
Feel like a goldfish in the bowl with
Twenty other goldfish with the bowl switched
Bowl-cut or the mullet 'til I shaved it
Barely made it but I'm still here on my kickstand
Did the same shit that duffed Whitney Houston
They was boostin' while I'm slurping from my sippy cup (sippy cup)
Need blue jeans, pulling out the pocket fluff (the pocket fluff)
Talking to myself like I am my best friend (hello, hello, hello)
When I walk, see the arrogance flushing (hello, hello, hello)
Make the front page like Paris in the sex tape (oh)
Barely late to my first date with my therapist

[Verse 4 (box set only): Joba]
Brrr! Call me, I'll be running in my, Asics
Gold plated belt buckle 'round my, sweat'ns
Tube socks, white tee, Polo underpants
I will never grow old, call me Peter Pan
Dial *67, when they need to listen
I move just like a phantom, I should have been a teacher
Handing out these lessons, my pupils ask no questions
They like to think they're special, I feed them graham crackers
Got my Timex in the mail, keep it in the case
They tapping lines every day, I cannot be traced
I don't believe in credit, my people call me different
I evade, then get paid, brr! Just a second

[Verse 4 (video only): Merlyn Wood]
Trusty press, wear the colors of the ocean
Skeetin' sad in my Supreme clothing
Hit my line if you ever need an OZ
Don't hit my line if you think you know the old me
Have gassed-ass plans in the e-class
And I'm still getting head on public transit
And I'm still really sad about my last chick
And I'm still 'bout to cry outta both heads

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow
Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow



[Verse - Jabari Manwa]
I made this song for you, what more I gotta prove?



Lyrics from Snippets

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Who let the dope boys out?

[Verse ?: Kevin Abstract]
I told them I got 'em
I told them I'd make it to Hollywood
All it took was a summer to fail
Cancel me as hard as you want
It ain't gone send me to hell
Truth prevails
This is real, missing-

[Verse ?: Danny Brown]
Yeah, rapping before the record begin
Niggas blow a lot of smoke like they breath in the wind
Ain't no pretend
Tell you how it is, how we go

[Verse ?: Kevin Abstract]
Tell my God that I'm praying to him now
Now, I made 2 thousand
[?] dropped me
And I do no pretention
Any direction, you gave me your blessing
Terrified, I, I, I, I, I

[Verse ?: Danny Brown]
Running from the [?] that I like wearing [?]
You niggas ain't [?] for the [?]
Your [?] ain't a part of the [?]



[Verse]
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back



[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I don't know why I wanna fuck with you
But all I know is that I really fuck with you
Really wish you didn't like to fuck with me
Wish you took that energy and trusted me
I get so exhausted when you fuss with me
'Cause all that time could be spent in love with me
I know I need it and you deserve it
You like to size me up to see if it's all worth it
I don't know where it is now, but I'm searchin'
I think you want what I don't ever want: be perfect
'Cause I ain't perfect, I just wanna be good to you
I would take my heart right out the hood for you
Wanna do the things I know I should for you
Standing by myself until I stood for you
If I knew this love, I woulda looked for you
But I'm glad you found me, I'm glad you found me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall

What you gonna do when you older?
What you gonna do when you grow?

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Split the diamond with us, fuck taking the bus
I want a whip to call my own and a home to call my own
All 14-15 of my niggas
To figure, ooh, that's a step-back
Ooh, my nigga, that's a step-back
If I had to choose, I would not choose you
If I had to stop, I would turn around and choose glue
If I had to hit the brakes, I'ma stop right here
If I had to choose, I'ma not choose you
If I had to turn around, I'ma turn into some glue
If I had to hit the brakes, I'ma stop right here, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall

[Breakdown: bearface]
You're all I love, washing off my hands
You're all I love, washing off my hands
You're all I love, washing off my hands

[Bridge: bearface]
Don't waste your mind
I'll be the one to say it all
To do what I am
To say what I am
Don't waste your mind
I'll be the one to settle
To do what I am
To say what I am

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and bearface]
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall (you're all I love)

[Outro: Joba]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and bearface, Both]
Gave, gave, gave, gave it to you (Yeah, yeah)
You're the type of dog that'll bark
That'll steal, that'll fuckin' chew (No)
If I gave, gave, gave, gave it to you (Yeah, yeah)
You're the type of dog that'll bark
That'll steal, that'll fuckin' chew (No)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
There's something I'm missin'
Surely not worth the trippin'
But it's not worth dismissin'
I gotta say what I feel
Niggas know that it's real
This that G-Unit feel
When them lame niggas trippin'
It's just my dogs in the field
And we shine over here
They lookin' blind over there
Our community's stuck
To show that they do not care
To show that these songs just moments you can move to
But truthfully I be having attacks
Tryin' to find out how I'mma eat next

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and bearface, Both]
Gave, gave, gave, gave it to you (Yeah, yeah)
You're the type of dog that'll bark
That'll steal, that'll fuckin' chew (No)
[Verse 2: Joba]
Showed up late without a cake to your birthday
You were quick to forgive me, uh
Your daddy says I'm nothin' but a bad boy
And off limits but he don't get it
Little does he know we take his audi out, uh
Little does he know that I am well endowed, uh
Never been in love with anyone 'till now so fuck it
You and me, that's going down
It's itchy, I'm itching
There's blades of grass imprinted on your back side
As well as mine
We're so impure, but yet so pure
I feel God's presence when we run and hide

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I don't know if I've been trippin'
I can't make a decision
Feel like I'm stuck in a mission
That brings me back to the stop
So is it even a finish?
When I work like a menace
To fill a void that I'm missin'
I couldn't tell it apart
I hate when people don't listen
And they just wait to reply
I see no heart in your eyes
You players real in disguise
I wash my feelings with time
Treat my feelings like tides
Even when I'm feeling shallow
There's still a lake in my mind
I think I'm drowning
I've been surrounded with false intentions
And now I'm clouded
I never doubted
And didn't give in
Have a garden
Was filled with snakes and
I started kicking in slow-mo
And into motion to rebuild
What's gotten broken (yeah)
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and bearface, Both]
Gave, gave, gave, gave it to you (Yeah, yeah)
You're the type of dog that'll bark
That'll steal, that'll fuckin' chew (No)
If I gave, gave, gave, gave it to you (Yeah, yeah)
You're the type of dog that'll bark
That'll steal, that'll fuckin' chew (Yeah)

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
Keep my shorty breathin'
'Cause she love me how like that fever hit my [?]
And I don't need none of that feelin', ooh

[Merlyn Wood harmonizing]

[Verse 5: Merlyn Wood]
I'm the fucker with the [?] style
Big ballin' won't see me at the [?]
Where my croissants? Where my diamond [?]?
I saw a poster said "I need my money tall as Yao"
Money like girls, it came around
Girls like money, y'all can bounce
Four seasons brunchin'
Stop face scrunchin', divin' in these dimes
Scrooge McDuckin', fine dime pumpin'
She grabbin' at my stomach, fuck it
I got a big tab but I run it
I see the atlas and I run it
I see a big tab and I run it
I learn the atlas and I run it
[Outro: Merlyn Wood]
What the point of being famous?
Gettin' sweat and spit on me
What the point of being famous?
Gettin' sweat and spit on me

[Verse 1: bearface]
Anyway, I ain't much for the cold
In your car, I felt lost
Cut her legs covered in scars
And erase my doubts for long

[Verse 2: bearface]
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind

[Verse 3: bearface]
Say you've lost your way and come to ask the way out soon
You always knew
Please don't stay far, I wish for more
With you



[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together
And you know you got your own space right here forever, baby
You know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And you know you got your own space right here forever, baby (And my own blessing)
Know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And you know you got your own space right here forever, babe (And my own blessing)
Know you got your own, know you got your own
I know you got your own, I know you got your own

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Ayy, stay sound when you not around
Mood is always better whenever you not around
Fuckin' up the weather and you fuckin' up my town
Fuckin' up a sweater and I'm fuckin' up a gown
Look at how I'm shinin' though
Look at how I'm smilin' though
Look at how I'm smilin'
Look at how I'm wildin', and I'm still broke, uh
You still think I'm a joke, uh, I still think I'm a joke, uh
I still think it ain't gon' work out
Nigga that shit is broke, broke, broke, broke

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Tell me, goddamn, what God made me for?
I don't even love no more
I don't even trust no more
I don't need to clutch no more
Some things outside of my control
I need some space, I need to grow
So I go, plague my soul
Say I won't
I never tried to let you go so deep, deep, deep, deep

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And you know you got your own space right here forever, baby (And my own blessing)
Know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And you know you got your own space right here forever, baby (And my own blessing)
You know you got your own, know you got your own
I know you got your own know you got your own

[Verse 3: bearface]
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind

[Interlude: Dom McLennon and bearface]
I don't wanna take this ride
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
Pull out your mind

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
What's worse is y'all just be stumblin' backwards
2001, the living room was filled with glass, it smelled like Backwoods
I can't even remember the last time like I felt like that was appropriate for you to be calling me names
I was leavin' you laughin'
I build from passion, study magic, got the patent, born a patient
Turn around like I'm Fantasia, tell them niggas that I'ma grace ya
I trade you for a Mercedes, baby, I wonder if that chain is real
Stop signs in disguises, man, I wonder if that paint if real
As the sun shine, my nigga Ashlan, man, yeah, he paint the steel
We ain't paint it still, stay still, find ways to stay real
They grill but they don't feel, I grow weaker and weaker
As I bleed through the speaker, Heaven is mine, God is me
I am one with my niggas
I am one with my niggas

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Matt Champion]
I can't deal with the time, I won't listen to you
If you count your check right, they won't give up on you
If you don't pull up on me right, I'ma give it to you
Middle finger to the sky, I'ma give it to you
I can't deal with the time, I won't listen to you
If you count your check right, they won't give up on you
If you don't pull up on me right, I'ma give it to you (Can you turn the beat up?)
Middle finger to the sky, I'ma give it to you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Yeah, caught an ambulance, I need a, shh, shh, clear (Woo)
I'm a little tilted like a fallen chandelier (Hello)
I just got my fan, I don't like bullshit, I can't hear (Nah)
Fresh, I done showed up feelin' fresh, ain't it clear?
Can you feel it, can you feel it like that? (I can)
Feelin' like a little feather ticklin' your back (Hoo-hoo)
Right down my face, what do you know? I'm throwin' slack (Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah)
She hold her finger like she flickin' cigarettes
We go low to the side like a jitsu
Get her in a circle, hit on it, no Alexa
Head, 'pon a muscle, 'pon a muscle, no flexin'
I do crazy dance, crazy dance, like I'm George, uh (Woo, woo, yeah)
Who is George? Glad you asked, George Jetson, correct, son
If they not movin', vote, we next 'em, less than (One)
Watch you [?] like you bought mansion (Ooh)
One-step, two-step, I'm no choreographer (Hmm, what?)
But I got you dancin', romancin'
She gon' move her body, watch her transform, uh, yeah
She gon' back it up, no need to mention nothin'
Had to take that lovin', lovin' out

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Deal with the time, I won't listen to you
If you count your check right, they won't give up on you
If you don't pull up on me right, I'ma give it to you
Middle finger to the sky, I'ma give it to you
I can't deal with the time, I won't listen to you
If you count your check right, they won't give up on you
If you don't pull up on me right, I'ma give it to you
Middle finger to the sky, I'ma give it to you

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Rock the boat like a one-eyed pirate
Rick James, I get glitter on my eyelids
2 A.M., 85 on the highway
Whole world get a little misguided
Where the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight
Trust no one that put you in the wrong light
High scream when I hit her with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang
Do my thing, no, I do not do speaking
Get my shot, point it out like Ruth, man
I'ma win a bitch and I got a mood swing
I'm the realest, bitch, now I got a mood swing
I got bipolar confidence
Wake up like "shit" then I feel like the shit
So I guess I'm the shit
Yeah, guess I'm the shit
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann and Merlyn Wood]
Grab life by the horns when I whip the Lambo
Black on red like I whip the sambo
Clip's so long it'll make you mambo
Watch you tango, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip her sides
And slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide
My electric eel do electric slide but-
I just wanna feel on the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
Make it slow clap like Rudy!
All on me, all on me, all on me
I just wanna feel on your booty
Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it
Gold chain swingin' and she like how I shoot it
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Merlyn Wood]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect (Damn)

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Damn, I'm frosty, blood diamond, I'm flossing
Navy camo, I'm drowning, but you don't see what it cost me
Turmoil like the Saudi's, hand-me-downs never fit me
Party never fit me, punani never fit me
Damn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', that's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn
Damn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', book learnin'
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
Swan dive down the 405
Land at the bottom of El Toro High
With the precision of a cut from a Zoro knife
The boy spit like he made out of 409
So that's clean, bitch
You can't play with my team, bitch
We rock pink now on Wednesdays
Green looks good with your envy
Mix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless
I'm like platinum and it's painless
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman
Hands up for all my sermons
My wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever
I feel like Ratatouille when I'm whipping that cheddar
You see, you better find your thickest of sweaters
'Cause this ice might fuck around and change your whole life
'Cause we about to take flight
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Outro: Joba and Jabari Manwa]
Keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)
I keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)
Keep a gold chain (I said I keep a, gold chain)
Keep a gold chain (I keep a gold chain)
Keep a gold chain (I said I keep a, I said I keep a)
(I keep a gold chain, a gold chain)
Keep a gold chain
(I said I keep a, I keep a)
Keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

I'ma win a bitch and I got a mood swing

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
I go where the money go
Go where the money go (Bang, bang, cash)
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
I go where the money go
Go-go where the money go
Bang, bang, cash
Give me the bag
Why you see me laugh
Pass me plastic bag
Bang, bang, cash
Give me the bag
Why you see me laugh
Pass me plastic bag

[Verse: Matt Champion]
You somebody like nobody look back though
They just jealous off the Xannys...

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
These niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?
Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish
Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard
I can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off
Seen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot
I give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off
That make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup
My niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust
That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit
And he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?
He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit
That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up
Ain't that boy from Texas? He ain't acting like a soldier
Knew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward
And I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

[Post-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Call me King of the Niggas, I need a crown made of thorns
God said, "Let there be light" on the day I was born
Step off the ship with the slaves, then I go hit the stage
I just left in a whip, all I need is a chain
I don't trust no niggas and I don't trust no bitch
'Cause people talk too much, I bought a black fo'-fifth
And a brand new clip, that's my new best friend
'Cause I'm a brand new nigga, in a brand new crib
I ain't sellin' no more, but got my hand in the zip
Whitey gave me the check, I ain't ask for the fame
I used to deal with the grams 'til they put the cam on my face
Now I'm evading the law, I'm on a high-speed chase
I'm in a big-ass truck, I tell 'em, "Get out the way"
I gotta couple of warrants, so I'm leaving my state
Now I'm in Cali today, with the sun on my face
I got a bag of the gas, and a blunt I can face

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
How I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone
You think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own
Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone
They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones
I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras
I put my heart in a locker, they love me when I'm a martyr
They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that
You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque
I need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga
In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger
I could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em
"We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter"
That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Fuck, put ya ante up, riding in the limousine
I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy
Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now
Up like a money shot, swerve into the sunset
Me and all my boys jet, swerving like a doughnut
Off, off, off, off, swerving like a doughnut

[Outro: Kevin Abstract and JOBA]
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what? Y-yo

Chorus: Kevin Abstract
Know it's hard to let go of me now
(?)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Verse 1: Kevin Abstract
(?)
And my niggas still don't care about it

Verse: Dom McLennon
Probably thought that I forgot about it yeah
Probably thought that I was (?)

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I got pipe dreams of crack rocks and stripper poles
Of fucking centerfolds
So I got secrets only me and all my niggas know
Of kicking in the doors
I'll send a bitch to get ya, so don't play fucking stupid
I know you got the product
'Cause I could smell the money, I could taste the weed
Give me somethin' or a body, only way I'll leave
I love to watch 'em squirm, I love when bitches bleed
If she's sucking on the barrel, you can't hear her scream
So kiss the fucking carpet, this aggravated larson
And then I'm out the door, it's monsters in your home
Black gloves, mask on, muzzle plated chrome

[Chorus: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That's the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Shotta, shotta
Who be that, the number one shotta?
Put a missile on you when I'm on your blocka
It no be thing, no be issue when I'm off it, off it, I'm off it
I got the magazine for the pistol
For any politician talkin' shit, givin' issue
Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, we go another pistol
Huh, fuck-another cracker
Cop comin' on my block for the answers
Huh, I no got time for your question
Huh, this pon' mi mommy and mi bredren

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I'm tryna change, but it'll never work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete feels the hardest every time I seem to touch it
Started thinking I ain't meant for life; but that's too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I'm drowning
In the creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates, I'm trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that's on the fuckin' menu
I'm dancing with myself, setting fire to the venue, motherfucker
[Chorus: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That's the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

[Bridge: Joba]
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should've shot him
Pray to God about him, man, I hit the Lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder, shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches, so now it's off to millions
I been fucking sinning, hit the forehead
Chest, left, right, I'm grinning, asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings, for all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain, 'fore all y'all changed on me
Rearranged on me, suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended, and this ain't clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me, sippin' Cris' on ya
Bet ya life on it, I came to fight for it
[Outro: Matt Champion]
Came in, raided all y'all pockets
And your bitch came in and rubbed up on me
I'm burning rubber, I pulled up on ya[Hook: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That's the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Shotta, shotta

Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, we go another pistol
Huh, fuck, another cop car
Cop coming on my block for the answers
Bitch, I only got a few questions
Fuck it, pon' mi mommy and mi bredren

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I'm tryna change, that shit don't ever work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete always hurts too
Started thinking I ain't meant for life; but that's too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I'm drowning
In shit's creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates, I'm trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that's on the fuckin' menu
I'm dancing by myself, setting fire to the venue, motherfucker

[Bridge: Joba]
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!

My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should've shot him
Pray to God about him, man, I hit the lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder, shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches, so now it's off to millions
I been fucking sinning, hit the forehead
Chest, left, right, I'm grinning, asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings, for all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain, 'fore all y'all changed on me
Rearranged on me, suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended, and this ain't clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me, sippin' Cris' on ya
Bet ya life on it, I came to fight for it
Came in, raided all y'all pockets
And your bitch came in and rubbed up on me
I'm burning rubber, I pulled up on you[Intro]
Immersed myself in discontent
Hopin' you can only repent these things
It smells like ginger

[Verse]
What you mean, I ain't green like Timothy?
Dead leaves in the breeze, sweep your chimneys
See the boy try me, now the boy deceased
They put the blame on me, but hey, it wasn't me (Boom, boom, boom)
Like God can't judge me, but only God can see
I ain't bein' judged, no one judgin' me
I walk on water, pain and torture what I bring to these
And there's a war in my head, just like the Middle East
And I'm the flurry, vision blurry, see soliloquies
I didn't get the memo, didn't CC me
Only CC me when I'm doin' burglaries
And if it weren't on TV you wouldn't have ever seen

[Chorus]
Fuck God, I'm a dog backwards
Backwards, I don't smoke Backwoods
What you sayin'? Why you prayin' for forgiveness?
When you wanna get money, get them riches
Like what you sayin'? Why you prayin' for forgiveness?
Whole lot of shit and some bitches, like
(Mmm, mmm, ha, yeah, fuck it, yeah, yeah)
[Outro]
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law

[Verse 1: Rodney Tenor]
I'm sorta back, I'll quarterback yo' side chick
Hut, hut, one hike bitch, don't hide her, I'll find it
Hit it once then rewind it, hit it twice, then get blinded
We get blunted, I don't trust em, and I don't act like I love em
I finally finish, she finally famous
I finally did it, I found me a stranger
I took her to dinner, and then I got in it
I told her she ain't shit and then she replaced me
With some other nigga, she told me she hate how I roll
Better than dragging this chick on the road (road, road, road)
Better than taking this chick to my show
Get straight, keep pace or keep space from my face
No taste, a lot of ladies is sixth place
Type to get misplaced, drunk, and throwed
Shawty was getting old, and she ain't know that I was cold
And she always wanted more
Click, clack, boom, bap, goes the beat
When I can't keep shawty on her feet

[Bridge: Joba]
No more tears
No more fears
No more years
To waste on thoughts unclear

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
You can't wait for love, that shit don't last forever
I can't wait for you, that shit don't last forever
I know you well, know you better than yourself
Know your ins and outs and curves
You swerving straight into your house
You know my name (know my name)
Say my name, touch yourself
We got issues (we got issues)
Know your frame, know your game
We got issues (we got issues)
Know I'm lame, know you same
We got issues (still got issues)
Keep it strange, no to blame
Fuck you and your shit
Swear you burn like matches' tip
Swear you fucked like half these kids
How'd I love on such a bitch?
Shoulda fucked up on your cousin
She look good even with black eyes
Next time that you say you love me
Baby I'll just ask why, yeah

[Bridge: Joba]
No more tears
No more fears
No more years
To waste on thoughts unclear

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
She put her whole spirit in it

She run around and keep her whole spirit in it
She put her whole spirit in it
She turn around, she let the whole squad hit it
She let the whole squad hit it
She turn around, she let the whole squad hit it
She let the whole squad hit it
Ain't that a bitch? Face down that bitch
She turn around, disrespect that bitch
Ain't that a bitch? Face down that bitch
She turn around, disrespect that bitch

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract and Merlyn Wood]
Critique signs, critique harsh
Have a barber at my funeral, make sure my niggas cut right
Lineups like they fresh for a flight, my whole life been glamorized
Some dramatized, my sexuality, but baby make it sanitized
Just make the motherfuckers feel it, 'cause it's hammer-sized
Deep in the Atlanta night, we all felt them bama skies
Move my niggas to Montana, only keep a landline
Holler if you feel me, this feel like the night that 'Pac died
Finna hire more niggas that look like us
And when the ones around your city turn against you, who do I trust?
I seen them lined up and loaded, some of the boys even look like us
Man, I love my cup, double up
And I fuck my thugs, that's love (Merlyn)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control my life, life, life, life
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control ya life, life, life, life

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Merlyn
Fishing in Nazareth, tryna catch a bad bitch
Burnin' big bushes but they never burn to ashes
Catch 'em with the bass line, bring 'em to my palace
Like how my mind sharper than a Samurai tick
One hit of this make the sky really different
Ran for forty nights but I sting like Cassius
Inside her thighs, that's aurora borealis
That's my favorite memory, missionary secondary
Sorry, baby, baby, know you lookin' for a hubby
But the blue faces only thing I wasn't trustin'
Yes, Lord, give it to me, yes, Lord, give it to me
God made melody so I could make money, money

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control my life, life, life, life
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control ya life, life, life, life



[Verse 1: bearface]
Oh, try to keep your cool
You got a grip, baby
But you just can't seem to fall
You know what we are
Took for granted, fell, we catch ourselves
Don't worry, baby girl
There's no one in the world
But when you say I got a girl
Say it and I know it's killin' you, yeah
When I say you make my knees so weak
Then you know I'm missin' you

[Chorus: bearface]
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl

[Bridge: bearface]
Send me to California
I'm tryna get so lost
Not turnin' up to a 9 to 5
Just wanna know why

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
No plate on a white Lexus
I blacked out on a random cliff
Summer nights, I saw things change
And you still not right to my tick
Pleasure, something
Deep inside my chest
Long nights, long drives
Change across my face
Cowboy, ride it
That's my wild west
Come on babe, you can put it on us
Come on babe, you can put it on me

[Chorus: bearface]
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I need to step out with no frustration
I need a permanent getaway vacation
They got a permanent hit list, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
50 did it right

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
I could've been homeless
I thought I moved to orphanage for the summer
I could've been homeless
Before I had a goal, I had a course

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
My people still dry snitchin' whenever they touch the mic
That's what happens when a therapist isn't somewhere in sight
Take flight, never leaned to the left, or the right
'Cause they turn the other cheek when our niggas start to die
When our women start to die, when our children start to die
I don't feel their empathy, we been displaced too many times
Every summer in the city start to feel like Columbine
'Cause you gotta get yours, and I gotta get mine
One time for the paragons of the paradigm
When you underground, they gon' only try to undermine
Use the track as a gymnasium to get into the stadium
You couldn't match my alien, I'm glowing like uranium

[Intro]
One, two, three, and, and

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't care if you there when I leave
When I'm gone, tag along, we both weak
I don't care, don't take my money
Take my money, the hood still love me
I don't care if you there (I don't care if you there) when I leave
When I'm gone, tag along (When I'm gone, tag along), we both weak
I don't care (I don't care if you-), don't take my money (I don't care)
Take my money (I don't care if you-), the hood still love me (I don't care)
(I don't care if you there)[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now,  that's enough, that's enough

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Do you see what you contribute to my consciousness?
Voices feelin' so ominous
I can't place a pen for you, they mark it out as anonymous
I would shift the whole continent
If it helped you 'round with some confidence
Thinkin' bout all the consequence
Gotta try to break what's monotonous

[Verse 2: Joba]
How could I be better?
I paid the price in full, just to clear the record
Rewound just to fast forward
On the eight-track I stole from my grandmama

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Catastrophic, where the stoppin'?
Man, I wish I had a rocket
Wish I ain't feel microscopic
Wish my thoughts was telepathic
But instead I'm always babbling
Love rappin' like it's my girlfriend
Every tour is like a catfish
Just kidding, I love you assholes
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough

[Verse 4: Joba]
It's hard to air out in deep water
You keep calling, I ignore it
Cleared my conscience in absurd ways
I do the things you hate, I'm changing every day

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know where the party at)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know when we leavin', boo)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know where the party at)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know when we leavin', boo)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)

Out on the deck like I'm wildin' for respect
It's a three-peat, see-see
Bitch, you in the D-League
Boy, you fucked up
Can't come around here, this shit is gated
We made it, happy belated, I see the rage hit

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
It's better if I try not to talk about the shit that's always on my mind
Money on my mind (That's right), couple hunnids at a time
Try to fuck me blind, duckin' down, hear me whine (Ooh)
We outside now (That's right), milk carton in the back
We don't like to fuck around with them niggas in the back
Pullin' triggers in the 'Lac (That's right)
May the praise stay bad
Ayy, Dad, Hercules want his fuckin' waves back, stay strapped (Ooh, I like that, that's right)
Dancin' like a bad bitch, love on top my mattress
Hope the good Lord catch this, I ain't tellin' backwards
Lie just like an actor, Hollywood is batshit
Mama in the South still, gold all in my mouth still
Rappin' 'bout dick still, and I lease a house still
Move my nigga out, still need my nephew out here
God gave me a good deal
Miss my little niggas down low like a big wheel
Bitch, I wanna hit still
This shit for my partna 'nem, Devil keep on robbin' them
Express and feel myself, like I'm fuckin' Dennis Rodman (That's right)
[Verse 2:  Merlyn Wood]
Like I'm Dennis Rodman
Diamond dentures for my partna 'dem (That's right)
Golden rubbers from my pocket, friend
Ain't no answer, that's my partna 'dem (That's right)
She so bad, I let her touch my butt (Yeah)
Merlyn, what the fuck?

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Line 'em-line 'em-line 'em up, you know that I'm shootin' (That's right)
It ain't no one business who or what we doin' (That's right)
Hit this gas, they break the glass and keep it movin'
To you basic bitches I know I'm a nuisance

[Verse 4: Joba]
Sugar, yeah, gimme some
Gimme dome, I'ma smoke some
Y'all ain't want the smoke, been smokin'
Garden gnome shrooms, y'all, who is y'all?
This what it mean to ball?
Okay, Chateau Marmont, Shangri-La
Valet park it, drive a shit whip
But I ain't broke, bitch
Write my own shit, hit my own switch
Watched the clock tick, never ran and hid
Tell it like it is
Dead on the nail, call me hammerhead
Texas 'til I'm dead
BBQ and cornbread, like 'em corn fed
Here we go again, hit 'em one mo' 'gain
Screwed up from The Woodlands
Number six, been through Hell, think I'm Heaven-sent
Ask the preacher man, said I need Jesus, like I ain't know
Guess I found him, I am blessed, man
Rake in dividends, let the money stack, see you copycats
I ain't trippin', but copy that
It's a wrap, keep my distance
Where's Waldo, but we winnin'
Me and my dogs ain't finished (That's right)
The real know, what's a billfold?
You can't fold, I stay grinnin'
No peekin'
[Bridge: Henock Sileshi]
Go ahead and try harder
You ain't gotta ask to put up with nobody
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Get on your damn knees
And pray sometimes with your muhfuckin' ass
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Get yo' muhfuckin' ass on out there
That's all you gon' be, a muhfucker
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves

[Outro: Matt Champion]

Uh-huh
This is that Technical Difficulties
We run streets, every day, all day
Live in Club Kaufman
Pardon the, uh, Technical Difficulties

[Verse: Matt Champion, Joba and Kevin Abstract]
Call me Cupid 'cause my birthday be up on V-Day
I don't like talkin' much 'cause I don't like saying "Like, like"
Like I got a knife to my throat or the wind blowin' a tightrope
Or someone repeatin' what I'm saying, like, I know (I know)
If I was never wrong I would've been right, right?
Wrong, bitch, if I was right, I wouldn't be here with this long face
Plenty of red flags, I'da skipped and thrown away
Might have made me better or I'm just stupid, who's to say?
Are there some angels in my area?
If I don't like the function, can I post up on the barrier?
Ass so fat, I put my cup up on the derriere
Fashion shit is shakin', I'll be honest, I am very scared
And if I ever die young (Die young)
Have Larry David do the eulogy (Eulogy)
And film it on one of those little camcorders where you can barely see
And hire someone to throw up all of my jewelry

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Kevin Abstract and Matt Champion]
I feel like ain't nobody around me got my back
I feel like there's some niggas gon' turn on me, ayy, ayy, ayy
I do this shit on my own and that's a fact
Go ahead and go where you belong on me, ayy, ayy
I feel like ain't nobody around me got my back
I feel like there's some niggas gon' turn on me, ayy, ayy, ayy
I do this shit on my own and that's a fact
Go ahead and go where you belong on me, ayy, ayy

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Six feet deep, I ain't never gon' die
(Ladies and gentlemen, la-ladies and gentlemen)
Four, eight, eight in the passenger side
(Ladies and gentlemen, la-ladies and gentlemen)
Tyin' up my shoes, I'm just tryna get by

Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm just tryna get by

Hallelujah, holy lion, word to Judas
How I'm supposed to, (Hey) trust what you say is the truest? (Right)
Haile Selassie, (Uh) insha'Allah if I gotta (Woo)
Spin my words around as if you wanted a mandala for Nirvana
Singin' a sonata towards our karma
Did a rain dance, bringin' commas from Tacoma to Oaxaca
I got spirits in my heart that make my mind move like it's water
Flow into the moment and avoid the melodrama
Gotta breathe for a second
Can't believe anybody still testin'
My whole team is a force to be reckoned with
Operatin' like specialists
One to the two to the who are you?
Sendin' out projections with prejudice
My attention to detail is in scale with classic impressionists
So the lesson is that prerequisites are irrelevant to my standards (Right)
It's a deficit in your settlement, you better learn to mind all your manners (Right)
My whole troop been goin' bananas
Try and step inside of our jungle (Right)
You can try to take all your chances
We won't help your ass if you stumble, nigga (Right)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out

Watch your back, (Ayy) don't leave your door cracked (Yeah, yeah)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse (Yeah)
Watch your back, (What?) don't leave your door cracked (Woohoo)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse (If you, if you, if you, if you, hey)

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
If you want a feature, we can figure it out
Want a color for your album? We can figure it out
How you not invite the boys who colored your rollout
Then you copy-paste hard work from the BH house?
I always got somethin' to say when you take food from my mouth
I begged my mommy for money until the day it ran out
They say, "We helped you when and when, now you should figure it out"
Figure it out

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out

Waste your breath, watch the tone though
Take you to the dojo
Roll up my doja, sticky fingers
At the door, bruh, Jehovah, you ho bitch
Witness sadistic shit, will come again
Next time I take my belt off, spank you
Bad kid, bad seed, not me, got beef
I leave body, blackout from rage
Childproof my pockets, don't need the options
Romanticizing what I do if I ain't stop me
Can be off me, tread lightly

Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I'm tired of making a fool out of me and you
Is there anything that I can do that'll save us, baby?
Is there anybody lovin' lies and robbin' shotties
45's and still alive, and no drunk drivin'
That's how they killed my brother
(Walking with Jesus)
You know, you know better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better, better, better, bet on it
Better bet on it, better bet on it, hey
(Walking with Jesus)
You know, you know better
Better, better, better, bet, bet on it
Bet on it, ayy, ayy, yeah
Ayy, yeah
I wanna sing, I wanna
I wanna sing, ooh
(Just tell 'em, tell 'em that)
Ah, cool
(Walking with Jesus Christ)
(Walking with the Lord)

You fired, you fired (For Joie!)
Shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot
Shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot
Shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot
Shawty shot me out the atmosphere, well this one year
I was flyin' high in the pimp plane atmosphere
Shy, shawty, shawty shy, shawty shy, shawty, shawty shy
Shawty, shawty shy, shawty shy, shawty, shawty shy
Shawty, shawty shot me out the sky, well this one year
I was flyin' high in the pimp plane atmosphere

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood and Kevin Abstract]
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora, come home, you been searchin' too long

[Verse 1: Rodney Tenor]
Shit, high-waist jeans with a kid
Shorty always flexin' on the 'gram
Tight, tight jeans with a rack make me go on a rant
Shawty, but your attitude rank
Drunk at the club with your girls only here for the drinks
Untouchable data, unmeasurable playa'
God, the moderator, I ain't sayin', I'm hittin'
I was just wondering if I could call at your number
If I was ever in trouble, if I could take you home
I ain't a doper, you ain't a smoker
I'm hopin' to get to know you
I'm wonderin' if I could get you gone, girl
I was lookin' for ride-or-dies
And there you came through
With your fine disguise, yeah, yeah
I ain't fuckin' around no more
Don't hear me, all she hear was sha-la-la-la
[Chorus: Merlyn Wood and Kevin Abstract]
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora, come home, you been searchin' too long

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
We all gonna die one day, man ain't that crazy? (that cray)
She said thats an odd way convince me to be your lady
That be why you bae, but you is not my baby
I met these three black girls: Ocian, Jurnee, and Mercedes
One's a queen, one's narcoleptic, and one is crazy
Pickin' one lover's just like pickin' one daisy
I need at least a dozen in my DMs on the daily
Why get your nose stuck in one when you can sniff the bouquet?

[Outro: Joba]
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la-ah

[Intro: Kevin Abstract and JOBA]
I know I always do it better when I see ya
I know I always gotta leave in such a hurry
Left me in the sink with my face all dirty
Parked outside of Sonic and my niggas got
Got too much shit to think about (I know I'm broken)
Got too much shit to think about (Yeah nigga, I know)

[Chorus: JOBA]
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Tell me who I am, I don't know
I'm doing dumb shit I did before (Nothing in my head ever makes sense)
Running from all I know
Hate it when my mama calls (Nothing in my head ever makes sense)

[Post-Chorus: JOBA]
Her baby boy has lost his soul
The life he lives sure takes a toll
It's all in my head
It's all in my head

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
They tryna publicate these watered down soliloquies
And wonder why I don't reciprocate the energy
I'm movin' vividly, I ain't for the civility
They check my brilliancy, uh
What's next when you shake up the world within a trilogy?
Become a better human? Check your masculinity?
The Brutuses around you start to move suspiciously
Too many voices around me, I don't need a polyphony
This ain't for dignity
This ain't for principle
It's just the truth that there's nobody that's invincible

[Chorus: JOBA]
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Tell me who I am, I don't know
I'm doing dumb shit I did before (Nothing in my head ever makes sense)
Running from all I know (Nothing in my head ever makes sense)
Hate it when my mama call

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
What's heaven look like?
What our brothers look like?
What he look like when he realize that we not alike?
I was younger, I would pretend my toothbrush was a mic
Late to school 'cause I was singing in the mirror like I just got signed
(Your truth gon' set me free)
(Your truth gon' set me free)
I'm hangin' on by a rope, come on Angelo
Come on, let me grow, let me love, let me glow
Had the TV show, shit let me know
Can't trust people
Cried thinkin' about how I can't help people that put me first
Man, the pride shit hurt 'cause I know ma hurt
Do I help her or watch her hurt?
Bein' petty by the time she ain't put me first
It could be made up (Ah, ah)
It's probably made up (Ah)

[Instrumental Outro]

[Interlude: Jabari Manwa]
"My first experience with water could've been 2001. Father took me to the beach, taught me how to swim and... it didn't work. Beautiful memory though."[Interlude: Jeff Goldblum, Interviewer]
"-Stem from show business, uh, generally... I mean I have, I started out with many, many desires as far as, uh, as far as this business goes and uh... I so surpassed all of them that I, that I, that it-it's, uh, it's not as meaningful to me anymore. I really love the work itself. I've examined myself on several occasions: Why am I really doing this? Am I doing this because I want to be famous? And I think there was an element of that when I started out; I wanted to be a rainmaker."
"Well, we should talk about that one for a quick second. What does that mean?"
"It means, uh, I think I wasn't necessarily seeing as much or as, uh, apparently as I wanted to be when I was a kid. I had, I had a job, uh... at least in my own mind and that was to make my mother feel better. She was, uh, kind of, uh... very ill in many ways. And that, so it was to make her feel better. And I think ultimately I imitated my father. He was a very funny guy. But also, I felt some need-I, I don't if maybe they created it or I created it-but I had a need to make them feel like their life was worthwhile, that they did something special by the very fact that they bought me into the world. From a very young age, I wanted to convince them that I was a miracle... and then I wanted to convince the world that I was a miracle."[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Hi, I live a wonderful life
Should've died twice, wonder who on my side
Life always better keepin' two on the side
Need no music when my niggas arrive
We be in Van Nuys, black van with some white guys
Keep your hand out, waiting for the appropriate time
To ask a question like
"Could you perform at my best friend's birthday party?
With your friends and go crazy, just bring the shotty
Bring the loud one with the blonde hair."
Making out with Zayn in a lawn chair
They kicked me out but I belong here
Hear these songs nigga, see this long hair, see these videos
Direct these hoes with no budgets though
How the fuck did I land a fucking TV show?
Met all my friends through Kanye West and I ain't met him yet
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Just shaved down to the baby face
Clothes on me, guess it's Holiday
Fried, no sides at the restaurant
My sleep schedule like the power here, it's never on
Feeling like the past year a whole escapade (uh-oh)
Four cars, need a motherfucking Escalade
Pack it up like a clown car (honk, honk)
Bet you know my name from here to Hong Kong, bet I get along
Make some commas, karma, watch 'em sing along
Ayy, err, err, butter knife like dancing on a knuckle
In the thunder car, rocked up in the Lumma
Incidental, I be better by the summer
I be better by the winter, I be hoppin' in the rental
Maybe Tesla for all my missus sitting in the Volvo
Damn, shoot 'em down like, hmmm, sorry, do it all here

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I'm moonwalking on the sun hot
I used to live where the guns popped
Made some records then we moved out
Turned rap into the new pop
Bandana, I'm the new Pac
I been blowing up, I can't stop
They need my niggas in the White House
I do business with the white folks
Bring that money back to black folks
Flip it, stimulate the cash flow
Economic, but I speak ebonics
L.A. turned me to an asshole
I been shopping down on Melrose
Still a nigga but I'm livin' different
I been looking at the bigger picture
So I don't hear 'em when they talking to me

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
I just want a friend to fall in love with
Maybe someone I can binge drugs with
Living like a prince but I'm dove-less
Playin' my emotions, you a dumb bitch
Everybody talking on some gun shit
They don't even know where to bust it
Cry nigga, gotta fuckin' kick back
Gotta leave those soft niggas at the kickback
Splittin' all my problems like a Kit-Kat
I finessed the night that we slipped up
I could let you know where I'm next at
Tell my baby girl where the brakes at
You know I got number one pick stats
Catch me on the field, it's a mismatch
More like an eclipse, she couldn't miss that
Putting my ideas where my chips at
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

La-di-da-di-da-di-da (La-di-da, la-di-da)
Do-walla, do-walla-walla, do-walla
La-di-da-di-da-di-da (La-di-da, la-di-da)
Do-walla, do-walla-walla, do-walla
La-di-da-di-da-di-da (La-di-da, la-di-da)
Do-walla, do-walla-walla, do-walla[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
I felt awesome when you walked in
You caught me doin' something
That I should've never been caught with
I played the forest, my far trip
I tripped and I fell, still think I'm living in Austin
Remember when I was trippin' off some wack shit
When I thought the automatic had an answer?
When I was jammin' out Beyonce like Sampha
And you broke up with me 'cause I'm a Cancer?
Our relationship was toxic, cancer
I fell in love with a dancer in Atlanta
I'm lying, I ain't a Drake-ass nigga
I'm more like Troye Sivan
With a whole lotta mela-nahn
Sendin' bombs to your lawn
Grew up on Rockafella, so I'ma get a chain
And sing every song in the vain of your name
And this'll...

[Outro: bearface]
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you, I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, ooh
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you, I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, ooh

[Interlude: Jaden Walker, Kevin Abstract]
"First experience with, like, a body of water would probably be when I went to the lake with my dad, he rode the Jeff Gordon jet ski that he got on eBay.
"What color was it?"
It was rainbow. Like, it looked just like Jeff Gordon's car. And it said "24." He met Jeff Gordon when he bought it. He loved it, so I rode on it with him in the Lake Havasu probably? Maybe it was in Arizona or something, I don't know, I don't remember. Um..."
"What'd the sky look like, was it bright? Was it sun out?"
"Yeah, the sun was definitely out."

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
When I imagine myself on acid
I taste the Backwoods and find those 'til I piss off
Even dance and pounce around
My silent thoughts who had the crown
Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't let life pass yourself
When I imagine myself on acid
I taste the Backwoods and find those 'til I piss off
Even dance and pounce around
My silent thoughts who had the crown
Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't let life pass yourself

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I could've got a job at McDonald's, but I like curly fries
That's a metaphor for my life, and I like taller guys
Could've got a deal if I wanted, but I like owning shit
And I like making shit, and I like selling it

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Could've peaked when I was in high school, but I had bigger plans
Could've took the time out to find you, but you ain't understand
You don't gotta leave for them to define you, 'cause what could you demand?
When everybody out to define you without a circumstance

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Anybody got Harry Styles' phone number?
Okay, I called him and they said I got the wrong number
I was tryna be Pac when I was younger, dreaming of better days
I don't see my mom no more, remind me of bad weather days
[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
If you got a problem with me, try some other guy
I let you know I'm a dog, I eat the cat alive
But really, though, I'm alone, 'cause I don't stick around
And yes, I know it's my fault, so put your finger down

[Verse 5: Matt Champion]
I would keep this shit pent up if it weren't for my mom
If it weren't for Dijon
Yeah, I don't like to lie, guess it sounds out the month
Should've opened up my mouth more, show 'em what my fist for
Let 'em get a fistful, caught up in the lust, man
Bred from the legs of straight killers on best end
Black eyes, bloody sheets, damn, where yo' feet stand?
We should get a new plan, maybe some more fans

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
Keep it wild for me, wild, wild, homie
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
Keep it wild for me, wild, wild, homie
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again

[Verse 6: Joba]
I'm a shithead son, and I'm bad at growing up
I'm a shithead son, and I'm bad at growing up
My life ain't been the same since my dog died
Since my girl left
I quit drinking and drugging and still can't get ahead
Been at a loss for words
It seems I'm destined to fall apart when I'm depressed
It's all a test, scream at God from my bedside
I glue my hands together, life's got me hog-tied
There's no applause in the game of life, I just bought a car
And a new house, here's the cost to prove it
I spin a little wheel when I'm feelin' moody
And that's like all the time, try not to mind the clock
Because my heart is ticking, I smoke a pack a day and
I wish I didn't, having some trouble quittin'
I have a couple vices, we had that show on Viceland
I was hardly in it; most the time, I'm hidden
Anxious, impatient and always wanting something different
I hate the way I'm feeling, I'm sick of chasing feelings
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again[Intro]
Take it all, or leave it
I feel you

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
When there's a rough patch, don't eye for the parachute
They goin' AWOL the second that the light goes on
This a treat, ain't it, soon as she hit the powder room
I pull it back and check my rose, and yeah, I'm 'bout to bloom
It's that '90 raised from hell shit, parlay like when the lane switch
Combat how you feel, strobe light, I hit the killswitch
Neck twist like Exorcist, I'ma see you 'round
'Cause tonight's the night I'm losin' all I'm doin', I'm about this

[Chorus: Joba]
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, suitcase
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank

[Verse 2: Joba]
'Til the casket drops, I will play God
Fuck the world, let's start a riot
Got too much, too quick
God damn, I'm feelin' sick, bitch, call the doctor
Don't act like I ain't been dead to ya
Don't act like I ain't deserve this shit
Couldn't last a day inside my head
That's why I did the drugs I did
Got issues with these motherfuckers
Looking down from they pedestals
From that petty view, on that petty shit
Pray for peace with a knife in my hand
Speak my piece like a gun to my head
Come equipped just to blast this shit
Misunderstood since birth
Fuck what you think, and fuck what you heard
I feel betrayed, you can keep the praise
And all of the fuck shit need to get away
Still ain't got the fright to the fickle-minded people
I thought I knew better, wish I knew better
Should have known better, wish that I was better
At dealing with the fame and you fake motherfuckers
Guess I'm too real
[Break: Lavaman]
Excuse we?
Let we pass, rum is the gas
We ain't play nice, little guy
Doh blame meh, blame di rum, no t-

[Bridge 1: Merlyn Wood, Lavaman]
I be in my bag (Excuse we?)
Goin' in (Let we pass, rum is the gas)
Guess who isn't built for this, man?
Me and my thugs built for this, man (Yeah)
We goin' for the gifts and the grams (Doh-)
I be in my bag (Excuse we?)
Goin' in (Let we pass, rum is the gas)
Smokin' all the grams in this bag
Man, you isn't built for this, man (Yeah)
Run it like the gingerbread man (Doh-)

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Fuck that shit, stay hydrated nigga
I'ma lick that bitch, go home, kiss my momma, wassup?
Wassup?
Black power fist hangin' from my black 'fro
Yo, she saw me in that cereal, she want to lick a Oreo, damn
Break the dam when I spit the flow
I'm on the lamb like the fuckin' wool
Hoppin' out the van, I'm at Abbey Road
Fans with cameras in the bathroom, man, that's difficult
I just wanna smoke a Backwoods by my lonely self
Chill, watch numbers go up, book off the shelf
I found myself and put my face on a missing shirt
I dropped out with no promise that this shit would
(That this shit would work, work, work
Work, work, work, work)
(Work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work)
[Bridge 2: bearface]
With the dogs in my ride, know the doors suicide
Paranoid, do or die, you should know we never lie
With the dogs in my ride, know the doors suicide
Paranoid, do or die, you should know we never lie
Pull up with the racks to your shop
Cop a medallion or three, I'm the don
Zim, zim, zim out the Bim', get shot
One mill, two mill, three, that's a lot, damn

[Chorus: Joba]
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, bank, bank, suitcase
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, bank, bank

[Video Intro: Robert Ontenient]
Me Ilamo Roberto y estamos buscando a Jaden Smith

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay; why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund a business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type?
Why don't you take that mask off?
That's the thought I had last night
"Why you always rap about bein' gay?"
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called "faggot" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off, and
And my legs off, and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

[Bridge: Ameer Vann]
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup 'til I hear crackin' sounds
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup 'til I hear crackin' sounds
Break, break, break the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup 'til I hear crack, crack, crack
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup 'til I hear crack

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
(Go 'head, now)
I got my hand on an ounce, and I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
(Go 'head, now)
I took an eighth of them shrooms and now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
(Go 'head, now)
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Feelin' like a goner, put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer
Hot bars in the summer (Merlyn, Merlyn!)
If I had the option, I would do it all again
If I had the option, I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins (Again)
When I cut the veil, I do not think 'bout diplomas
Love is knowin' that you didn't do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie, and my uncles
For guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on Atlanta

[Bridge: Matt Champion and Joba]
Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling, wondering, "why?"
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hate-fueled love, we don't fake it, no givin', just takin'

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk, that want it ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like ("Just the tip!")
And yeah you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say "Why not?"
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Timing all fucked up, thought you had just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say, "Fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?"
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy

[Outro: Dom McLennon]
Uh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin', I'm on a mission
Every time that I speak they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'

[Intro: Joba]
I'm a bad boy, bad habits
If I want it, I got to have it
Plus I'm paranoid, can't stand it
I've been damaged, but I didn't grab it
I'm a bad boy, bad habits
If I want it, I got to have it
Plus I'm paranoid, can't stand it
I've been damaged, but I didn't grab it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund her business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type
Why don't you take your mask off?
That's the thought I had last night
"Why you always rap about bein' gay?" (Bitch)
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay (Bitch)
Where I come from, niggas get called "faggot" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my hand off and, and my legs off and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah
[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
I got my hand on an ounce, so now I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
I took an eighth of them shrooms, now I've been hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I don't think the monsters ever left my bedroom
I been hiding in the closet, outta legroom
I don't know if that little somethin' ever helped you
All I know is I can't trust what's in my head too
I been running from the words I never said to ya
I been duckin' all the judgement, let me say it through ya
I was fighting till they said I can't defend you
All I know is I'm the one you should've stepped to
Uh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin'
I'm on a mission, every time that I speak they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'
[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk that want a ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like
And, yeah, you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say "why not?"
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Time to not fuck up, thought you were just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say "fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?"
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy

[Outro: Joba]
Bad people knockin' on my door, they don't see me
Been screaming at the wall, nobody hear me
There's two parts of me, one disagrees with the other
I switch sides like I'm undercover
Bad people knockin' on my door, they don't see me
Been screaming at the wall, nobody hear me
There's two parts of me, one disagrees with the other
I switch sides like I'm undercover[Lyrics from Leak]

[Sample]
Every time we wrote a song, it was a hit
That was unbelievable
That first beat is right on time
Right on top, like they say

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
I don't fuck with no bitch that ain't been hustling
I grew up way quicker than momma knew back then

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I threw up all that liquor, I was supposed to hold it (Hold it)
When I go out to party, I get paranoia (Lonely)
I'ma island out in public, you supposed to hold me (Hold me)
Fuck 'em when I'm at the store 'cause Shelah put me on, bruh
Damn, I miss the days when I didn't have a lawyer
Damn, I miss the days when I didn't have cable
Damn, I miss the days when I didn't have paper
When the nigga I was bugging wasn't hitting me for favor

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Fifty off the top, the double C was on your backside
Switchin' out positions in the car don't want no tickets
Sneaking undercover, hopping fences in your backyard
I was on the floor, sunbathing just like a reptile
I wish I could scoop you out the pool
Remember the first time I pulled a move?
Well damn, I guess I'm off it cut the check for me not office
My brother been bossin' up like steroids was in his coffee
We all be going through it, with crazy ex-lovers
That make me block my number
But damn you know I gotcha, alright
[Interlude]
What was wrong with the world?
(everybody's talking about the good 'ol days)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I'm all out
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though

[Verse 3: JOBA]
I suppose the 90210 is where people go when they sell their souls
But you know what? It ain't all bad
But just like dough
The more you make, then the more you throw
You threw it all though, you gave it all up
Damn
You used to wanna run for office
Now you just wanna be poppin' so bad
Yachts and mansions, All That like Kenan Thompson
I know your momma
And I know your momma don't approve of the pussy poppin'
She spent her whole life scraping change to put you through college so you had options
Used to love to dance and sing but you've been fucking actors
Blowin' smoke and stealin' keys
Postin' pics in Bentleys
Blowin' coke and eating free
And you ain't shit on TMZ but you're a star to me
[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I can't fuck with no nigga who ain't got no function
I can't trust them no more
I can't fuck with no nigga who ain't got no function
I can't trust you niggas no more
No more

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though

[Interlude: Kevin Doan]
"And then I had like, um, my mom and dad had, like, nail shops and I would, like, go to my mom's and she would have the pedicure chairs. I would sit in them sometimes and just fill them up and put my feet in the water like this and I would make sure it's really high and then like, sometimes, like McDonald's had, like, their happy meals and their toys. And I remember they had surfs up and I got, like, the penguins and stuff and they had, like, the surfboards and l would like, put them in the water and we'd play with them. The toys in the water. And like, I can't imagine, like, I guess adults, like going in to get their nails done would just, like see this kid playing with toys in the water. And this is Kevin Doan, you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."

[Interlude: Kevin Abstract]
"Yo, yo, yo, this is Kevin Cinema. You're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bow! When I remember my first experience with a pool, you know? It was in Corpus Christi, I was visiting my sister. I'm telling you, I swear to God, It was either 1999 or 2000-1999, the only year that I remember... Seriously, I mean it. So, I'm standing, like, towards the edge of the pool. There's a bunch of people there, like my, my sister, my brother, I think my mom. It's a pool on this apartment complex in Corpus. I'm just looking at the water, like, I'm telling myself, like, "Jump in, I'll figure it out. I, I know I can swim..." So, as soon as I jump in, I panic and I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just [inhales deeply], it sounds like this [frantic water splashing] and I can hear people, I can hear people screaming outside. Like it just sounds muffled. They're like "Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh my god!" and I'm just going crazy underwater. Oh, my God, I'm probably about to die-Looking back, this is how I feel. Who knows what my young brain was actually thinking and, like, processing in that moment? Next thing I know, my brother comes into the pool [diving, splash noise] grabs me, pulls me out [chokingly exhales] and like I was scared of the water ever since then, I will never ever get back into the water. But then I learned how to swim. It was great. This is Kevin Cinema and that's one of my earliest memories with water."[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah
I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah

[Verse 1: Joba]
It doesn't rain in L.A
And I'm afraid to see your face
Flashback to the flash floods
And the slow-paced Texas days
We never change, no no
Forever was just a phase
I didn't mean to leave you lonely
I just had to do what's best for me, selfishly
I'll admit that
I'm in a fetal hold, I'm a weak man
I'm a weak man
I hit the ground running
Trippin' on my feet
As the distance between us
Became more than I can see
I hope you're okay
Yeah, I hope you're okay
I went to the beach yesterday
And cried 'cause I missed you
The waves don't crash the same
And the sun still burns me
[Bridge 1: Joba]
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life
(Another day away, another state away)
I'll miss you for all my life
(Another day away, another state away)
I'll love you for all my life
(Another day away)
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I can't stand it here no more
I've been banging at your door
I'm so lost in Hollywood
All that shit I put you through
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, yeah
I'm so sorry
But you won't wait for someday
We had dreams, married Sunday
But I left Texas, now you hate me
In this town where I can't breathe
Yes, I love you, but I can't stay
And you ask why, but I can't say

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Still ain't find all the answers
I don't want to be standard
Surgeries, I've been tampered
Watched her fight and beat cancer
Wasn't ready to let me go
I wasn't ready for life without
Fear one day that I'll make that call
I have to face all my darkest doubts
I can scream when I think of what happens for a reason
Find my ways to fly with everyone, I lost when I'm dreaming
I don't wanna wake up when I get a chance to catch that feeling
Letting go, every second that I live until I stop breathing
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah
I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah
I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah

Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy
It's so mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy

[Verse 4: Kevin Abstract]
You made me do things I don't ever wanna do
You made me say things I don't ever wanna say
You ain't act ways that are natural
I'd rather end up in disaster
Imagine me and you outside
When the wind can't hurt my pride
Imagine me and you in a car crash
Imagine me and you shared a last laugh
Imagine me and you hold hands
Fake ass romantics
Like all the niggas we stanned
Think that's a classic, damn
You let me share your couch with you
I thank you for that
You let me share your house with you
I thank you for that
You let me wipe my mouth with you
I thank you for that
You let me write my songs about you
And I hate you for that
And I can't get it

Better not, better not, better not
Get too dark please
You should call, you should call, you should call
On me to eat
Even when, even when, even when
Night skies bug me

This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for

[Hook: Merlyn Wood]
Never learn my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave
Never learned my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
One more clip for the chamber
I'm gon' live for the labor
I'ma need six hundred lanes
For all of my innovators
Save 'em up for later, pull the gauge up
Cause I'm swinging through the fences
The fire, no consensus
I took a break from college and then became Kanye
They say they throwing three stacks, it make me feel like Andre
I'm losing my archway, coming through the parkway

[Hook: Merlyn Wood]
Never learn my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave
Never learned my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave

Baby boy, don't cry (baby boy, don't cry)
Where's your sense of pride? (where's your pride?)
I laid it on the line
Won't let you fall behind (fall behind)

Who feel Cutty? C-C-Cutty run the band
Who feel Cutty? C-C-Cutty run the band
Who feel Cutty? C-C-Cutty run the band
Who-who-who-who feel Cutty? C-C-Cutty run the band
Who feel Cutty? C-C-Cutty run the band
Woo!
A little less focus on me?
What they sayin' outside?

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Warrior from Corpus, hold the globe in my pocket
My life more predictable than stocks is
We still fighting the same fight that Pac did
Made songs about the neighborhood and then got big
Now I need to give back just like God did
Or more like Hov
Last night when I was stoned I seen an UFO
Thought about how far this shit could actually go
Lord knows all I ever wanted was to be just like my cousin by the stove
Get a rose
I gave you all this music, can I at least get some coze
I told you how I felt and then your mouth froze
Told the world who I was and then my neck froze
Now you acting like a hoe, fuck it, you right, I do
Cause them niggas I was around was the foundation for my crew
That's the foundation for my truth
Turning basements into booths
Termination down the [?]
That's the reason for the loot[Verse: Hoodie Trash]
You're the only one I didn't know I needed in my life
You're the only one I can get behind only this one time
I can see you're bitching about your time on this earth
I think I'm the only one who can clearly see your worth

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time

[Bridge: Hoodie Trash]
I hope I can treat you right
I hope we can win your fight
I hope I can treat you right
I hope we can win your fight

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty and Hoodie Trash]
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
[Outro: Ryan Beatty and Hoodie Trash, (Hoodie Trash)]
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
(At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind)
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time[Quadron Interlude: Quadron, Kevin Abstract, Matt Champion, Shawn Mendes]
"This is Quadron, and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1. Holler at ya"
"Yo, this is Kevin Cinema and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1."
"Ay, this is Matt and this is Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."
"Hey, what's up, it's Shawn Mendes and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."

[Verse: Joba]
It's too damn easy, to hide away, or run away
For me they're both the same, I just need a reason
Before I choose to stay before I choose to say "I love you"
These three simple words, have caused me so much hurt
Ooh, la, la, ooh, la, la
I feel it, I'm feeling, those feelings, I feel them
Ooh
Was told the beauty's in the details
But I'm not the type to say how I might feel
Started in high school, got my diploma
Then dropped out of college, always been a hard-head
Lacking in knowledge
But goddamn, man, when will this end?
I need new friends
And maybe it's okay to fall in love again

[Spoekn Word: Bernie Mac, Charlie Rose]
"If I dedicate myself to one thing, I need to focus on that
If I dedicate myself to something else, I need to focus on that
To try and do all these, and do the road, do stand up, and do a television show and then try to deal with our marriage and our home? Something's gonna give. Something's gonna give and I don't want to do that."
"And what's the most precious to you beyond family?"
"My comedy."
"Comedy. Not the sitcom, not the stand-up, just comedy?"
"My comedy."
"Being able to create truth..."
"Right."
"And enjoy, and entertain"
[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I grew up all alone, my mom and dad fighting
I moved around a lot, I did a lot of fighting
I met my friend Ian, I seen a lot of cyphers
I did a lot of writing

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon and Kevin Abstract]
Watch my uncles duck indictments
I'm used to ramen noodles, victims of mental illness
Products of neighborhoods with broken souls and wounded spirits
Don't judge me by appearance, I moved to California
Started getting paid, (Nigga, you broke) shit's already boring

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Dash into the money like a hyphen, fuck a pipe dream, man
Had this shit when I was in my diapers
Burnin' through my diapers, hot shit, that was hot shit
Back when niggas looking for the Loch Ness

[Verse 4: Matt Champion and Dom McLennon]
Stuck 'round dip spittin' assholes, make they mamas bashful
Got holes in my pockets so my shoes full of cash though
Cigar, Fidel Castro, car full of Castrol
See the sunset when I backstroke, can't swim, but I could act, though

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends
Imagine having no friends, ayy
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends, ayy
Imagine having no friends, man
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends, ayy
Imagine having no friends, man
Ayy, ayy, imagine having no friends, man



[Interview: Cam'ron and DJ Whoo Kid]
"Amazing how back then fame was more important than the business, like-"
"Yeah, you know, that's what I was explaining to somebody. I said I didn't mind gettin' jerked because I was like, I just want my record on the radio, I just wanna shoot videos"
"...And get it popping"
"I just wanna get popping. Look, I don't care-take my publishing, I don't know what that is anyway, you know what I'm saying? Like just take my shit so I can have a video and songs on the radio, I'll figure it out later"
"That's crazy, man"
"And then the next album, I'll start and I'm like, damn, these checks ain't like the checks I'm used to niggas seeing. I'm not being able to get four or five cars or jewelry or things I wanted to get, so I'm like let me figure out what's the loophole in this shit. Why I'm not winning"
"But isn't it crazy that it makes you question what kind of friends you had back then? Because they weren't telling you how the business was running and they were just-"
"See, that goes to show, maybe they wasn't never really my friends..."

I wanna kiss a man on the moon
And I just gotta say, out of everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you
I wanna kiss a man on the moon
And I just wanna say, out of everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you[Verse 1: Joba and Kevin Abstract]
Your lipstick burns my lips
But I think I'm still in love with you
Your eyes drip black
But I think you're still in love with me
But it feels like there's no air to breathe again (In the pink skies)
And it feels like I'm drowning in love again (I can't swim)
I'm afraid I'll lose all that I have again (Her eyes were red)
But I'm ready for the truth (Love me not)

[Chorus: Joba]
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)

[Bridge: Joba]
I've been a fool (ooo, aa-aah)

[Verse 2: Joba and Kevin Abstract]
You say I care too much
But what does that even mean
You say I need some space
But what does that mean for me
It feels like I've fallen and fell again (the car crash)
And it feels like there's no hope for us again (you were high as hell)
I'm afraid you'll leave me for a better man (I try my hardest)
But I'm ready for the truth (love me not)
[Chorus: Joba]
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)

[Outro: Joba and Kevin Abstract]
My head was spinning (I've been a fool)
I lost, I lost it (I've been a fool)
I've been a fool (ooo, aa-ah)
Ah-ha-ha

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
What I gotta do?
Keep it real with you
Stuck inside my truth
Spendin' all my loot
Diamond on my tooth
R.I.P. my brother Luk
When I spit, let it hit, hit a double U
Couple rainbows, my lil' halo
Think it's J-Lo, bro don't say so
Homie don't play, no
Takin' my day slow
Takin' my ray, throw
Talkin' to angels
Speedin' a pave' though
Changin' a page though
Lookin' like ace, talkin' 'bout spade, you are afraid though
Spendin' my queso
All on some fake clothes
When I change, never say, this is my blaze throat
South Central
All my homies know
If I could go, I would just wait though

[Verse 2: Joba]
Anyways, gotta go, disregard what I say
Grain of salt, sprinkle some over the shoulder, ayy
Lucky Strike, filterless, don't push me, 'kay?
Sensitive, abrasive, stab you in the face
Keep a blade, heaven sakes, had to raise the stakes
Dracula, in a cave, a bit lonely, mane
Grab a stake, have a cape, it don't work no more
Fly away, different ways, hit the liquor store
Better days, follow me like the saddest song
Grab a case, hideaway, fill my loads with bleach
Couple stains ain't a game, they both hauntin' me
Lot to say, people hate, wearin' blindfolds
Now where did I go? Where do we go?
How do we grow? How should I know?
Feel responsible, intolerable, displaced (Uh-huh), insane

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Piss 'em off, piss 'em off, piss 'em off
Shit, I better set it off
I just made a deposit, CDG in my closets
Fuel ain't really made of fossils
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Spying on your ho from a SpaceX rocket
She wanna know why my wrist so rocky
Flash splash on me, photocopy
My weed, my weed at the party
Shoot me a sheriff for Trayvon Martin
King, Ali, and Bobby Marley
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
You know

[Refrain: bearface]
I wish you'd love me for life
Love me for life, love me for life, wish you would lie
I wish you'd love me for life
Love me for life, love me for life, I will
Love, love me for, yeah
Love me, love me for life
Love, love me for life

I'm around you when you answer
I'd feel better if you sent a sign
Lonely when your friends around
Solo 'til the sun go down
I just wish that I could read your mind

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Call me after midnight
Pull up on your lawn like
Baby boy, are you alright?
Call me after midnight
Call me after midnight
Pull up on your lawn like
Baby boy, are you alright?
Call me after midnight

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Wildin' out 'til tomorrow, could be my only lotto
Kicked out of my momma's house, back when I was suicidal
I ain't even smoke, he taught me how to shoot a gun
Why the fuck you get me drunk and leave me in the road?
I need a way out, so sure that I could get out, ugh
And I'mma hideout, highways I could find out, one
Ride that bank like a 6, you're the reason I lace
My shoes in different ass ways
[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Call me after midnight
Pull up on your lawn like
Baby boy, are you alright?
Call me after midnightLyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Me and my boys, we just like [?], keep it in my pack
Me and my boys, we speak like Birdman, plus I'm like my dad
Me and my boys, me and my boys, boys, boys, boys
Me and my boys, me and my boys, boys, boys, boys

Me and my boys (Me and my boys)

Now everybody talkin' 'bout it
I don't trust nobody

That's what I tell my partner
Now everybody talkin' 'bout it
I don't trust nobody

That's what I tell my partner

[Verse 2: Joba]
I can be your genie in a bottle if you stroke my spout
Your knight in shining armor if you wanna joust
Just tickle my tummy, make me blush, let me out
It really ain't that complicated
Y'all got me exacerbated
Spirit on the up and up, the ceiling comin' down
Set my sights for the moon and sun
I'm blinded by the light to come
Had glimpses of the life I want
Well I'm up in smoke, just leave me alone
And I pack my bags to find a home
I found that shit, don't ring my phone
Bless myself like it's going out of style
Crack a smile, flip the bird, cement my feet into the Earth
I grant my own wish
No thanks to you, bitch
I'll be gone quick, I'm free and wild, shit[Interlude: Merlyn Wood]
"Hi, this is Merlyn Wood and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1. I think I was about eight when my parents got me a fish tank and some of those fish with the see through skin, so you can see their skeleton. And I also had a blue fish... They're all dead now, um, and I buried them in the backyard. I mean if, if water kills fish, what chance do I got? What chance do I got? I mean, if water kills fish, what chance do I got?"

Dun-dun, dun-dun

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing me
I think I fell in love again in Michigan

Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing me
I think I fell in love again in Michigan

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I ain't the same nigga that I once was
I lost my fucking mind and then I fell in love
I did a bunch of drugs because I couldn't sleep
I lost a couple months, I chipped my fucking teeth
And there's a couple women and they know some things
About lies that I done told and shit that I done said
And niggas that I robbed, so I'm real paranoid
I have voices in my head

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Hi, my name is Merlyn, I just applied for food stamps
I just moved to California, with my boy band
Dropped out of a good school, hippies in my commune
I left 'fore the rent was due
Used to want a briefcase and a short commute
Used to wanna sell coke and whip an Audi coupe
Crazy, if I did that, wouldn't be talking to you
Walking through the pitfalls of a college student
Crazy how you get them letters and that make you feel accepted
'Til you walking 'round the campus and you the only African
Nobody with passion, just cats that take direction well
Take acid trips to find themselves, well...

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I gotta get better at being me (At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)
[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Ever since I moved out, I've been broke
Ever since I grew up, I've been ugly
Ooh, I need get me some dollar, dollar, dollar bills y'all
Ever since I left my momma house
I've been mad as hell at the world
Sometimes you don't gotta rhyme when you feel it
Sometimes I barely ever feel a fucking thing
Sometimes I wish that my fucking phone would fucking ring
And go off, and wake a nigga up
I'm used to being sad and I'm used to being down
I'm used to being used, I miss my boy being around

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I gotta get better at being me (At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Dropping all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I gotta get better at being me (At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)

[Outro: Dom McLennon]
I'm trying to look for motivation of smaller things
But baby steps to my atonement when I foster dreams
I've been told I'm too transparent with my thoughts sometimes
So I wrote songs until they pass and I can fall in line
I fell apart the moment that you thought you found yourself
'Cause I knew at that point, I couldn't be in the equation anymore
But moving on with open, broken hearts
Will show you everything you need to see about yourself to start moving forward
So many things I wanna say that I'm not sure need to be known
But everybody swears they fucking know me
So why, don't I lay every card I'm holding on the table?
At that point I wonder what they'd show me
I almost lost my father, still surreal for me to think about
Considering how many of my friends have lost theirs
I never know if what I'm saying is the right thing
If not, I'm ready more than ever for the crosshairs
It's all fair when it's not you
Some people have angels, what if only shadows follow you?
And all the ghosts inside that seem to hollow you
The branches of the weeping willow start to swallow you
And then you realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be
The horizon clears, you wipe the tears
And all the skeletons are ready for your story

[Intro: Kevin Abstract, Bunny Sigler and DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Hey, kids? (Yeah)
How you feelin'? (Fine)
You feel alright? (Yeah)
I wanna be more like a child, they question everything
Like, "Momma, where is your wedding ring?"
The dust still settlin'
Aight then, I'm settled in
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I'm tryna go in, I hope you niggas know it
Young boy, I ain't heroic
They hurtin', free they soul bitch
You poor fool, think you know it
My boy got the heater loaded
So I don't trip too often
Reportin' live from Kaufman
These my dawgs for life
Until I see a coffin
Them trees, they got me coughin'
I'm ridin' around, I'm cautious
We yellin', "Fuck the law, bitch"
We finna get it started
We youngin' and we wildin'
That bread keep multiplyin'
That pain just keep on comin'
Bring that Holy Water, we fuckin' underwater
We jackin' off each other on the beach, then cum in the water
That's that Holy Water
That's that Florida shit, that 305, that guala, guala
Might not see tomorrow
Wash the evil from your heart, that's a verse I borrowed
I see y'all boys tomorrow

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
We bring the mob out, we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, ayy
We bring the mob out (Ayy), we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, yeah
We bring the mob out, we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, ayy
We bring the mob out (Ayy), we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down (Yay)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'm that nigga from the East side, ready to bang out on your set
I do not care 'bout who in front of me if they ain't handin' checks
Holdin my dogs down to the right and I got my baby to the left
Both of 'em been on high alert for any sign of disrespect
So where your head at player?
You in the mud or you in the clouds
You with your plug when the shit went down
Now you both got blood that you can't get out
Hope we don't drown, niggas is clowns
But it ain't no ringleader in that circus
Rollin' up dreams, smoke away my purpose
How a nigga hollow with a bulletproof surface, damn

[Bridge: bearface]
Push start, baby, like she drive a Benz truck (Woo)
You ain't got no money, she don't wanna link up (Grr)
And if he fuck up, it's one call to the mob (Grr)
Pull up 'round the corner and we make the block hot

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
No reassurance, this here, I burn it
I got insurance for the way I'm 'bout to shock the systems
About that action, blow the pistons
Cut ties, better learn 'bout subtraction
Can't keep up, get it out my system
What we missin'?
Need that boom, boom, boom, boom
Drop it out

[Chorus: Matt Champion and Kevin Abstract]
We bring the mob out, we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, ayy
We bring the mob out (Ayy), we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, yeah
We bring the mob out (Bring the mob), we finna mob out (Finna mob)
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy (Leave your jaw)
Leave your jaw down, ayy
We bring the mob out (Bring the mob), we finna mob out (Finna mob)
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy (Leave your jaw)
Leave your jaw down, yay

[Outro: Ponderosa Twins Plus One]
Did it last night I heard you say (Heard you say)
Love 'em all but dying, 'cause I was in the way
Well, if you don't mind (I just need you here with momma)
I think I'll leave (I think I'll leave)
Leave 'em all together, means everything to me



Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Found these versions, making me feel so [?]
Self-medicating, but I don't think they'll find it
Turns out I found peace in the dark but now I'm waking up on top floors
Morning [?], the morning and the morning
What am I doing this for? What am I doing this for?

[Chorus]
Okay, four in the morning like a ghost
Oh yeah, [?] the most
Okay, here we go again
Seeing it all, seemingly fall, babe

[Mashed-up Samples]

[Spoken Word: Ariel Wendt]
Through the quicksand, the wind, and the bush in between
Someone has to shine
The boys of the wild found each other during their time of need
And chose to turn to each other in order to grow
Learn, learn, share, hope
Running away from home, facing the fears of the real world
Maintaining to hold on to the idea that connected them all to this is difficult
Challenging, there's something different in the air
The clouds are changing, weapons, love, heartbreak, and everything in between
Dirty, filthy boys
Don't let this one dieLyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Tech-Techinical

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Get you immersed with and burst your bubble
The trouble that we be surfin' through
It hurts to choose, I gotta face the truth
My brother face the judge, I can't face the drugs
And corporates dogs, man, they lace the drugs
Just don't be a weirdo unless it's natural
Like my dreads and my bed, so lonely
Thank God for the homies
Thank God for the groceries that you brought through
'Cause we was gettin' hungry, niggas know that I'm a lot to
I got a lot to lose, when the pressure's on, the light's cool
The box is new, ain't nobody watchin' you
So how could we be robbin' you?
I make more thank you think, I think more than you think
If I keep goin' at this rate, I'll be your brain next week
I moved on in my sleep, I got it done in a week
Been possessed by my old self
Fuckin' with the Devil got me fuckin' hella old still
Money that I owed still, my father paid his phone bill
(That's his karma comin' back)
'Cause I ain't seen his crib still, I ain't met his kids still
I'm tryna have a kid still
Ayy, yo
[Break: Kevin Abstract and Ryan Beatty]
Need ya, need ya to get back
Need ya, need ya to get (I need you to)
Need ya, need ya to get back
Need ya, need ya to get, I need you to need me
Get back, finding to get physical
Want this to be easy, get back
'Cause you know that easy come and easy go
Need ya, need ya to get, I need you to need me
Get back, finding to get physical
Want this to be easy, get back
'Cause you know that easy come and easy go

I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (Now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would (Cool)
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (Now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would (Cool)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Probably gon' shoot me if they see me
Now I'm on your TV, looking for a genie
Told him I was genius, I don't do bleeding
I need another season, they ain't seeing what I'm seeing, no?
You might never wan' be me, no?
Even when my skin greasy, no?
McDonald's would've been the more fire option
The barely famous shit is getting really fucking toxic
I used to wanna be Ali, I tried to be a boxer
Until you told me I could sing just like Mariah
And started-right?

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Backup, I don't need no backup
Block out all the chatter
Missing all the gin lined up at the tavern
All the same pattern, chokin' on tobacco
Rinsing down my face in bathroom, ah
Up and down
I don't see me how you see me
Maybe not wanna be me, but I love me, love me down
Often I be with my baby, clear water runnin' navy
See me, are you ready?
Up and down
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would (Cool)

[Verse 3: Joba]
Nevermind what I thought I knew
How could I know?
These days I just stay on the move
Need to go home, everything I ever wanted I got
Doesn't really make me happy, is this really what I wanted?
Oh God
When it feels right it's wrong, I swear
They tell me let go, let God
So I let go sometimes
Just to play with the fire
I come alive late at night
Been workin' overtime, got too much on my mind
An out of sight state of mind
[Spoken Word: Jim Carrey]
"What I want doesn't stem from showbusiness, uh, generally. I mean- I started out with many many desires as far as- as far as this business goes and uh, I've so surpassed all of them that I- that it's- it's not as meaningful to me anymore. I really love the work itself. I've examined myself on several occasions: 'Why am I really doing this? Am I doing this because I want to be famous?' And I think there was an element to that when I first started out, I wanted to be a rainmaker."

[Intro: Matt Champion]
"-perfectly fine, that's fine!"

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Said nigga brother, nigga brother, what you living for?
Is you gon' finish what you started? What you quitting for?
They told me God gave me a mission
But I'm missing the supplies to complete it
I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated
So nigga, brother who you standing with?
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
Brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire
Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth
It's telling me "Decapitate everything for what it's worth!"
When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
I don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work
I'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth
See the canvas as a planet I'm commanding with my nerves, ah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions

[Bridge: bearface]
Try to treat man like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Boy, you know you don't look fly
Them gold chains turn your neck green, bye
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Nothin' different now (woo!) all around now (woo!)
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the ego now, what that make of me?
Angle widescreen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
Chin up little son, I slide in like the macarena
Lose time, pen it, style spiced on, jalapeno
Supersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, slightly
Silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this Martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

[Verse 3: Joba]
Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up
Have my wings clipped, I don't need them shits
Learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear
I've never been up top but I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Jaden]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
Hoo! Voodoo Man
Momma took me to the church and I sang a hymn
Co-colonized Chris-ti-an
Now I'm losing my reli-gi-on
God damn, so narcissistic this millennium
Fuck you and the bubble that you livin' in
I don't go to church, but I'm so spiritual
Pulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle
If Jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?
All these diamonds in my face, I'm shining like the day
I'm living in my prime, man, what can I say?
If the service is an hour, I'm an hour late

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy
Lowly lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else
Get nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Late night corner, we pass
Lick that Swisher, get red
Used to skip rocks 'round that bend
We don't go there no more
We don't see sun no more
Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye
Everything 'cept the dog
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, and Deb Never and Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed
More like God's special mess, never had no halo
Trippy, I can barely hike it out of bed
Time bomb under it, persuading you to hop in
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options

[Pre-Chorus: Deb Never and Kevin Abstract]
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, and Deb Never and Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams
Depression put me into places where I'm stuck in the seams
They sealed my mouth and said the only way to breathe is to scream
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees
The machines weavin' our fate are gettin' harder to please
But I believe to an extreme
(That we all can find a way)
To anybody listenin' that's in between
(That we all can find a way)

[Verse 4: Joba]
Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit
Been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am
Been thinkin' I am better than Him
In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here

[Bridge: bearface]
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute)
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go)
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute)
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go)

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, and Deb Never and Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Something changed in Texas, guess I missed the message
Look I missed my exit, I'm living like a Jetson
I was broke and desperate, leaning on my best friends
Only shot-callers I was around was bartending
Ain't no love in this game-[Intro: Jabari Manwa and DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties
Niggas stay talkin', they ain't about shit
Pull off, fetti stay in my wallet
Mind gone, mind gone insane
Yo, if you got a problem then don't call to me
Mans keep talking like he a prophet (Woah-woah)
No time to learn that we ain't 'bout it (Woah-woah)
Mind gone, mind gone insane
Yo, if it ain't a problem then don't call to me
I said
Pardon the uh, technical difficulties

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
And I ain't taking "no" no more
Them niggas grew up on Screw
What the fuck dawg, now we getting back to the beginning
The game a scrimmage, I play to finish
Remember them old days, I was fucking 'round with women
We was backin' up them drives like we was finished
Runnin' 'round Corpus, two-door, I explore
Hit the gas then he floor it
We just took off with some more shit-

[Verse 2: Matt Champion and DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Pray to God to keep my money straight
My four SUVs behind me like motorcade
Shot on that bitch at alarming rate
Chills in your body they glisten and shimmer like you just went out of the armory, uh-uh
Move he dippin and dive whenever you cry, I will arrive
Blood, sweat and tears will let you go fly
But how do you float, uh-uh, staying afloat, uh-uh
Shoutout Big Chuck, Conan, and Bert
Shoutout Chris, Chloe, and Kelly
I'm going fast, you ready?
I keep the celly on silent
I hope the future is vibrant
For all of my brothers, all of my kin, all of my fans
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties
[Refrain: bearface]
Big tr-, big tr-, big tr-, big tr-
(The, the, the, the, the beginning!)
Big trauma, stone-cold stunner (Woo)
Shotgunner, hot like summer
My lover, ain't no sucker
She'll break your windows, that's no fun, uh
Big trauma, stone-cold stunner (Woo)
Shotgunner, hot like summer
My lover, ain't no sucker
She'll break your windows, that's no fun, uh

[Outro: Kevin Abstract and DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Close the door
Watch me go
I'm gettin' close to God
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be still pimpin'
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be-
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be still pimpin'
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be still pimpin'
I'm livin' in the Sou-
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I'm screwed up, different mindset
I'm a hot boy, I need a hot chick
I can't be loveless on sunset
I play the cup 'til ain't nothing left
Ride your bitch, while you ride a bench
I'm no pimp, but I know the steps
I came in with your Chanel stench
I'm from Texas, I don't run from shit

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-dum
I'll feed your fantasy
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-dum
Tell me what I have to say

[Scratches: Merlyn Wood]

[Chorus: Dijon and Matt Champion]
Yeah, one fifty on the dash
I'mma hit you when the phone ring twice
Okay, and I'mma meet you outside
Okay, and I'mma-
One fifty on the dash
I'ma hit you when the phone ring twice
Okay, and I'mma meet you outside
Okay, and I'mma-

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Good mornin', we lookin' for a function
I know you niggas love to push my buttons
Tell the Lord to call me back
Tell Ferg to hit me back, and it'll be a rap
I know my niggas still waitin' on "BANKROLL"
And the album almost done, it's on the way, though
It's like the days we was singin' about Waco
Gotta get it right, so baby, wait though
San Marcos, couldn't afford no queso
I praise to Allah 'cause we all got some pesos
Compose the history like Beethoven
I throw in the moon, what's the froze and the fresh
Just be hopin', we golden, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Are the lights on? I can't find you
This is our song, this is our song
Got my hands up, got my head down
All my tears fall on the dance floor
To our song

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Look how I'm feelin', shakin' it down like that
Nobody comes close to the spot you used to have
Everyone here wants you, yeah, they want what you have
I know that you don't see it, that's what I like about you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's what I like about you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's what I like about you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Are the lights, lights, lights
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Are the lights on? I can't find you
This is our song, this is our song
Got my hands up, got my head down
All my tears fall on the dance floor
To our song

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
All of my- (Yeah), all of my- (Yeah)
All of my- (Yeah), all of my- (Yeah)
Taken for weak, taken for weak
Taken for weak, taken for weak
All of my- (Yeah), all of my- (Yeah)
All of my- (Yeah), all of my- (Yeah)
Taken for weak, taken for weak
Taken for weak, taken for weak
[?]
Lights off[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
On a palace floor I see my soul
Banging through the doors, we swing 'em closed
We need glass or something strong
For the creeps when you come 'round

[Bridge: Bearface]
I feel like fucking on the west side like bullets out a gun
These strangers coming out about twice as strong
Yeah, I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

[Chorus: Joba]
I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I'm everything I am
I'm everything I am
But you don't know me
I'm everything I am
With everything I am
You don't know me

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Hold me down, I know I've lost control
Picking up all of my dirty bones
Oh I know there's something wrong
Freak me out when you come round
[Bridge: Bearface]
I feel like fucking on the west side like bullets out a gun
These strangers coming out about twice as strong
Yeah, I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

[Chorus: Joba]
I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I'm everything I am
I'm everything I am
But you don't know me
I'm everything I am
With everything I am
You don't know me

[Outro: Joba]
At all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all (You don't know)
At all, at all, at all, at all

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Ryan Beatty]
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you

[Verse: Ryan Beatty and Kevin Abstract]
You wanna talk
The words rollin' out
I'll be right there
I'll save you from your bedroom
Move to Utah (I'll be there)
And I'll be okay (I'll be there)
The reason I thank you
I know heaven don't exist for fools

[Extended Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Ryan Beatty]
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you



[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I know who you are
I know the type of niggas you let in your car
I know I'm not special babe
I know everything you hate
The freckles on your fuckin' face
Makes the most sense to me

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Two, O, O, seven
Two, O, O, eight
Two, O, O, nine
You, I can't relate
You, a different place
You, a different space
You, I hesitate, for you I never wait
Never wait

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn



[Verse]
Gotta find a way to explain without sounding cliche
That I'm the one that I hate
That I'm the one I wish the Sun would cause to disintegrate
Think I'm a little too late to be playing this game
Without knowing the rules
Oh, I'm gonna lose
I think I'm gonna lose my last dollar to an orange tip revolver
To a pickpocket, unconcerned with my wallet
And I'll quit talkin', and ignore all the karma
That I still don't get, wanna die like a lawyer
Leave my kids somethin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I spent way too much time thinkin'
'Bout all the ways I'm sleepin'
I'm wastin' my life dreamin'
Dreams I can't remember, it's all bullshit
You got motives for sendin' your well wishes
Bet you use me up, forget me like I'm Chapstick
Hope my lips pretend I hemorrhage like an oil spill

[Chorus]
Hope it feels good to be right (Hope it feels good)
Hope it feels good to be right (I hope it feels good)
Hope it feels good to be right (Hope it feels good)
Hope it feels good to be right (I hope it feels good)
Hope it feels good

[Bridge]
Bet I'm buried in my sleep in an unmarked grave
Bet I'm dying alone with a smile on my face
It's the end of the world and I couldn't care less
Probably do what I'm told by the idiots
I bet that I'll deserve everything that I get
Bet I'll try to pick a fight with my dying breath

[Chorus]
Hope it feels good to be right
Hope it feels good to be right
Hope it feels good to be right
Hope it feels good

[Outro]
It's all bullshit (Hope it feels good to be right)
You got motives for sendin' your well wishes
(Hope it feels good to be right)
Bet you use me up, forget me like I'm Chapstick
(Hope it feels good to be right)
Hope my lips pretend I hemorrhage like an oil spill
(Hope it feels good to be right)
Hope it feels good to be right (Hope it feels good)
Hope it feels good to be right (I hope it feels good)
Hope it feels good to be right (Hope it feels good)
Hope it feels good to be right (I hope it feels good)
Hope it feels good



[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Jabari, mi paddy

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
Only talkin' numbers like it's binary code
I need all the ones and zeros like we piloting drones
I move like Neo through the Matrix, you won't find me alone
'Cause I'm a dog and you might find out if you reach for my bone
How you unique if everyone around you's next to a clone?
How you gon' gentrify the trap until it's passing your home?
These gowns and caps ain't got [?] to match with the tone
I take a trip but never slip, you can keep your chaperones
I might, I might train in my city, if you from there, you know
I bring the color to a planet livin' in monochrome
I crack the wall then fill it up like it came from Al Capone
If you need paper, I need favors, we could trade for a loan
'Cause me and Bari set our base now, LeBron with the chase style
Give me what I need and I won't have to catch a case now
And your sleeves, you think you got it next 'cause you ain't got the [?] to see
If you can't win without it, you a gimmick and disgrace
Nigga, I don't got no damn opponents (Woo), I came from the coldest
Where the bullets freeze 'em buildings and the police never notice
I'm a trooper, stayin' posted, they don't got ties to the state
But they got ties to the family and we got money to make
Let's go



[Verse 1]
What's the point in having memories if I'll forget them?
What's the point in having friends since they all left?
You could say I was the one that left my friends
But I wanted to be with them till the end

I wanted my grandpa till the end but now he's dead
Good 10 years for him was ahead
I care about everyone, that's what I said
But no one in public cares about me, so I cry in bed

If I had a dollar for every time someone said they hate me
I'd have enough to grow like 50 money trees
Then maybe I wouldn't have had to steal money
Maybe I wouldn't steal from my family

Mom, I'm sorry for all the hurdles
That I set up for you myself
It affected yours and my mental health
You tell me you love me, but you probably stopped thinking that for a second

[Chorus]
You can't live life
Without leaving something behind
Sacrifices are a part of living
Let it go, so you don't drown in the swimming

You can't live life
Without leaving something behind
Sacrifices are a part of living
Let it go, so you don't drown in the swimming

[Verse 2]
I wonder how William is, hope he's having a good life
I wonder how Mehvish is, probably wishes death threats to me at night
But honestly, I completely understand why
They would leave me all  over time

I really try to be nice
But no one cares, so I'm left behind
It seems like there's no love in sight
Guess that's how logic in life goes, it's a homicide

It would be cool if I had someone to talk to while I fight
These pains that I have, don't even have a knife
To kill myself or kill others, don't have any might
But I don't wanna do it anyway, love is what I strive

Do you think I like having to cry?
You think I like trying to fit in, by using women and getting high?
I don't ever wanna do that, so they hate me and tell me to die
So you know what, goodbye!

[Chorus]
You can't live life
Without leaving something behind
Sacrifices are a part of living
Let it go, so you don't drown in the swimming

You can't live life
Without leaving something behind
Sacrifices are a part of living
Let it go, so you don't drown in the swimming

[Outro]
And no, I'm not gonna hurt myself
I just wanna try and tell you to accept everyone
And just cherish what you have in life
You never know when you'll lose something or lose yourself

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
You are just poison, I put that on my grave
No need for aggression, I just need to behave
But your love is poison, I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction, I know that you want control

[Verse: Ameer Vann]
You are my drugs, you are what I need
The love of my life, you kiss me, I bleed
At night when I fiend, I'm grinding my teeth
I get high when you speak, if I could jump I could fly
It's so cold in the clouds, but I stay in the sky
And I see you on the ground, I guess it wasn't the same
You know I smoke and you drank, we ain't one in the same
I can't remember your name, but I remember your scent
And I remember your face, and I remember the...
And I remember the days, we wasn't stuck in our ways
Not a subject for change, I'm just a rat in your maze
And your venom's to blame

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
You are just poison, I put that on my grave
No need for aggression, I just need to behave
But your love is poison, I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction, I know that you want control
[Outro: Joba]
Poison, poison
Poison, poison[Interlude]
Hey, this is Davy, with, uh, Davy's, uh-uh, Pool Cl-Pool Heater and Cleaner cool spots and I just wanted to throw a little ad out here. Um, when we have a new hydro cleaner and it's impeccable and does great wonders for your pool and spa. I think, uh, well I don't necessarily mean spa, but you know. Hot tubs, and such as that. But uh, yeah go get it. It's on the market. Right now, you can get it at your local Lowe's or your local Home Depot or your local Home Improvement, anything such. Maybe some of the local businesses might have it here in the California area. But, uh, yeah, I'm over here, I'm on, uh, eighty thee Gravy street just waiting to see, but anyway... Uh, thanks for letting me on the show, I appreciate it and hopefully you guys will go get that hydro cleaner and it'll do wonders for you, and it'll-it'll just brighten up the summertime. And I know summer's coming to an end soon, but you know hot tubs are year-round for me..."Lyrics from Snippet

Girl, I can't play it, I'm tryin'
Now you're beggin' me for my time
Now you want my attention
Don't know your intentions
You don't seem to get it and I don't think that you are the world
Start thinkin' 'bout life, now I'm wearin' Prada
And I'm almost dyin'
Is it even worth tryin'

We put up a fight
But I gotta say goodbye
And baby, it doesn't have to be
Baby, it doesn't have to be
Do it to my life
Can you do it to my life?
Baby, it doesn't have to be
I know when I gotta go, now

[Lyrics from leak]

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Ayy boy, (You can turn it up a little bit)
Ayy boy, calm your ass down boy (this that down South)
You know what I'm talkin' about?

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
This that down South nigga music
This that Whitney Houston, museum, movement music
That them niggas ain't used to
I bought a car that I can't scoot in and there's some clothes that I just looked at
Ever since I heard we playin' Coachella
I took a stack and made a rap and I ain't never look back
It make me sad when my parents wanna come to the shows
'Cause I diss 'em in my songs and they know every word
All my niggas get along but their egos berserk
'Cause we finally getting money and the girls wanna twerk
And I love doin' Perc', I had to buy me a Perc'
I gotta purse for my nephew now his classmates stare
"Oh, your uncle a rapper? Is he Lil Uzi Vert?"
"Nah, my uncle is gay and they think he a gimmick"
How the fuck I'm a gimmick if I'm up at the clinic
Gettin' tested 'cause I take dick so motherfuckin' often
Bitches better calm me down before I motherfuckin' toss 'em
Ayy, nigga

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Dom McLennon and Matt Champion]
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
(At night I bring them out, I was)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Sleeping upside down, keep you up, I come around
They stay right up on my tail, hopin' it's a fishscale
Human, I see through your eyes
Until my CCC and see blood in my skin
They can see they move my feet like DDR
Hangin' out the car, dreamin' of the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back
Hope the dollar kill me last, hate the way they really see me
Christina I move like genie
My nose wrinkle lot like Jeannie
Regal feelings, I steam it
Hop in the four and I'm speedin', bleedin'
She wavin' out the backseat, ayy, gettin' nasty
Killa motion, phone beep for the C4, bitch I'm coastin'
(Let me hear that)

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
Swimmin' in money, I know that they love me
They pay me in hundreds or pay me in gold (oh)
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I feel alone, I sold a piece of my soul (please)
I don't feel love anymore, where did it go?
I got a heart and then filled it with holes
Dipped it with glitter and gold
I wanna die, but it's some shit I should buy
Feelin' so empty inside (oh)
The more that I get, the less I can feel
The more that I smoke, the more I forget
I hit the road with my bitch in my whip, that's all

[Bridge]
Somebody help me now, right now
Oh, somebody check it out, yellow
Please, somebody help me now, right now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist (oh)
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist (please)
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
Alright, yeah, woo! Now nigga, what's the word?
I got a thousand dollar one-way train to Luxembourg
I'm drinkin' whiskey with no ice, I feel my stomach burn
I made a life I want, I know that make your stomach turn
We sprinting slowly towards our ending, how will you submerge?
I'm drownin' daily in my seat that's why my dreams absurd
I'm noddin' out behind the wheel, don't know 'bout who concerned (let me hear how that sounds)

[Chorus: Joba]
I wish you knew it's not your fault
I feel like you should smile some more
You cried a single tear that's all
What's meant to be prevails

[Lyrics from Snippet]

The weight on my shoulders
I just can't get over
He won't take me back
But he still got my heart
The weight on my shoulders
I just can't get over
He won't take me back
And they don't know how hard it is

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Skinny boy, skinny boy, where your muscles at?
Used to walk to work, eight hours, take the bus back
Ain't no time to stop, ain't no time for vacation
Y'all all want my spot 'cause you know that I am A1
All these pretty girls, they come running to our faces
I could do without, I could move without, I could do myself
I get in a rut, I feel depressed, I bang on my chest
I say fuck 'em all 'til I'm dead

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
First off, fuck Dolce and Gabbana (Fuck em, fuck 'em)
Racist mothersuckers tryna be my pana (Pana, pana)
Put that on me auntie and me mama (Mommy, mommy)
Grab the Ghost then I go right back to Ghana (Skrrt)
I came back again (Ayy, ayy), with the platinum (Ayy, ayy)
To the continent (Ayy, ayy), I came back again (Ayy, ayy)
I came back again (Ayy, ayy), with the platinum (Ayy, ayy)
To the continent (Ayy, ayy), I came back again (Ayy, ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion and Kevin Abstract]
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Got a lot of things to say that I could never finish
Told my mama, "I'll be back, just gotta kill another mission"
Gimme thirty seconds and I'll make off with a billion
Every verse a heist for all your underlying feelings
Got canaries on the window, smell like roses on the ceiling
Oh what a-, oh what a-, oh, how appealing
Candy paint revealing all that bullshit you concealing
Fuck what you been hearing, I'm everything they fearing
I'm black and smart and sexy, universally appealing
Genius what I'm dealing, something they ain't stealing
They prohibited the potents, might give you cirrhosis
Spaceship doing donuts, it's written, I'm the POTUS
I'm focused

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion and Kevin Abstract]
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
Barre Baby, spilled syrup on my big wheel
You could call me lil nigga with the big crib
My lifestyle still the same, just a face lift
Silly niggas got me running out of patience
My whole life slowly turned into a daydream
I hit the bank with a smile on my face, man
Pretty women always pullin' at my waistband
Used to get arrested, all I get is checks now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side[Chorus: bearface]
Cut your thighs
You want me blind
I wish you cried too
And lately I, pressing your time, shaking I'm through

[Verse: bearface]
Thank you notes came falling out your mouth
Never wished for you to see it, was never what we were about
Only color in your eyes when you look me through that blue
Now you're sinking 'cause the water risin' up around your collar
If you wish to call me over, I'd be right around the corner
I'd be in the water with ya, I'd be sinking with you
But you

[Chorus: bearface]
Cut your thighs
You want me blind
I wish you cried too
And lately I, pressing your time, shaking I'm through

[Bridge: bearface]
Stay clear, ah
Stay clear, ooo
Stay clear, ah-ahh
Stay clear, ooo
[Outro: bearface]
Hundred thousand miles gone to form your lie
Comatose and left on a fault line
Hold me back or I'll fall on cold old light
Come to us for fixing your sore mind
Hundred thousand miles gone to form your lie
Comatose and left on a fault line
The fault line
The fault line
The fault line, yeah
The fault line

[Intro: Joba]
Baby child
Lift your head and free your mind
Open up your eyes, and you'll find you will fly
Just smile sometime
Welcome to the real world

[Verse 1: Joba]
Everybody pray for peace when they don't have the power
A disconnect of intellect
Know some people packing straps, you could call 'em cowards
The realest Gs I ever met
Not on the gangster shit, not on the paper shit
Just on that have to provide for my kids and shit
There's blood on the streets
And if I had a dream, I would do anything, I make mistakes
The shit that you hear about ain't just in movies
Dog, I've seen some shit
Bag 'em up in body bags, zip 'em up and send 'em
Away from the kids
I know good felons, good drug dealers, good people
Bad system, bad people
With power
If you gotta dream and you know what that means
You can do anything, just make a change

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes I think back to the ninth-grade campus
When that white boy made fun of my lips
I should've thrown a tantrum
But I remained cool cause he was way too handsome
Now I'm out in Beverly Hills using a mansion as my canvas
I bought a helicopter, threw that bitch on stage
RCA gave us money, we ain't throw it away
We took that shit, we flipped that shit
We made this company pop
They like me, I want 'em to love me like them niggas love Pac
I'm De La Soul meets Tribe Called Quest meets Oasis inside a G-Unit vest
I moved way out to the West side
But still got the South in my heart
They murdered Selena, now them niggas looking for God
Dressed like a soldier, told ya, they don't know who we are
My vest is on, let 'em know we ready for war
In the club with my boyfriend
We paranoid 'cause, we might get popped
'Cause a nigga on some bullshit
Why you wanna hate me now or ask the skies to lay me down?
I hear my brother praying now, I really need an angel now
Some type of holy savior
Ayo, Dad, do me a favor, could you pick me up later, later, later?

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I've been exploring through the Joyful
The Sorrowful and Glorious Mysteries
Historians romanticize notorious victories
The visions say the scorpion was born as a centipede
That partnered with the succulents to poison their enemies
I tap in time like telegrams with telepathy
To share the bare necessities of all my discrepancies
Can't save my Macbook pages spillin' onto the melody
'Cause the margins 'round the pen
Couldn't keep up with my head again, uh
I kept that devil in my sights to never fall behind
That's how we always stay ahead, the flaw of my design
The higher that you climb, the more destructive your decline
I'm well aware that all this didn't have to quantify
So tell me if you really think it's unrealistic
Here at this point for me to not prepare and arm our district
They shouting, "Hands up," while they deploying their ballistics
We shouting, "Hands up," and kids who need it go ballistic
The difference in our League of Extraordinary Minorities
Against the identity, representing authority
Move between 'em accordingly, and clutch my rosaries
Before they try and send the lord for me, that's more for me
That's when the forerunners told me: "This is not your speed!"
While they repeated their beliefs from the Apostle's Creed
The most consistency I found in life has never come from people
Still looking for an equal, nobody will believe you

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
God ain't give me a penny, I made a million dollars
I got a thug for a father so I took care of my mother
God threw me in fire, I walked out with my brothers
You know the Shadow of Death?
I was born in the valley, but now I live in The Valley
God gave me a house, God gave me depression
God gave us life, but we ain't know it was cursed
I was hurt as a child, you know I still deal with it
Now I'm a grown-ass man with immature-ass feelings
All I wanted was money, just to get it and spend it
On strippers and weed, I ain't skip on the liquor
I can't talk to my niggas 'cause if I say it, it's real
And I ain't ready to face it, I've been flirtin' with Satan
I've been flirtin' with women that like to dance when they naked
And I throw all of my dollars, I throw all of my problems
To the back of my throat with weed smoke and klonopin
I'm ashamed of myself
About three days ago, I planned on killing myself
But I'm still here breathin', you know I'm still here screamin'
Screamin', "Fuck that shit", we signed for fifteen million
And I almost missed it, I know that y'all niggas hear me

[Outro: bearface]
We found a light
Will you still carry me?
When I fall
Let the hope and the joy
Rain down on me
Rain down on me (Ooh)
Raise me up
Carry, carry, carry me



[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I need it all downtown, nigga
Put it back where you fuckin' found it though
I need it all down (my nigga)
Keep 'em right there, oh, you found 'em though
I want a shirt that make my body feel all sexy
I want a chain that make my body feel all hefty
I want my head to fall off when I walk out the door
I want the rain to fall down and I'm askin' for more

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I want a love that make me feel like I ain't breakin' ya heart
I wanna know what made you stay
When it was wrong from the start
I need to know where you went lookin'
Where you went through the chart
I need this fear of being everybody else to depart
I got a lot on my mind, not enough hours to shed
Not enough trust to believe, not enough feelin' to care
I'm feeling numb to the world so I've been ignoring instead
I'm seeing through what I wanted, to recognize who is there, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Coming top down by the seaside
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
See the road sign on the 45
Only you and me by the borderline (ooh)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah, let it go

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
And I will show you off for everything I own
I know it's not what you're used to
See they could tear me down, take everything I made
I'll still be here next to you

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Coming top down by the seaside
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
See the wrong side of the 45
Only you and me by the borderline (ooo)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah (ooo-ooo)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah, let it go

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

Empty out my pockets
Floor of your apartment
How can we be honest if we're living check to check?
I see how hard you're trying to be the one providing
How can I be smilin' when I don't know what happens next?
Empty out my pockets
Floor of your apartment
How can we be honest if we're living check to check?
I see how hard you're trying to be the one providing
How can I be smilin' when I don't know what happens next?

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Big old whiskey on them icy rocks
Flood down some veins like oxy does
I need fresh air, I need oxygen
Who the hell you fooling? It's so obvious
I don't feel it, I don't see it, this is blasphemy
I can't help but feel like you is after me
Is you drinking for the pain? Is you drinking for fun?
There's a party outside, 'til the morning gon' come
Is you dancing all alone? Is you dancing for someone?
There's a party outside, know the night is young
Is you having fun?

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Say it with your chest, say it with your chest
Pray it work again
Putting diamonds on my back, putting diamonds on my back, yeah
Say it with your chest, say it with your chest
Pray it work again
Putting diamonds on my back, putting diamonds on my back, yeah

[Chorus: bearface]
But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I said, I said "Who that? Who that? Who that? Who that?"
Lurking in the shadows
Tryna catch me liberating spirits from the gallows
They wanna blackball me, but I held my avocados
Then they melt down like the hash we mix in our tobacco
Circle tighter than the Castro, they feeding you Castrol
You'd think that it's gas, you turn the key, it's a fiasco
Could be stronger than Vibranium, don't mean that I ain't fragile
Grapple with reality to break out of these shackles

[Chorus: bearface]
But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night

[Verse 3: Joba]
Suicidal thoughts, but I won't do it
Take that how you want, it's important I admit it
I'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it
Maybe codependent, can't tell the difference
When the push comes to shove, I'd rather bend than break
But something's gotta give, ain't that what they say
When you're torn between reality, and a choice you could have made
Or should've made, they're not the same, I'm not the same
Maybe I'm broken, either way I'm clinging on closely
I know it's unhealthy, appreciate your patience
I know that I'm selfish, do my best to be selfless
I know that I'm changing, I know that I'm changing

[Outro: London Community Gospel Choir]
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more



[Ameer Vann]
Stroke my ego
My white bitch got a black ass
I love white people
I know they got me brainwashed
I was watchin' Baywatch
Mommy with the colored people
Then she lost her day job

[Kevin Abstract]
Man, ever since I came to California
I felt so lonely even though I-

[Matt Champion]
No, I really don't remember what your name is
And that's really not me actin' famous

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Everybody wanna be a star (okay)
Everybody wanna be real (for sure)
All I wanted was to be a king (okay)
Give the people something they can feel (for sure)
I don't really got a lot of time (okay)
Got a lot of birds I need to kill (for sure)
Not enough stones in my hand (okay)
That's because I like what's in the deal
So I gotta deal with it, accordingly
Stars aligning my hands now
You create your own reality
Just gotta understand the circumstances now
I roll a leaf around a couple grams
Yeah I know I ain't perfect but I gotta plan now
I like to roll around in my problems before I burn 'em down
Burn 'em down
So don't judge me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them

Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
All I ever wanted was a dad (okay)
All I ever wanted was a slab (for sure)
All I ever wanted was some grills (okay)
All I ever wanted was a bitch (for sure)
All I ever wanted was respect (okay)
All I ever wanted was a gun (for sure)
All I ever wanted was some BAPE (okay)
All I ever wanted was some braids
All I ever wanted was the fame
All I ever wanted was a sidekick
All I ever wanted was some wealth
All I ever wanted was a Pocket Rocket
All I ever wanted was Rihanna
All I ever wanted was a MySpace
All I ever wanted was a MacBook
All I ever wanted was a family

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them

Things I never had
Made me who I am
These things I never had
Made me who I am
I hate myself
Said I hate myself
The things I never had
Made me who I am
These things I never had
Made me who I am
Things I never had
These things I never had
Made me who I am[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
Martin Luther movement back, I just bought a Cadillac
I ain't put no rims on it, niggas don't know how to act
"Where the fuck you get this cash?"
Questions that my momma ask
Woke up naked on the beach, pretty bitch in the sand
Take a pic in the sand, point and shoot in the head
None of these hit the brand, throw all the work in the can

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
And when I was a young one, I walked with a headphone
When I was a young one, they wouldn't let me have one
They said "you no can none", said "you no respect none"
But I do that, ride like an idiot
You can never see me, y'all dumb piglets
I got a feeling, somethin' in your stomach
Your ten toes, bendin' shit like I'm on it
Got my hundreds wrapped up tighter
Than your ass, in them tighty-wities
I got me, like it, I got what I like it
I get what I like it, uh, uh
Bruh, but I get it, I like it, yo
I got this, yeah, I got this
I look at you, I got this, yo, I got this
I look at you, I got this, I got this
LMAO, I split your legs like some fuckin' mayo
I call your daddy and your momma and run in they home
'Cause I'm a asshole, I'm a wild ass nig', you know
'Cause I ain't really get no attention when I was younger
I don't, ugh, all I ever had was the hunger
And a need for the money
It's late in the night, I had munchies
It don't stop, man, it fuckin' not stoppin'
When the flow choppin, when the beat drop
I can feel the floor drop, I can feel the ceiling rise
I can feel myself high, yeah, and the girls say "Hi"
So please tell me why, that I drop this new, man
All these hits in 5:57
When I'm feelin' fly in a 747
Yeah, I think it's just me and my brethren[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I'm not a hypocrite, I'm human
I make mistakes to make sure I never repeat 'em
Inhaler help me breathe in South Central hot
Smoke like a chimney, I hope I don't get got
And I ain't had no pussy in two months
I been busy man, I been working man
And I ain't called my mom in three days
I hope she miss me, man
I know she love me, man
All these feelings bottled up about to set me off
And most is extra meat that lingering get cut off
Yeah we've been making money, yeah we've been making guap
While you've been walking in the meeting's 'bout to suck some
Dick
I left my bitch in Malibu
I left my smokes up on the roof
So don't forget who you're talking to
If I bring it in existence it gon' come true

[Chorus: bearface]
The matter's over-complicated, oh
But I'm never overcompensating, ooh
Spinning around makes it harder to pave my way
Resting my prize will make me end our love either way
[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I know I make mistakes, I try to not repeat 'em
But I'm still working on it, negotiate with demons
I stop fucking girls the first time I meet 'em
And I don't talk to strangers about my new arrangements
I got big dreams of selling out arenas
They comin' out to see me, white folks in the meetings
And they smiling at me, but I'm the same nigga
Point them hoses at me, send the dogs for me

[Chorus: bearface]
The matter's over-complicated, oh
But I'm never overcompensating, ooh
Spinning around makes it harder to pave my way
Resting my prize will make me end our love either way

[Outro: JOBA]
I don't got much money
But I'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright
I don't got much money
But I'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright

A loser, a rental
A dentist, I been to
And take a lose from me and I'll be out it, out it
Tryna make y' smile, wanna make out

Fucked a loser, in his rental
A dentist, I been to

You got freckles on your lip, lip, lip
They might give you cancer, shit, shit, shit
Wring your wrist and take a swish, swish, swish
Big hole, flushin' out the script, script, script
Backwoods, blowin' off a zip, zip, zip
So we still spit the belt, ain't no heaven on a hell
Brush your hair so I see your-

I don't wanna be sober
So I can lie to my lovers
Got sad and said I loved her
I was high, I ain't mean it
I ain't lyin', I got problems
I'll leave for no reason
Make love with no feelings
I be your nigga for the evening

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
In between the bridges filled with kerosene
Are words we never said, turned into a routine
My feelings still remain unseen
Can't intervene with anything that's on the screen
When life is playin', they play games and expect me to pick a team
I can't win, I can't breathe, everything ain't what it seems
I played my case and then erase my underlying self-esteem
I know it's awful for my health, I know it all becomes extreme
I can't redeem from this regime that's invaded all of my dreams
From the asphalt to the steam, we found a theme then made a scene
At the moment that the guillotine was the only vaccine don't intervene
Shit ain't been the same since I was 17
Fuckin' up is in my genes, I think I need a quarantine, yeah

[Outro: Joba]
Chain-smoking, got twenty things on my mind (Yeah)
Fake feelings, when I hit it from behind (Yeah)
Consenting to my heart's demise (Oh)
I fall in love and fall in line (Oh)
Tip toe-in' in tap shoes when you're sleepin' in the corner (Shh)
Leave before I fall in love with you, I'm a self-proclaimed loner (Shh)
A novice with a master plan (Yes I am)
Genuine but fraudulent (Yes I am)



[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Los Angeles is dangerous
Them things they bust try cancel us
Los Angeles is dangerous
Them things they bust try cancel us
Los Angeles is dangerous
Them things they bust try cancel us
Los Angeles is dangerous
Them things they bust try cancel us

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I've been on some other shit, ducking under covers
I've been running from the government, racist white Republicans
Now I'm out in California, Prius full of vegans
Always late to meetings with rich white people
Fuck these rich white people, stroke my ego
My white bitch got a black ass, I love white people
I know they got me brainwashed, I was watching Baywatch
"Mommy, where the colored people?" Then she lost her day job
We was watching Jamie Foxx, I'ma move to LA
I'ma get my money up, I'ma be a famous rapper
Only got a hundred bucks, daddy let me take his truck
In this truck, I had a mic, I had my niggas set it up
Arrive on 37th street, think my past just set me up
Niggas throwing sets up, but that shit don't upset us
Had to quit my day job, I would work security
Lyrics on my cellphone, protecting a community
You don't see how clear it be? The angel right in front of me
Came to me inside a dream, told me to grab on her wings
Camera lens up on my face, tell your boy to stay in place
Reason why I love my state, let's see if the ward agree
Ever since I came to LA
Ever since I came to LA
Ever since I came to LA
Ever since I came to LA

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Running through Elysium, I done died a hundred times
Demons took the high beams, I'm trying to adjust my eyes
Smuggled in an angel past the borders of my broken mind
All the other angels on the bridge committing suicide
Lucifer is petrified, everybody lost faith
Sky turned into fire before I could find a prom date
When we hit the streets, they couldn't calculate the crime rate
Acid in the fireplace, Haley's for the holidays
I could tell you all the horror stories of my past life
I been having visions where I'm sipping on my last light
Poisoning the palace from the chalice of my past wife
Murdered by my confidence that closes you to last night
Swerving past the lava, hope I make it to get baptized

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Man, ever since I came to California
I've felt so lonely even though I stay with homies
But damn, I can't wait to get out California
Floating by my lonely with some money just to hold me

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I don't trust nobody on the west coast
Turn me to an asshole
Wanna bring my phone, turn into a ghost
Guess I'm just an asshole
People walking in and out the house like, "Who is you?"
Man, who you is? Man, who is this?
You ain't even introduce yourself
You gon' step inside my house with your shoes on?
And it's raining, and I'm pissed off
No, I really don't remember what your name is
And that's really not me acting famous
'Cause I'm not famous, bad memory
"South Central, man, isn't that a bad place?
'There were riots in the '90s, you might die' place"
Now this 'hundred in the summer, sink or swim' place
This the 'world's best tacos on the corner' place
This the 'they will hold you down if you respect' place
So don't get comfortable, 'cause really, this ain't my place
Been to SoHo, been to [?], been to one-oh
That's some fake industry, but it's fun, though
Smoking on the patio with my hood up
Out of place, ask the bar for some smokes, man
Did you know? Did you see? There's a dress code
Scott Disick saying, "Who the hell are we, man?"
Shit, guess he just an asshole like me, damn

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Man, ever since I came to California
I've felt so lonely even though I stay with homies
But damn, I can't wait to get out California
Floating by my lonely with some money just to hold me
Man, ever since I came to California
I've felt so lonely even though I stay with homies
But damn, I can't wait to get out California
Floating by my lonely with some money just to hold me
Man, ever since I came to California
I've felt so lonely even though I stay with homies
But damn, I can't wait to get out California
Floating by my lonely with some money just to hold me
Man, ever since I came to California
I've felt so lonely even though I stay with homies
But damn, I can't wait to get out California
Floating by my lonely with some money just to hold me

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I'm a felon, watch me film it
Bad baby, watermelon in her denim
Like the brother from Miami
White powder, tell his bros, know I'm 'bouta
Tell them I was ready, right now I be ready (boy got it!)
Take a head, put it through the public housing (break my body)
Pay for it with my own tax dollars (I don't want it)
Pay for killing brothers been (Merlyn Merlyn)

[Hook: Matt Champion]
Boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'ma keep my distance from the cowards
I done put in twenty thousand hours
I don't want your co-sign for the hour
Everything is sweet while niggas sour
They don't know about a nigga's story
They could love me in the moment, in the future they'll ignore me
What ya doin' for me, huh?
I don't think them niggas seem to recognize
Cutting through the crap like I got pesticides, weaponize
[Verse 3: Joba]
What have I told you? I know who I am
(You can't tell me shit)
People are pointing their fingers at me
(I'm not the one to play with)
White flags, fly so free
(You can't tell me shit)
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down for me
(I'm not one to play with)
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down for me

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I always pay in cash, so I ain't got no credit
I'ma need a co-signer if you're tryna get it
Moved up out the house, close my bank account
They couldn't fill my check, I need to buy a jet
I ain't been the same since Viceland paid
See me on the screen, my million dollar face
My momma told me I was gonna be a star, yeah
I paid the debt and then I went a bought a car, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks (Help me out now)
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I'll never be who you want me to be
Wear my own pants, should've probably popped the seat
Made my own clothes, I don't need no receipt
'Less it's Holiday on me like I'm Jesus [?]
A lotta you niggas try to be like me
But jack it all you want, 'cause nigga this the OG
Done with the teenage shit too
I'm just a cute ass nigga with a gaptooth
Niggas online always got a fuckin' attitude
I've been the weird one ever since the classroom
And y'all be wonderin' why I'm actin' crazy now
They call me corny but I'm thinkin' that we're idols now
I'm eatin' fast food yellin' this what life about
Nigga took the harder route, ended up with less friends
They took the faster route, ended up with no ends
I'm like Wayne in '04, this where my story begins
And this that-

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks (Help me out now)
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Bet you're only talkin' to me for a benefit
If you get around me you wouldn't ask me if
Is my mental, is my dental, is my health good?
When they're crashin' through my cars, see me on the hood
Better get insurance, when the tire burns
Break the mirror on the side, man, that's 7 years
Of fuckin' bad luck, want to see me to suffer
Walkin' under ladders [?]
Not too superstitious, rather build a business
Not to worry 'bout the petty shit in your britches
Color coordinated, give a fuck about the gossip
[?] let me make it on my own
Who the [?], who the [?], who let the birds chirp
[?] then we hit the curb
Riding on the front lawn, anybody doubt me?
That's some teachers, that's some people
Not too good with names, you see

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks (Help me out now)
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Get up off your ass
Know I gotta have some, gotta get my ransom
Babblin', babblin', babblin'
Whats's all this babblin', this time I would've had 'em man
Have fun, and I said I would travel, man
Should've not, [?] travelin'
[?]
[?]
When I failed seventh grade [?]
I mean Ghana, I mean
Fuck any nationality tryna perfect me

[Bridge: Joba]
You better watch your mouth 'cause that shit spew out
When you talk about what I'm worth
Y'all talk, talk (Everybody wanna talk that shit)
Y'all talk, talk (Everybody wanna talk that shit)
You better watch your mouth 'cause that shit spew out
When you talk about what I'm worth
Y'all talk, talk (Everybody wanna talk that shit)
Y'all talk, talk (Everybody wanna talk that shit)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks (Help me out now)
See, that's the reason I don't like to talk
Niggas think they haters 'til they hit the wall
I'll be in this van 'til the early morn'
I don't want a friend I want a million bucks

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
God as my witness, I ain't sadistic
I'm just a soul that's been tortured beyond it's limits
Feel like an idiot, feel like a misfit
A fallen angel that's lost it's chance at repentance
Ain't no forgiveness for how I ran up them digits
I'm too colorful, wonderful, ambitious
See bein' me ain't easy, it's sacrilegious
I need assistance to maximize my existence
Gratification [?], gratitude non-existent
[?] just servin' between the ridges
I've been up 'till [?]
Burned all my bridges
Death in the distance, killed all the princes
Draped a fine linen, fell out the sky
The Earth in my image, now I can fly
See, legends can't die, we too altruistic
Y'all [?] fake tears, so hop off my business

[Verse 5: Ameer Vann]
I sell it by the gram, money loves my hands
I pull a few bands out a plastic bag
And it all add up, I'm real good with the math
I turn a quarter of gas into a bundle of cash
They always come back for what I put in the bag
From my bones to my skin, I'm a businessman
I know cash is the law, you could lose your head
Get shot in the back and you could lose your legs
Niggas sing for the feds to avoid the pen
They atone for sins, I don't trust no men
Cops raid my house off some shit you said
Niggas strapped with mics, they'll take your life



[Verse: Joba]
I chainsmoke 'til I choke
Have a good heart but bad health
You would never know
Where can you turn at the end of a road
Let myself go, I know I'm at fault
'Cause I'm not who I thought at all
Smokescreens in the dark
I just drink and drive
The freeway eases my mind and I can cry on my own
Going 95, no one on the passenger's side
But the person in the rear view's telling lies
You could end it all if you'd like to
And you can drink a fifth and, uh
Drive to, um, wherever you'd like to
'Cause, well, nobody likes you
And nobody feels like you do
Plus, nobody understands the weight of the
Broken heart that you feel, so fuck it
You might as well just get real high and stupid
Rent a motel room and drink away your issues
It could be so simple, nobody wants to help you
They laugh and smile because you're different, you know
It's all your fault but you stay well-tempered
You've always had your wits about you
You hide away, so mental
And I'm glad you stay reclusive
You have a wound that's self-inflicted
And in times like this it's too late to fix it
The weight of the world couldn't change you
But if you died, no one would miss you
So here's to another night alone with all your fears
And all your demons, your deepest darkest secrets
The shit that keeps you from sleeping
It's better when you don't think about it
But you don't have the power, 'cause I'm your master
Speed up and surrender, this time is different
So indecisive, no wonder why she left you
One of the many reasons why you'd like to
Put a bullet in your head or veer left off the highway
You're walking a tightrope at your lowest
Now you're hopeful, but that'll change when the night falls
You're a waste of a lifeform
You should do what you couldn't do this time last year
You can hope and pray all you want but nobody cares
Death waits for the time comes, and the time's come
Shut me up if you'd like to
But you're a coward and you know it's true
I'll be here if you need me, up to you

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
That's okay and I don't mind
I think you're kind of perfect
You blend in with the guys
And that's okay and I don't mind
I think you're kind of perfect
You blend in with the guys

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Around you, around you, around you, around you
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Around you, around you, around you
Sometimes I

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
MERLYN!
Bet she flicking like Tiger the tee
And she make her wanna hold onto me
And she wanna rip my tee
And she wanna do hunting
Ain't see nothing, I don't do no fret
I don't do no, no Skyping thing
I don't do no, no testing thing
I don't do no best friending--
MERLYN!

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I hold my hands above everything
I fuck the world up, a wedding ring
I hold the mic like I'm Heather B
I hold the mic up, let the world let me
See all the things that I want to see
One-two-three, right in front of me
Back in the day when my sister let me watch MTV before I sleep

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I don't see opposition near
Shoot the frame like I'm Lars von Trier
Won't succumb or run from my fears
For the Melancholia from my peers
Cloud above my head, hide my tears
Hydroplane while I'm shifting gears
Loop-de-loop down Mulholland Drive
Hope I land in a newer life
On a new star, on a new pitch
In a new world with a new whip
Hit light speed when I tap that gas
I won't hide from what's in my past
I don't need you lames in my life
Don't need fame to go shine my light
Bigger picture ain't in your sight
Imma paint a vision, IMAX tonight

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I paid for fame, I should've kept my receipts
Sold my soul for a handful of weed
Still got holes in my hands and my feet
I turn pain into Sprite with the lean
Mark of the beast
Real big dog need a bone and a leash
I see demons when I'm fallin' asleep
Shadows leaving like they following me
Sold out show, but I'm still alone
Dress my best when I feel depressed
So I ain't taking no shit tonight
Quarter ounce of that kryptonite
Burn it down and I feel alright
I can't seem to outrun my problems
I get high and I never solve 'em
Roll it up and I burn my sorrow
[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
La la la la, la la la, la la la

La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la

[Verse 5: Matt Champion]
Front seat, back seat, also in shotgun
Bangin' on the door like we gon' fuck it all up
All these living means they ain't fuckin' with me
Bet you thought babygirl had me down to a T
Take one to the drug spot, one to the bank
One to the summer till ya see what y'all think
Six feet under block, opp need a angel (angel)
Bean bags under my eyes like a zombie (zombie)
Someone lift the top like a purple badge (woo woo)
Weird eye color make ya bug out
When I scroll through, little me in my head, voodoo
Goo goo goo joob, early birdie get the Beatle
Fuck it up, let the meter run (meter run, meter run)
Life's short, have a little fun (little fun, little fun)
I don't give a fuck about you, yes, I gotta run
Need a smoke, damn, black lung

Arrive at your front door, I came high, fo' sho'
Is this what you want to be? Is this what you want to be? (fo' sho')
Tell me what you wanna be, tell me who you gonna be (Cool)
Back and forth, no, I can't lie

You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Bag it up, I keep trapping
Used to not afford no dollar menu, now I be Big Mac, kid
Getting kicked out of PAX, that's a past tense now
When I'm in that bitch, they polite as a pastor
Bag it up, on the road
Time to go back to war
All the things that I said I'd do, I went and did
All my fault, on my own but, kid, I said that shit
Bag it up, on the road
Time to go, every day, do the things that I say
Bag it up, on the road
Gotta go, every day, do the things that I say

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
My biggest issue is I can't have a kid
Okay, I'm lying, got some other fucking issues, bitch
I always wonder what that's like on the other side
Guess I'll get to see it whenever my mother dies
I'm sorry mom for making songs about the shit you done
You been the greatest, no excuse for a shitty son
Moved to progressive Californ-I-A, I switched up
I was raised where some niggas gettin' lynched up
If you ain't playin' ball or throwin' sets up
Was getting jumped on for trying to play dress-up
I'm tired of seeing niggas that I hate copy me
I'm tired of homophobic niggas that follow me
They're probably same type of niggas that'll swallow me
I know you think that shit was weak but that was tongue-in-cheek
Put the tongue to the cheek, pose for the pic
You all look the same, niggas getting desperate
You want some fucking love?
You want some Instagram likes? You're posted in the club
I'm in the hotel room on tour, man
Set the stu' up everywhere I go man
I liked Wayne when I was in the fucking sixth grade
That's why Ashlan keep the camera on me all day
A young Spike Jonze, movies on my iPhone
This music shit is cool, wait to see what
(I got more, I got more, keep it rolling, keep it rolling)
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me

You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Made me wanna kill me, skin like armadillo
America the new Sodom, feel it in my blood
Let the gold drape my neck, let the silver grip my knuckles
When they ask you who shot 'em
Nobody doing jail time, nobody paying consequence
Silence when it rest, words murder all the time
Now this shit offset, now my bitch upset
Yeah, I creep upstream
I'ma bury till they send me, I'm a gun to the human
I'm a psychopath
I'm a menace, man, with no dentist plan after 27
Offset, offset, I'm a scape rat (scape rat)
I'm a mallrat with that palm sweat on my white tee (white tee)
I'm like sight, see on my CC (yo, CEO)
I need us, I need love, I need hope (ahh)
To keep me going
I need to keep them doors open
I ain't talk unless the cash there
With denim and cashmere
Crib in Japan, sushi in my hand
Recording everything, bang on the thing
Black everything

I don't wanna seem too blunt
But I can't get behind this bullshit
I mean everything you do is a nuisance
And you say you wanna ride with the shooters?
If that's true, forgive me if I'm wrong
But I'ma bet my life on it, you don't even own a gun
Wave hi as I stand outside (hi!) with my short-shorts on
You sneak a picture, there's a shoobie on yo front lawn
Hit you on the head with my flip-flop, I spin in the air like I did that
Gotta layin' low 'til I flip out, I'm a bit imbalanced, I know
20/20 vision, I'm watching, you built a career off of problems
You ain't ever deal with this toxic, you should be ashamed
I see right through the facade, you must think everyone's blind
I don't play into the lies, just thought you should know

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em

Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You ain't shit to me
I'll break a nigga head before I leave
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap
You ain't shit to me
I'll break a nigga head before I leave
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap
You ain't shit to me
I'll break a nigga head before I leave
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap

[Verse: Merlyn Wood]
Coming from a hard place, I'm a resident
What they do right, had my life with embellishment
Representing shit my Instagram I always say
Talking reckless, my brain spin faster than that shit

[Outro]
Find me useless

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Real life, man, wonder what it feel like
Whole life spent livin' someone else life
What life like if I was born
It's Mark Wahlberg in the desert storm
Got a record deal with some braces on me
We a boy band, face it homie
And these boys all chasin' homie
I'm tryna make a dozen films

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I'm makin' peace with all my demons 'fore I clock out
It never comes as we perceive it 'til we drop out
I'm too big to burn a bridge that I should stomp out
I got a vision, I ain't quittin' 'til I'm crossed out
And even then, I still be screamin' from the nosebleeds
To let 'em know I never let the pressure know me
You couldn't even hold a candle to the old me
So what I look like letting you try to control me
I'm on a mission to reclaim the times that broke me
The life I took is not the one that fuckin' chose me
And I ain't goin' back, I'm ridin' in the sunset
I'm pacin' between self-awareness and civil unrest
Oh, everything I sign with every label seems to suggest
My fate is pre-determined, I'm for certain that's my success

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I got everything I want and I want somethin' else
I try to fill the void and pull the Bible off the shelf
Ashes on my sheets, I find it hard to sleep
I got little problems, I know y'all sick of hearin'
I think I'm missin' somethin' but I can't think of nothin'
(That's true)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Real life, man, wonder what it feel like
Whole life has been livin' someone else life
What life like if I was born
It's Mark Wahlberg in the desert storm
Got a record deal with some braces on me
We a boy band, face it homie
And these boys all chasin' homie
I'm tryna make a dozen films

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
In the back, in the back
Make it to Jerusalem with my fam in the back
In the back, in the back
The haters still infragrant but that payback is exact
House packed to the max
Niggas in the kitchen, niggas in the back
Nothing in my fridge but my hunger is in that
Niggas havin' visions, layin' they own tracks
Shit been south central, niggas in the back
In the back
When I make it I'ma

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
I would do it in the dungeon, no barely function
I would do it in the dungeon, just barely function, picking sh-
I would do it from the dungeon, could barely function
Pickin' strawberry with my aunty, with the answers
With the long sleeves, upper ground pool in the backyard
With the bare pull, with the bad luck
Shouldn't wait on me, takes a while 'fore that bed, homie
Dead homies

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Merlyn Wood]
I'll keep it locked in my pocket for ya
We so tired, when the sun gon' show up?
(Yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
(Yeah, yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
I'll keep it locked in my pocket for ya
We so tired, when the sun gon' show up?
(Yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
(Yeah, yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
Hi, guys! Come to the southside
Where niggas pop them fireworks when they drive by
The helicopters, they fly over, I wave "hi"
The men in red throw gang signs when I skate by
I walk the line between South Central and Van Nuys
A nice house, a quiet life, and clear skies
No butterflies on the southside of the city
All my niggas is with me
This is just the beginning

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'm absentminded, intelligent, with too many thoughts
Personify 'em in voices whenever I'm distraught
Who's making choices inside of me when I'm feeling lost?
They say I made it, don't ever imagine it's the cost
On autopilot whenever I have to operate
Within constraints of society when it concentrates
I'm separating inside of myself and contemplate
I don't cooperate, fuck how you congregate
[Verse 3: JOBA]
Oh, were those gunshots or fireworks? Still can't tell the difference
I got press, street cred nonexistent
I was paranoid, my bank account was empty
Spent the money that I had on ice cream
I wore a sport coat to feel like a rich man
And like the fake wood on the floor, I watch the cars peel off
Poppin' bullets, I was sweatin' bullets, mind my business
Had no air conditioning, didn't have a lot of shit I wanted
I had a microphone and 20 dumbasses wanting to hop on
The microphone, so I just record 'em all
And then we made some songs that got real big and all
Just kidding, they kinda did, but not really, sort of
Um, we got out the hood
Bye!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Merlyn Wood]
I'll keep it locked in my pocket for ya
We so tired, when the sun gon' show up?
(Yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
(Yeah, yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
I'll keep it locked in my pocket for ya
We so tired, when the sun gon' show up?
(Yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
(Yeah, yeah!) Fireworks make me feel alive in the morning
[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I used to hate going to school, mama said it's cool
But they still [?] to rippin' me out my seatbelt (Ooh)
I eat lunch with the counselors, should I bring a friend?
Play Connect Four, eat nuggets shaped like some dinosaurs
I had a crush on Maddie (aww) 'til she threw up on her TAKS test
Get assigned a caste and [?]
I wanna be pro baller 'til I saw Baker 3
That's a free-livin', piss-drunk, feelin' billy goat curse
Cuz-lovin', eye bag-havin', take a nap-ass
But actin' like a air bag beacon, don't speak about the trip
On the [?], on the weekend, Even Steven bleedin' reruns, TV glisten
Shut up! Shut up![Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Blah, blah, blah, same shit every song
What kind of drugs Ameer on?
What kind of boys you fucking on?
It's like the same damn sh-fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
My life on display, I'm always live streamin', always tweetin'
Always doin' some shit that's gon' get me in trouble
It's McDoubles and a Sprite, every night
I used to live a boring life in a suburban cold town, I'm cold now
My family used to think I was useless and clueless
Really I had visions same way that fuckin' Snoop did, shit
Should've never grew up 'cause I found out Santa Claus was fake
And because I realized that I haven't told my family that I'm-
Blah, blah, blah, same shit every song
What kind of drugs Ameer on?
What kind of boys you fuckin' on?
It's like the same damn shit every time I log on
It's a new lame nigga that wanna see us fail
Well we always to the future, I'ma always do it well
I met these niggas when I was 12 and Lord knows, I've seen hell
Probably shouldn't fuckin' be here, sorry to my fuckin' past life
Searching for my dad's ghost even though that man alive
[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
I done dodged a bullet when they caught me with an empty bag
Sixteen, rockin' the system inside my mom's van
Woulda took this shit to Kentucky fast if I had the chance
I put myself before a lot of people and I get nothing back
How y'all always know what I'm thinking, I guess you got me pinned
I bet they know me so well they could draw my fingerprints
See I'ma stay in the sky, I'm like an idle jet
And I ain't worth shit as well, I know I got regrets
My baby bad got me beatin' just like some cardio
I hit the gas on the caddy and then I adios
Fuck you, fuck y'all, and y'all way back there
I don't like nobody hang around here
Two-faced so they face just to say they been there
I ain't no better, I'm a fuckin' prick
I stay my ass in the house and I ain't left for days
Maybe I should run away and lay away until I'm all okay

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
How many firetrucks can I count?
They drive real fast past my house
How many firetrucks can I count?
They drive real fast pass my house

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Probably gon' shoot me if they see me
Now I'm on your TV, looking for a genie
Told him I was genius, I don't do bleeding
I need another season, they ain't seeing what I'm seeing, no?
You might never wan' be me, no?
Even when my skin greasy, no?
McDonalds would've been the more fire option
The barely famous shit is getting really fucking toxic
I used to wanna be Ali, I tried to be a boxer
Until you told me I could sing just like Mariah
And started-right?

[Outro]
Ooooh-stop

[Verse 1 - Kevin Abstract]
All-American self-hatred runs deep
White boys all I see whenever I sleep
[?] a purpose
But I knew [?] before cash ruin me
[?] masters and slaves
These mobs hate niggas, they like niggas that sing
[?] I tried to gang-bang
I tried to get laid, I had to get paid
Ride on this shit [?]
[?] I cap my own streak
Running this shit like its a track meet
I had to get back [?] seen too many [?]
[?], real nigga tell
With the little toys, nigga look, you told me to fail
You are now tuned in [?]
New machine, keep the beats, keep 'em dancing

[Hook]
Don't shoot up the party, don't shoot up the party, please
Don't shoot up the party, don't shoot up the party, please
Don't shoot up the party, don't shoot up my-

[Part 1: SISTER]

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Drink of the apple pie with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't got no chains in my denim, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't listen what the blogs tell me, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know niggas got their own agenda, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Joba]
I've got [censored], but you would never know
I like to hide them, so much I lose myself
That's why I'm pure to some, a psychopath to others
And grew up in counseling, flipping off my counselors
They gave me mood stabilizers
But when I came off 'em, I was violent
Took the drugs that I wanted, which didn't help with the voices
They just grew louder and louder
Like all the people who'd just chatter and chatter
I juggle all my personalities

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I found myself getting better by the fucking minute
'Member when my momma always had to save the minutes
Got some D's, dropped out, wanted to be Russell Simmons
Gotta keep workin', my head on Innervisions
Where the kitchen at? Keep the lyrics written
Raid my cell and dope, askin' for forgiveness
I just ran into somebody sellin' lemonade
Kiss your kids tonight before them bitches run away

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
This for all my broke niggas, this for all them jokes, nigga
That you niggas made when I was still livin' at home, nigga
Did it on my own, nigga, grew up and I bossed out
Grew up and I bossed out, grew up and I bossed out

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I see you peekin' through bushes
And tryna get secret ingredients from us
I know that you do it 'cause you see us boomin'
Like C4 when you hit that detonator
Lucky-lucky on the elevator
Eat my dust, baby, I'll see ya later
I could always call your bluff
You already said enough
Take a risk, bitch
Still sittin' on your ass, waitin' for a handout
Giving nothin', put your hands down
"Ooh, yeah, this for the culture!"
"Ooh, yeah, this important!"
Fuck off with that slang shit
Fuck off with that networking
Keep your mouth where the money at

[Bridge: Dom McLennon]
Yellow lights on my dashboard
Red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset
But all I wanna do is see you
You know that lately I don't think straight
But I don't really know what I'm doing now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up
I'm struggling while on the move now
Yellow lights on my dashboard
Red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset
But all I wanna do is heal you
You know that lately I don't think straight
But lately I don't know what to do now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up
I'm struggling while on the move now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred  bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

[Part 2: NATION]

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Barely got control of it, must've got a hold of it
Threw me to the ground and left a scar right on my nigga-lips
I look in my closet when I think about the past life
Never good in my wallet, tryna see if I got my cash right
Fuck a flight, they ain't never wanna treat my bag right
Fuck a job, they ain't never treat my mom and dad right

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I hate them quiet suburbs, I hate those picket fences
I hate the separation, first thing they called me; "Nigga"
I fight, I got suspended, my teachers saw me hit him
So they ain't listen to me, and from that moment on
I would learn that I was different, I would grow to see the difference
Second-guessing my decisions, Black bodies come up missing

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I would walk through the halls at my own pace
Every lunch, I would flow, having no place
All the books in my bag 'til my bones ache
Wonder how the world would be if I had no face
If I had no heart, if I had no skin
And I was just thoughts, reminiscing
The things I always brushed off
Had my father try to tell me I was just soft
And when I look at the things that I've been through
And the things I survived, and at what cost?
All the love in my life that I just lost
All this shit persevere to the pole vault
In the lies of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes of my own, I ain't start yet
In the eyes of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes that I own, I ain't start yet, I ain't start yet

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Power, African power!
Power, African power!
Power, African power!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
Ugh, I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Shoot 'em dead, split the wishbone
Bad luck, spilled the weed on the carpet
No more babysitting, no more homework
No more van rides to the mountains with the GameCube taped up
Take the auto down the block
With the scratches on the door, CD, no aux
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Where do I go when I die? What if I spend my whole life
Being a bad-ass boy with a crate on the side
I keep my face in my lap, wanna sit in the back
My mom driving around, we got church in an hour
Where do I go when I die? What if I spend my whole life
Being a bad-ass boy with a crate on the side
I keep my face in my lap, when I sit in the back
My mom driving around, we got church in an hour

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood and Kevin Abstract]
On sight, when I pull up to the light (Ayy, nigga)
My bike sound like Skype (woo-woo)
I don't write, I just pull it out the sky (Ayy, nigga)
I was there for attendance then I died
On sight, when I pull up to the light (Skrr!)
My bike sound like skype (woo-woo)
I don't write, I just pull it out the sky (Ayy, nigga)
I was there for attendance then I died

[Interlude: Joba and Ryan Beatty]

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Something about him
His car ain't nice and flashy (Yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
Yeah, his attitude is like magic (Yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
I know I got to have it
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
I really like how you do all the things that you do
I really like how you say all the things that you say (I love him!)
I really like how you do all the things you could do
I really like all the things that you really could say, ayy
I really like how you move when you're out by yourself
I really like all your crew and you can take 'em to hell
Boy, don't you know I fucking got you? Right, right

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
There's something about him
His car ain't nice and flashy (Yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
Yeah, his attitude is like magic (Yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
I know I got to have it
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I love him, I love him
Something about him

Lyrics from Snippet

[Ryan Beatty]
Feels like there's somethin' between us
Looks like there's somethin' I dreamed of
When I explain what I'm feelin'
Nobody, nobody understands
Nobody, nobody understands
Nobody, nobody understands
Nobody, nobody understands

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
If you want me by your side, by your side, then I'm ridin' with you
Baby, I'm ridin', yeah-yeah, baby
If you let me spend that night then I'm down to sit in silence with you
Down to sit in silence, down to sit in silence
If you want me by your side, by your side, then I'm ridin' with you
Baby, I'm ridin', yeah-yeah, baby
If you let me spend that night then I'm down to sit in silence with you
Down to sit in silence, down to sit in silence

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Yeah, it's you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it's you (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
Yeah, it's you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it's you (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
You-you, you-you
Yeah...



[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I spent like a year and a half on the Greyhound bus
On the way to see this girl
Take a flight back just to keep my job
Used to fly standby, late to the airport
Where the buddy pass? Stuck in the traffic
Whole lotta hours, real long distance
But I've grown since then
Learned to be on my own since then
Marble floor in my brand new crib
This the life that I wanted still
Got a hole and it burn my chest
Mash the chip that's still in my shoulder
Ain't a day that I still been sober
These the things that I'm tripping over

[Interlude: Ashlan Grey]
Y'all motherfuckers made three albums
Still talking about the same shit
The one gay, the one selling drugs
The one that's tryna act like Lil Wayne
What the fuck is this shit man?
Y'all better turn this shit off when y'all get in the whip
When y'all enter my whip, y'all better not play this shit
'Cause this can go right the fuck off

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Now them boys hooked on heroin
Parents always asking like, "Where y'all get it from?"
Rehab poppin' like when Amy had the single out
Single out the reasons how I quit before I fell down
I used to pick Ameer up
Talk about what's got us fucked up
We vent 'til the sun up, ay
Hopefully get our funds up, ay
And if I didn't know y'all
Maybe I would have a desk job
Ticking 'til I off myself...

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Used to drive around for some hours (Oh-oh)
Used to get paid by the hour (Oh-oh)
Now I'm just pickin up my check (Oh-oh)
Now I'm just pickin up a sweat (Yeah)
Used to drive around for some hours (Oh-oh)
Circle round the block for some hours (Oh-oh)
Now I'm just pickin up my check (Oh-oh)
Now I'm just pickin up a sweat (Yeah)

[Chorus: Joba]
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I spent like a year and a half feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I thought love ain't make sense anymore
If I drank, you would probably see a fifth on the floor
And a hole in the door, rest a few more
Scared of the past I've been tryna avoid
From before I was born
Running from the shoes that my grandfathers wore
Tryna pick a better battle I saw on the wharf
Feel the sun in my pores but I still got clouds in my head, now
Rain for a little bit, stay for a little bit
Moved along with my head, down
That's what momma taught me and I never let them fuck me
When they handed me a dead king's crown
Told 'em think of what you doing before I'm the one you're choosing
I just wanna be a human when I share myself
Hear the things I'm saying and I scare myself, goddamn

[Chorus: Joba]
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute (Ooh), I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it baby
Be there any minute (Ooh), I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I might go Interstellar
I feel like Matthew McConaughey
I don't care for what they gotta say
Tony Perkis how I drop the weight
Jason Bourne with the headshot
Jason Statham with the whip game
Liam Neeson with the rescue
I go Gunnar with the leather face
Bruce Campbell with the chains
Tobin Bell with the saw
Anthony Hopkins, I'm eatin' 'em raw
They don't know who we are
Molly Shannon, I'm a superstar
Ride or die like it's Seabiscuit
Tryna stack like Tobey
John Wick, I don't leave a witness
Chris Paul, I'm assistin'
Ameer go Blake Griffin
Give me forty-eight minutes
We go '04 Pistons
Catch a fade like Robert Horry
Only time to get the spotlight
Deray, how I'm top flight
Go Obama when I drop mics
[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I'm the Black Tom Hanks
You can call me Nigga Banks
Secret Agent Cody Banks
Quarter pound of the dank
On the scale and it stank
Put my mama in a Range
I just bought a new Wraith
Nic' Cage with the face-off
John Travolta when I take off
Brad Pitt, start a fight club
Turn the trap into the nightclub
I'm like Prince with the white doves
Paint a picture with the white dust
Lionel Richie with the white bitch
Try to tell it to her nicely
But she never wanna listen
Beat the pussy to submission
Tom Cruise on a mission
Pull a RandB singer
Bring her back to South Central
I shine just like a popstar
M.J. my initial
Kobe Bryant with the spin moves
If these niggas got issues
H-Town with Beyonce
Turn her to my prom date
Kingpin like JAY-Z
Dance moves like JT
[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Heath Ledger with some dreads
I just gave my nigga head
Standing on my two legs
Fuck what that nigga done said
Bruh, I don't fuck with no white boys
'Less a nigga Shawn Mendes
I been off and I been dead
Bad as hell, I don't bench-press
High school, they ain't fuck with me
Now, the critics don't fuck with me
My own fam ain't fuck with me
But Viceland did fuck with me
I'm the only popstar with no money
Can't drive, so I'm still running
Uber taking all my show money
But that's okay, I got more money
Not enough to get my teeth fixed
So my boyfriend in the street, bitch
In the moonlight, I get seasick
Did you see all the art that we did?
Did all that shit in a weekend
We was up all late tweakin', yeah
Ice Cube on a Friday, Chris Tucker on a Friday
Michael Cera on a Friday, Jonah Hill on a Friday
Rockin' Leo's blood diamonds
Sucked off on the highway
Police right behind me like a nigga stole his OJ
Okay, I don't play, got the same last name as O.J.

[Intro: Foster Sylvers]
Take in stride, love and devotion
Don't confide, it's the tracks of lost emotion
Let it glide, it's gonna subside
She stole my
But if just she stole my heart

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I thought I loved her like Common did
I ain't going for the drama, kid
Niggas moved to the city seeking protection
Everything we do, word, shit got me stressin
Stressed out, let me get it squared away
My boy smoke a square a day, no stress, just lifestyle choices
Everyday I wake up, I get dressed, for who? For what?
The city shut down, a ghost town
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
Lot, lot, and that's all I got

[Verse 2: Ryan Betty]
I got everything, the summer came
[?] better day
But I still have dreams of you
I got good dreams of you
She stole my heart, before I landed
Stole my heart, hope I understand it
Stole my heart, but I still got dreams of you
I got good dreams of you
[Chorus: Foster Sylvers]
Stole my heart
But if just she stole my heart[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I'm the same one you seen in the classroom, ayy
We was chillin' in the stall makin' crowds move, ayy
Young K still posted in the A like a Brave
No chain ya boys got would make my neck fuckin' bang
Hangin' on your speaker, bangin' on your speaker, baby (Ayy)
Need to find a reason to make you believe me, baby (Ayy, ayy)
Young NOLA, PlayStation controlla (Ayy, ayy)
Send 'em just to get 'em, I hit 'em when it is over (Ayy)
Roll over, yo soldier, no coaster
I told ya I'm back whenever the storm is over
Send it back if them boys wanna feel the clover
No closure, never reply to faux orders
My nigga so sculptured, such a short quota (Ayy, ayy)
Police pull up on me, boy, I kept that cold shoulder (Ayy, ayy)
Cup runneth over for a hunnid orders (Ayy, ayy)
All I got is pennies, still want me to fuckin' flow, bruh (Ayy)

[Chorus]
There is no love in the ghetto
Money got it where I just can't let go
There is no love in the ghetto
Money got it where I just can't let go
Ooh-oh-ooh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
How you do that right there, boo, I'm bamboozled, yeah
Legs go up behind the head like leopard ambushin', huh
Give her space, big ol' drop, call it Grand Canyon, huh
She bust back, blow a fuse out the damn cannon
Circus, ole, okay (Yeah), roly (Woah)
Poly, slide that (Uh), pole, yeah, (Hm) low blow (Ooh)
Not seen like a dodo (No), I skip fall, stay snow globe (Ayy)
Stuck inside the corridor (Ayy), make me go so loco (Ayy)
Major League, I'm Sheen (Uh), call me Wild Thing (Uh)
She got strings all up the neck just like a violin (Ah)
I crave that chada-ching, when that venom sting (Hey)
Eyes turn redder than a motherfuckin' cherry stem
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Run up a check, ayy, uh (Run up a check)
Hit 'til I miss, ayy, uh (Hit 'til I miss)
And then keep on hittin'
My niggas ain't quittin', they way too legit, ayy, uh (They way too legit)
Don't get on my list, ayy, uh (Don't get on my list)
I'm from the abyss, ayy, uh (I'm from the abyss)
You sayin' you real
But I watch how you act and I can't be convinced, uh
Smokin' 'em out like a habit
You know we could make it tragic (Ayy)
Money had never made a nigga (Ayy)
We holdin' all our money in the mattress (Ayy)
Fire rapid like a savage (Ayy)
Taste is way above your palate (Ayy)
No, I ain't for burying the hatchet (Ayy)
Take a break to pick apart the balance of this madness

[Verse 4: bearface]
Uh
You got big boy money like you ready for war
You be talkin' like you really gon' run that though
You be runnin' like the snot drainin' in from your nose
That's that ice cream, sugar, that cocaine throat
And this shit gon' bounce like my shin off your dome
And you know these boys deep, we ain't fittin' in the door
And my dogs, they bark, Michael Vick on fours
Boy, this shit long gone, why you hit my phone? (Whoa!)
[Bridge]
See how full it is, homie
See how real it is
Hell no

[Outro: Merlyn Wood]
Murder man, murder man
Someone better hold me before this shit gets ugly
Murder man, murder man
Someone better-
Murder man, murder man
Someone better-
Murder man, man
Someone hold me b-, b-, shit gets ug-
Murder man, murder man
Someone better hold me before this shit gets ugly

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
MERLYN! Hopping out the vehicle, I feel like Batman
Hanging with directors, 'bout that action
So please don't stick-and-move in my direction
All I got to lose is my erection

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann and Matt Champion]
I'm a Black man with a deadly weapon
(What drug reference, huh?)
I'm a real dog, we all go to heaven
But I been tripping on the steps, and I don't think I'll make it
I'm in this big house, still, I'm suffocating

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Carnival, my heart like a Supreme Phantom
Going hundred speed, blowin' steam, I throw a tantrum
Judging by my face, my eyes slit like a python
I think she might hate me for a lifetime, ayy, ayy
Daddy cracking redrum, blueprint for the pipeline
Going out the weather, leave my name, I'm goin' offline
I just want my shit to fit, tailored just like Tiffany
Oh, they say I'm perfect, on my back, oh, man, they killing me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Merlyn Wood]
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
White burner, black burner, I do not discriminate
I am on a pilgrimage, so don't try to insinuate
Building up an instrument to aim it at the human race
Let it off in hopes that all the pain and stress disintegrates
I think you intolerant; when you do the most, it's moderate
I come with that gas that'll make you think I had a doctorate
What we do provocative, I ain't no apologist
Don't step to professionals if you still move like novices

[Verse 5: Kevin Abstract]
America's favorite, I do my best and they hate it
It's like I'm stuck in the matrix, and I'm stuck losin' patience
While they stuck on they day shift, I hate my boyfriend's fragrance
I'm a faggot, I say it, I scream that shit like I mean it
Yeah, I'm ugly and genius
I went from nothing to sleeping on Jon's couch
To makin' people bounce at every show that's sold out
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout, with ghouls all in my dirty mouth
Boys be on that silly shit, so Billy 'bout to air 'em out

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Merlyn Wood]
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)



[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noon-ish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

[Pre-Chorus: bearface]
But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you, I want you

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport

[Outro: bearface]
So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh



[Intro: bearface]
It's seven o'clock on the dot, I'm in the drop-top
Your legs on the dashboard (Your legs on the dashboard, oh)
So tell me what I'm to do whenever I'm missin' you?
Tell me, do you love me? I, I

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody's help
I've been lookin' after me like only I can watch my back
Lovin' me and it keeps hurtin' me
I hate it when I lose control over my heart
You know you really turned me on, right from the start
Just to hear you call my name, I call to God
Selfishly, I keep it all for me
Usually, I don't wait too long, but for you, I might

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty and Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
I don't wanna blink and see you out (Haha, I don't, no shade)
Pressed up on my body, like no doubt (No, no, no doubt, no doubt)
I don't want us movin' too fast (Fast, play your part, play your part)
That's a damn shame, but it gon' make your man insane

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty and Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 3: Jon B]
Show me all the sugar I've been patient for
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Show me all the sweet things you've got in store
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Where's the sweet thing, when I need some more, babe?
Show me some sugar when I'm feelin' lonely
Obvious why we relatin', baby, just don't keep me waitin'
Come be my sugar, baby

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty and Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract and Jon B and Ryan Beatty]
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport (So don't run)
Taken my heart, all over again
Watchin' my man, watchin' his body
Look at his body, oh-oh
Oh-oh (Passport)

[Outro: bearface, Joba and Kevin Abstract]
So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh
I'm your candyman
I'll be your candyman
I'm your candyman (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
(Candy, candy, candy, candy, uh)

[Verse 1: bearface]
In the heat of the summer, oh
Yeah, yeah, mhm

Oh yes, you know

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
All I do is work and pray (Ay-yah-woo-woo!)
Tryna' find a place to stay (Ay-yah-woo-woo!)
Tryna' find some food today (Ay-yah-woo-woo!)
This shit is real hard okay? (Okay)
Take that, homie got the Lysol spray, ain't it? (Ain't it?)
You don't wanna see all my bad days, ain't it? (Ain't it?)
You don't wanna see what I got to say, ain't it?
You don't wanna see my boys, man, they ain't friendly

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So it's Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So much Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart
[Verse 2: Ameer Vann and Kevin Abstract]
I just saw my P.O. (What up, nigga?)
He like me, though (He like me, though)
Clean money, tryna stay up out the streets, though
7 days a week though, (All day!) it's that heat, though
My daddy called me, said he seen my last video
Looking at a younger me, coulda had a heatstroke
In the middle of the summer with my negros
Cool cuts and snow cones, smoking to the ozone
Smokin' 'til it's all gone, smoking 'til my folks come home

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

[Interlude]
"Matt has been surfing since he was sixteen, and he taught me how to surf when I was in middle school I think... Maybe freshman year of high school, and we went out. I had my wetsuit on. I was so nervous, because I didn't wanna fall off. I didn't know if I could stand on the board and stay there. I had so much fun waxing the board, and like putting on the leash, and... I knew my dad was good at surfing, so I figured it must be in my genes. Until we went out, and we paddled out... I'd back out and be like "Oh, I'll be ready for the next wave, like okay I'm gonna stand on this one. I know I'm gonna stand on this one... And, I stand up on the wave."



[Video Intro: Ameer Vann and Robert Ontenient]
I could be here all day. You're gonna tell me what I need to know. You're gonna tell me! Are you gonna tell me? C'mon, spit it out...
Me Ilamo Roberto, y este es el camino al exito.

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
My daddy taught me how to sell dope
Turn grams into elbows
Light it up when the L rolled
Black mask, used to kick doors
Wasn't no bullets in the guns though
Niggas still never argued
Raid the house like the task force
Me and my niggas like drug dogs
Find the dope then we take off
Fuck my girl with my chain on
Then she tatted my name on it
Yellowstone, I was raised on it
Actavis in my baby bottle
Baby stroller was an Impala
Niggas like to talk down on me
When I see 'em, I don't hear about it

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
(Merlyn! Merlyn!)
Never would've met my friends if not for satellites
Yeah, I'll cuff her even if she do not suck me right (suck me, suck me!)
Always planned to be a rapper when I failed at life
Luckily professor failed me at the proper time (yee! yee!)
Shh-shh, shh, I say "please" all the time, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, I like white collar crime, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, money digital broke and
Shh-shh, shh, Ghana prince in your messages

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I know you hate me for leavin'
Then let's go crazy together
When I tell ya all the things that I'm thinking
Just so that we could get better
But you wanna put my heart on the stretcher
I don't got insurance for this pressure
Wanna find the benefits, I can't measure
Trying not to run out on my temper
I can see the ash and the ember
That was made from emotional texture
I don't know why I took this endeavor
Don't identify with oppressors
Don't identify with surrender
All of my old friends fair-weather
Gotta treat my heart like a treasure
'Cause all I know is no one else will

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?

[Verse 4: Joba]
You do not know me, don't speak of my homies, you are a phony
Quit pinnin' shit on me, you gon' bring out the old me
You don't wanna know what I wanna do when y'all talk down on my name
I don't wanna see you in the street 'cause I might catch a case
People smile when they face to face (woo, woo, woo!)
Then turn their back and switch up words you say (ah, ah, ah!)
Running to the papers everyday (woo, woo, woo!)
I'm running to the paper anyway (ah, ah, ah!)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract and Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?



[Music Visual Intro Annotation]

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Stripped down to my skin and my bones
I love huskies but I feel like a wolf (Howl!)
In a pack but I feel all alone
I'm scatterbrained man, better offer the Clon'
In Tejas apartments with racists doin' weird shit
Like, this'll make the biopic (Haha!)
Rile 'em up, hit Zaxby's, get the wing and tings (Yum!)
Real quick bills still stacking to the ceiling (Uh-oh...)
What you mean, it ain't working? (What?)
What you mean, you ain't finding yourself? (Oh, I am, I'm trying)
What you mean, you ain't got no cash? (I got a little bit...)
What you mean? What you mean?
Shouldn't your pockets be big just like a fat chick? (Uh-huh!)
Shouldn't your mama be done paying the house off? (I guess?)
Shouldn't you have a real big-ass ego? (No?)
Shouldn't these girls be flockin' just like seagulls? (Eh...)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
The original lick-splickety, higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
Making 'em say "ugh!", they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say I'm off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, I'll remind 'em with hostility
Hot-diggity damn, everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
It's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Don't call me stupid
That ain't the way my name pronounced
Don't call me Cupid
I got too many hoes right now
Poolside in Houston
Tryna see if Beyonce will take me for adoption
Broke-ass rich suburbs
A civilian shot in 3rd Ward, we just by the fountain
This is Merlyn Wood, man
Everywhere I go is The Woodlands
I need a honey-butter
Bodka in a Sprite can
When I'm in the Whataburger
All the kids know who I am
I need a honey-butter
Pouring lean in my Sprite can

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I got a record but I'm clean as they come
I'm Godzilla, when they see me, they run
On 37th, used to run from the Bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears

[Verse 5: Joba]
It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name led to Hollywood
I was living off ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
"You better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street"
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to *NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the get-go
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Intro: Joba]
We failed at a one night stand
I guess that should not matter
You were loved by another man
I guess that should not matter

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
You love to show out
Show your new outfit
You love to show out
When you leave the house
Your new outfit
I love it on you though

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love ya
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
(I love it on you) I love it on you, I love it on you
I love it on you, I love it on you, I love it

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood; w/ Kevin Abstract]
I came to California
I cannot afford this
I just want a fortune
I don't wanna pay no mortgage
I just want life for my kids
Damn, I ain't even have 'em yet
I'm ballin', and it don't stop
And it don't stop
I can see my life through the window glass
If I move with you, I don't need no cash
Had a dream last night that she loved me back
Keep God in my head, so a nigga bounced back
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Fell in love, but it ain't gon' last
Hydroplane like I ain't gon' crash
No frame with my face on glass
No rank when they check my class
Got a minute, got a second, got a day
Gotta get it, gotta find another way
I ain't tripping, I'm just feeling what I say
I ain't talking, I'm just spilling from my brain
Everybody think I got it figured out
Chasing sanity while niggas chasing clout
Show me love in the face of all doubts
That would tell me all I need to know about you
Ain't nobody gon' love you like me
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like me
Baby girl, I know we can save the world
So why you wanna fight me?

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You love to show out
Show your new outfit
I love it on you, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love it[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I can barely rap, I can barely dance
I can barely laugh, I can barely hang
I want a male stripper to do a belly dance
For me and my boyfriend, that's entertainment
And I'm drunk as fuck, my niggas tuxed up
I need a reason to get my bucks up
I need a reason to care about society
They need a good enough reason just to hire me
But honestly, you see my mom can't walk
And her lungs don't work like they used to
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of music
I be saying shit that's just fucking rude and untrue, and
But truthfully, the words had damage, and it's cruel to me
But even more cruel to be
Dissing you in front of niggas that pay to hear me

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes I be wondering, why I been tripping off it
I should probably spend my time
Writing rhymes in the dentist's office
That's killing two birds in one stone
When I was younger, way before I was grown
I wanted a deal with Death Row or Rhymesayers
I'm saving my time for mics later
I might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later
I hate writers, I hate tweets, I hate journalists
They hate truth, they hate peace
They want my niggas to burn with us
[Verse 2: Joba]
Flicking on the face of my wristwatch
Watch the time stop just to speed up, watch life unfold
And between the tick-tocks, speeding down the one-way
Fuck these signs, fuck these lights, put my life on the line
When it feel right, I'm fine, no, I'm not lying, don't ask me
I'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it
But hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory
Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me
All my life I've felt inadequate
And through the years I've dealt with tragedy after tragedy
God, send a message, send a messenger my way
Never claimed to be a saint, forgive me
Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished
I'm haunted, by the visions of my youth turned true
I've come to expect my expectations aren't true
But I'm a master of believing my lies
And you can't break me, and I can't brake at the speed of light

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I'm afraid to share the bed, what if she want money later?
Like she got laid off, uh, hit my lawyer for some paper
I'm afraid to speak my pains like, "You lucky where you at"
"You cool, but quit complaining 'bout all that"
That's why I'm showing up late
I'm not tryna be a dick, but my time is not to waste
For my shell, fuck the small talk with my sensei
Where my sense at? Four-cylinder go round
Lincoln Town Car pick me up, drop me off
I got bubble under my biceps, sneak me into the sidestep
Ego is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect
Fuck it, I'll be myself now, tell 'em I take no shit now
Tell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down
Tell 'em I work, like, what, what time for me now?
Wondering "who is me?" now, wondering where you been now
Lose you in crowds, I see now, 14, I see 'em all inside of me now
Bank account move like speeds now, make it from ways to feed now
Thinking of ways to be everything but right now
[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
It's crazy how things feel the best
When reminiscing 'til we check ourselves
It's crazy how people who left
Say they feeling left out when we step for health
Still accustomed to nights filled with solitude
I don't always remember to call goodnight
I don't always remember my altitude
I don't always remember to stop the fight
But I might check my sight, it ain't right
Yeah I know, but my strife overwhelms, every night
Until I'm forced to close my eyes
Brain disease, parasite, eating me from inside
Emotions bleed, I can't believe
How I'm slipping through the night[PART 1: EVANIE]

[Verse: bearface]
Evanie
Did you lie to him since you were seventeen?
How's he holding up?
Evanie
Do you cling to him like you would onto me?
Bet he needs you more than I
Evanie
Did you hide your neck to save him from his sleep?
I know how that feels
Evanie
Every chance you take, you make me want to flee
Can't you see?

[Chorus: bearface]
You should move on
I swear you'll be fine
Whenever you want
I'll be your ride
And when you're alone
And his love is gone
Maybe you'll see that your company
Was the worst thing for him
Your sin
[PART 2: TEAM]

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract, Ameer Vann]
Little old me, I thought my world was progressive
'Cause my president was Black, twenty-five lighters on the dresser
I had guilt trip on my back and a bulletproof vest
Inside my Uncle John's Toyota was a walking Crayola, ah-
(Gimme that mic, nigga)
I got a hard time, I gotta watch myself
The way I move through a room full of suits, ain't no
Ain't no Constitution, I hate uniforms (Hahaha!)
I hate handcuffs, I can't stand up (Shut up, nigga!)
They throw me in the crowd and tell me "Boy, I'd lose that smile"
But see I got it from my dad and that's the reason why we had
I raise my black fist, I got big lips
I'm strong as Samson, they cut my fucking locks
I lose my fucking strength

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Fuck, I'm running out of zips
My life been feeling tense, I won't be on the fence
I put my phone on airplane mode 'cause I'm on autopilot
I need a lot of patience, I need a lot of silence

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I hope this holy water burn because I ain't worth this life
I ain't worth the light of day, but for some I light the way
Nude along the banister, kitchen smell of lavender
Swimming in my Wranglers, I am another caliber
[Outro: bearface]
Ooh, yeah
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Soon, no no, no no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, ooh
Soon, come on
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, ooh
No

[Intro to "HEAT" begins]Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Uh, technical difficulties
Me and my niggas been thinkin' about, yeah
Gettin' up out of this house, hey
I've been thinkin' about Enrique
And Davion, man, yeah
I love this song, man, yeah
Iove the brackets, got all my niggas back together
Love to have it, love to see it
How you been? Still dreamin'
European, my daddy texts me a bunch
Am I ever text a nigga back?
Back, back, back in the day
All of a sudden, that's before, 'fore, yeah, back
Stuck in heaven, tryin' peaches just like, hey
Still young, hopin' it is
Feelin' back home, handle my business
I had the vision but hey, man, I guess you can't do the business
Think back to house, still, these are my niggas for real
This is that real, real, real
Sittin' on top of the ceilin'
This is my nigga, for real, those are my family, sure
Think I'll marry 'em, yeah
This is my nigga, for real
Those are my family, sure
Think I'll marry 'em, yeah
[Verse 2: Ryan Beatty]
Flyin' through the breezes
Only wind can touch my skin
All these roses that come, back to back in my head
But something's missing
But time still tickin'
And it's breakin' me slow, my Lord
Caught crying in the corner
But something's missing

[Interlude: August Royals]
Give me some free time. Feel like I'm stumbling again
Let me see some red lights [?]
It's like I'm goin' ninety-five in a school zone
Too fucked up to realize I'm speeding, impacting lives, I jeopardize everybody I run into, what?
No matter where I go tonight, Can't get away I
Just another sleepless night (just another, just another just another)
Got people crashing around me, gettin' lit up like a b-day candle. Remember when we were five and bein' lit was something that didn't involve no Grey goose handle?
Life changes, man, not for the best. Nostalgia is innocent, something you could never repossess
I still start dancing in the rain. Other times I wish I was a teardrop, though
Maybe a raindrop ain't so bad falling from the sky
Sometimes I think about fallin' from the sky myself, and it's not in the right way
Nobody asked me to be this way, I'm just inside

[Verse: Ameer Vann]
I done been in trouble 'bout as long as I remember
My momma tried to help me but I hardly ever listened
So she sent me to them white schools, I learned that I was different
They told me I'm a nigga, well, now I know I am
I got my finger on the trigger, I'm a project baby
A free-lunch felon, and I'm hungry every minute
Empty stomach, weed smoke can't fill it
If you don't listen to me, I set fire to the building
Need to listen to the children and the weapons they concealing
Hear the voices of a million when I sell my first million
I am bound to go diamond, ain't no luck or surprises
I am tanning on an island
I can feel the pressure, but I see my new horizons
Me and all my niggas getting stars down on Sunset Boulevard
But niggas from the Southside with Xan bars and gunplay
Niggas on that "Someday..."
If you shooting for the stars, you only headed one way

[Intro: BROCKHAMPTON]
Spending all my nights alone, waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Tell me what I'm waiting for

[Bridge: DigyBhroniK and BROCKHAMPTON]
Tell me what I'm waiting for
(Do you love me, love me, love me)
Tell me what I'm waiting for
(Do you love me, love me, love me)

[Verse: DigyBhroniK]
All these nights without a call or a text
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Shawty tell me what I'm waiting for
Do I needa wait some more?
Do I needa wait some more?
Do I needa (uh)
Do I needa (uh)
All these nights without a call or a text
You dropped your ex to be with me
Now you got me thinking that I'm next
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Do I needa wait some more?
Do I needa wait some more?
[Verse: BROCKHAMPTON]
Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
You slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
That lens zooming in, catching all my stripes
Used to trade a joint for some Molly
And she gave me all I need for the night
40s suffice, morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm acting foolish
Could you pick me up around noon-ish?
Half a blunt, yeah we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Time to take a seat and yeah we cruisin'

[Verse: BROCKHAMPTON]
And I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself, but I make it right
Baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you
I'ma make you see that
I want you
I want you

[Chorus: DigyBhroniK and BROCKHAMPTON]
Spending all my nights alone, waiting for you to call me
(Tell me what I'm waiting for)
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
(Tell me what I'm waiting for)
[Outro: DigyBhroniK and BROCKHAMPTON]
So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me?

[Intro: Amnesty and DJ Bobbito Garcia]
It don't make no difference
What you say about it
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Summertime, I got my head out the window
Your car smell like weed, it's that good Texas Indo
Back when nobody believed in me except for you
They don't accept you, unless they get to dress you
Technically speaking; it's making me bitter
I'm too high to focus, and more weed got delivered
What could make our life simpler, send it straight to my liver
Send my name out in flames, and then it crash in the winter
I showed up boy and I checked out the same day
I signed in boy, and I logged out the same date
Oh, mmh, mmh, ayy
My OGs told me, "Do it my way"
Texas boys, everything is sideways
Might upload the whole tape to MySpace
I like the music blown out, that's just my taste
Keep the vinyl packed in some blue crates

[Interlude: Matt Champion]
(Look up at the stars if you start to get lonely
It's crazy this all started with just us wanting some money)
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
What do I want out of life, what do I bleed for?
So many shoulders, I can go and lean my head on
But I still smoke and crave respect from those that cheer on
Wish I could focus more on what I get my cheer from
Who really know you, who really love you? I wanna see
I gotta hit you for a mission and, yes, we outspeed
So many take the high road to let the pain seep
I need to learn a lot in life is a one-way-street
Yeah, the ghost where Waco is, only time for takeout
Not a lot of room in this world, so keep your gate up
I'll meet you at the driveway, call Matt out
With the lights on, bright for real, drive back out
Yeah, jet-lag for pilots, only flyin' to islands
All them taxes filed, money gettin' piled in
Green by the millions, turn to envy by the thousand
Love to bring me down in the depths you drown in

[Outro: Amnesty]
It don't make no difference
What you say about it
No, no, things can't stay the same

[Intro Sample: Interviewer and Princess Diana]
"What effect did the depression have on your marriage?"
"Well, it gave everybody a wonderful new label, 'Diana's unstable and Diana's mentally imbalanced', and unfortunately, that seems to have stuck on over the years."
"Are you saying that label stuck within your marriage?"
"I think people used it. And it stuck."
"According to press reports, it was suggested that it was around this time things became so difficult, that you actually tried to injure yourself. Is that true?"
"Mhm. When no one's listening to you, or you feel like no one's listening to you, all sorts of things start to happen . For instance, you have so much pain inside yourself, that you try and hurt yourself on the outside, because you want help, but it's the wrong help you're asking for. People see it as crying wolf or attention seeking, and they think because you're in the media all the time, you've got enough attention, inverted commas, but I was actually crying because I wanted to get better."

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood, Matt Champion, and Dom McLennon]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, now, now
Give it to me now, now, now
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract and Merlyn Wood]
Sometimes I be mad that I ain't sexy
Sometimes I be shy to show my blessings
Poppin' like a carbonated beverage
The cops poppin' niggas Orville Redenbacher
Ian, you sexy!
[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Most times I give friends more time than family
You remember when I used to feel like I don't understand me
Now we speakin' the same language
I don't listen like I can be
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Sometimes I feel like I'm way too sexy
Most the singers found me in the desert
Minimi-, minimi-
Handle my business, don't talk to me directly
No one above me actin' like they all so lovely
Recogni-, Recogni-
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Heels switchin', finger clicking
Kick on me like I'm James Bond on a role
They want the boot of my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
You need a neutral career
Look what we did in a year
Yeah! Yeah!
[Verse 4: Joba]
Oh, I'm lonesome, and hopeless
But hopeful, but hopeful
What's a boy to do lost in the world trying to find a balance
Sippin' out his chalice with its jewels dancing
Fluid like the potion
That pours when I get down some
Just trying to find a port in the sky where
The sun can shine down some
Jesus is lord, I put that on god
What more do you want from me?
He's in the dark, he's just a child
They turned their backs on me
Nevermind what it was
I see enemies
Don't want what's best for me
Best believe

[Bridge: Joba]
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, But hopeful
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, But hopeful

[Verse 5: Kevin Abstract]
'Times, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I been in my feelings on that island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said I tried vacation, I tried to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day
For a quiet texas place, and a BBQ plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for ya
[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Give it to me, Give it to me
Give it to me now, Give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me now, Give it to me now, now, now

[Intro: London Community Gospel Choir, bearface]
I gotta get that bag
It's a thug life, it's a thug life
I gotta get that bag (Run, sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)
It's a thug life (La-da-da-da)
It's a thug life (It's a, oh-uh-oh)
Ooh-ah (Sha-na-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)
La-da-da-da (It's a- ooh-uh-oh)

[Verse 1: bearface]
Try to treat man like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Boy you know you don't look fly
Dem gold chains turn your neck green, bye
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
It's different reconciling with skeletons I ain't know I possessed
I sought perfection out in ways I no longer accept
I understand what I neglect in times when I obsess
I'm learning to confess, this fate is harder to digest
The biggest threat I'm up against is who I face in my reflection
Depression still an uninvited guest I'm always accepting
Can't help but meet the feeling with a familiar embrace
When I know that it'll kill me if I give into my brain
I see the shadows inside, they ten feet tall with no eyes
They put my head in the water and it's so beautiful under
The sun reflecting off the corals, colors I can't describe
To make the darkness divine
[Outro: bearface]
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah
(La-da-da-da) It's a, oh-uh-oh
Ooh-ah
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah
(La-da-da-da) It's a, oh-uh-oh
Ooh-ah
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna minimize
I want a moment to remember time
I want a friend of mine
So crazy to me, life is still wintertime, wintertime
Wintertime when I was [?]
Tripping off, fucking up every coat
All of my niggas that left me broke
All of my brothers, I feel like I'm home

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
Wintertime, wintertime
Remember when you were a friend of mine?
Remember when we couldn't get in line?
Now we the reason why they in the line
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
Cold tray like you do the drops
And raise the skies I need new socks
Cause I'm walking out with no shoes on, yeah
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
[?]
Wintertime, wintertime
The sky is fallin'
The sky is fallin'

[Verse 1: Joba]
Too many things I'd rather do different
Woke up in a cold sweat (Uh!)
My emotions creepin'
Three o'clock on the weekend, might as well sleep in
Stay down for the count when
She hit me with the "what-ifs?"
And the "what-whens?" and the "what-thens?"
Wonder where my life went, living in the moment
I been thinking 'bout my time spent, are the bills paid?
Is it make or break? Will I find a way?
Have my feelings changed? Will I be okay? I don't know
But what I do know is, life don't make sense
If you can't pay rent, so I place my bet

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away (Yah)
You left a spell on my Saturday

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I got cracks in my phone screen
The past fuck with my psyche
Smoke weed and get high, please
Went to school in The Woodlands
And that made niggas wanna fight me
So I don't take threats lightly
Tell them niggas, "Come and find me"
Gotta say it in my eye view
New house off iTunes
New money, my perfume
Big smile, in a good mood
I been running out of issues
I ain't trippin' when the rent due
I ain't runnin' with a pistol
I ain't locked in the system
Taking care of my kinfolk
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Taking a book out the page of the greats
I'm only human and I make mistakes
Chisel my flows so they can't liberate
Talking the time as the pendulum sways
I gotta face what I didn't create
Just 'cause I can't relate, I don't debate
I educate, illuminate
Or we can't duplicate, no more moving the plates
Second chances feeling overrated
Unappreciated, so I bossed up
Missed the time when we could share space
But it'll all be straight the day we cross up
Nothing better than some time with you
Because it's time I never wanna toss up
Lose myself inside of you, you find yourself in me
I don't wanna be cautious

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away (Yah)
You left a spell on my Saturday
[Outro: Joba]
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?

[Intro: bearface]
And mother, I am sorry, I never pick up, mm-hmm
Because I'm afraid to disappoint ooh, ooh-ah, ooh, no

[Chorus: serpentwithfeet]
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to

[Verse 1: bearface]
We were sat outside on the Harvard floor
With our feet in dirt, and our hearts in awe
I be losin' sleep thinkin' 'bout missed calls
And I see the names circling our thoughts
And I think about if we lose it all
And I turn to shit that you'd never want
Like the smoke, the drink, anything at all
And I'll say again, "Sorry I don't call"
There's no money on my mind
But my money or my mind
What's the first to fall?
I never wanted this shit, yeah

[Chorus: serpentwithfeet]
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when Auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I've been in my feelings on an island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said, "I'll try vacation, I'll try to run away"
I deleted Facebook, I'll trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place and a barbecue plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for you, is that good for you?
My ghost still haunt ya, my life is I, Tonya
A big-eyed monster, only face to conquer
I hated songs about fame 'cause that stuff meant nothin'
Until them headlines came, then first flight I'm stuck in

[Bridge: Joba]
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I took a plane to somewhere that I've never been
Too many times without my sister and my brother
Dad or mother by my side but they're in spirit
I always hear it, I know they feel it
My momma always had these dreams that used to keep her up at night
I smoke to keep them all away and make use of the time
I'm void of feelin'
The reasons I'm so out of touch now start revealin'
But I'm not ashamed, I'm not afraid of who I am
Or how I trust my mental, yeah, it's not perfect
But I guess that's just the shit I'm into
I fantasize about a time when everything was simple
My shelter sheltered me from things I needed to commit to
The way it stands to me
A victim of Stockholm in my friendships and family

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
What's costin' your time? What's the reason that you whine?
What's in your wallet? Dead whites in mine
So sour, in this light of lime
Daddy said "Study or get that cash"
Mommy said "Your career ain't gon' last"
Loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
I just need a chance to move past my past
Don't think too fast, private jets still crash
And I'll still fly coach, and I'll still hit a roach
And I'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
Touch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
(Somebody's gonna have to tell the truth and I'm gonna tell it!)

[Outro:  serpentwithfeet and Matt Champion]
I will
I will
(I don't matter)
I will
(Ahh)
Can I tell you how?
Can I tell you now?
I will

I deleted Facebook, I'll trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place and a barbecue plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for you, is that good for you?
My ghost still haunt ya, my life is I, Tonya
A big-eyed monster, only face to conquer
I hated songs about fame 'cause that stuff meant nothin'
Until them headlines came, then first flight I'm stuck in

[Bridge: Joba and Jazmine Sullivan]
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I took a plane to somewhere that I've never been
Too many times without my sister and my brother
Dad or mother by my side but they're in spirit
I always hear it, I know they feel it
My mom will always have these dreams
That used to keep her up at night
I smoke to keep them all away and make use of the time
I'm void of feelin'
The reasons I'm so out of touch now start revealin'
But I'm not ashamed, I'm not afraid of who I am
Or how I trust my mental, yeah, it's not perfect
But I guess that's just the shit I'm into
I fantasize about a time when everything was simple
My shelter sheltered me from things I needed to commit to
The way it stands to me
A victim of Stockholm in my friendships and family

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
What's costin' your time? What's the reason that you whine?
What's in your wallet? Dead whites in mine
So sour, in this light of lime
Daddy said "Study or get that cash"
Mommy said "Your career ain't gon' last"
Loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
I just need a chance to move past my past
Don't think too fast, private jets still crash
And I'll still fly coach, and I'll still hit a roach
And I'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
Touch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
(Somebody's gonna have to tell the truth and I'm gonna tell it!)

[Outro: Jazmine Sullivan, Ryan Beatty and serpentwithfeet and Matt Champion]
I will
I will
(I don't matter)
I will
(Ahh)
Can I tell you now?
Can I tell you now?
I will

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be

It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Flap, flap, flap your wings, go high
Go high, go high
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride around the night
This little town, I wanna say goodbye
To everybody here cause they're all the same
I hate this place
And everybody here is all the same
Life's a disgrace

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Flying on my rocket ship (ay!), I'm on an acid trip (ay!)
I need another pill, snort and let it drip
I'm with my white friends, we getting wasted
Trapped in the suburbs, we suffocatin' (ay!)
We get all our drug (ay!) and education
"You came with black folks?" Hoe, your parents racist
You say they hate me? Well, I love them
We still roll up, we still best friends (ay!)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Everybody smilin', I don't see what's funny
Everybody friends, guess I wasn't lucky
Family full of athletes, I was kind of chubby
Shit was never sunny, wrists were sorta bloody
Lick my wounds with honey, save me for the vultures
I'm fallin' in the void, I don't know what I discover
I know I could hear the thunder, I can feel the hunters
They be preying on my hunger, I won't let 'em make me suffer 'cause

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy

Some days I just don't feel it (Don't feel it, yeah)

Your hatin' made me fearless (Me fearless)
If it do not make me happy or bread
Then, dawg, well, I just can't deal with it (Deal with it, yeah)
Swear to God I'm 'bout my business (My business, yeah)

There they go twistin' my words
Tal'm 'bout this what he say she say
Tell 'em, "I don't give a fuck"
Tell 'em, "It ain't my concern"
You ain't gotta be in my world
Tal'm 'bout this what he say she say
I don't give a fuck
(Give a fuck, give a fuck)
Stay ridin' 'round with my team, we don't give a fuck
I keep my space serene, still don't give a fuck
They don't wanna see me gleam, I been knew wassup

[Verse 3: Christian Alexander]
(Yeah, okay, yeah)
My attention span is outrageous
So invested 'til you come faceless
Where's the finish line that I can work towards?
'Cause otherwise I'm on vacation
My location gone, my dick is long
I'm up and down 'til I make a song
Now tell me what I'm doin' wrong
So I can leave your ass and I make you feel neglected
Paranoid and uninvested
My money's gone but there's a bigger picture I got goin' on
"Who you signin' to? When the album come?
When your next shit drop?
Can you make a song
That goes on the lines of "Going Thru?"
'Cause your new shit's good, but I gotta say
When I heard those chords I was blown away"
Nah, fuck that
My family just wants their son back
Lucky me, I'm just a scumbag
I watch a little TV, then it's back to the lab again
Workin' nights 'cause I wanna compete with producers
Out do these brain-dead losers
Yeah, you hate me, that's excuses, and I hate you too
If we were in the same room I think I'd fuck you too
I'm done with playin' games, you lame excuse of a stoner boy
I'm tired of people weighin' me down
I'm about to drown in this empty void cause
Hey, I'm done with playin' games, shawty
Yeah, she wanna suck my dick, shawty

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, bearface and Playa]
(-day, ooh, yeah, ooh)
They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (-day, ooh, yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (-day, ooh, ooh, fun)
All day, all night, I work
Shawty like (The luxury suite)
Shawty like (With marble floors)
Shawty like (-day, ooh, yeah, ooh)
They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (-day, ooh, yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (-day, ooh, ooh, fun)
I think all night, I work
Shawty like (It's like a luxury suite)
Shawty like  (With marble floors)
Shawty like

[Outro: Ryan Beatty]
Nobody sees it like we do
Nobody knows what we've been through
It's been a hell of a year, but I know you got me and I got you
Now look at the love, look at the love
Nobody sees it like we do
Nobody knows what we've been through
It's been a hell of a year, but I know you got me and I got you
Now look at the love, look at the love

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
The purest color is achieved by using just one
Wavelength, at a high intensity
Such as in, laser lights

Laser lights (laser lights)

The intensity drops
Back when SATURATION drops

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Walk before I get in
If my head's down well then my knees grown hair
Walk before I get in
If my head's down then I feel them stare
Oh, every day you got a problem with me
What I do to deserve that bullshit?
Like every bitch wanna fuck on me
I'm gay, what'd I do to deserve this?
Gimme that pussy, gimme that pussy
I wanna love your pussy, but I hate pussy
Don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay
I know you feel the way, I need you to wait, I need you to wait
Don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
I put it on like god hurt, drowning in all my woes
I never sang my shot, this soundin' like my chores
You won't know if I needed you, [?]
Got a taste and it just gets lighter
Need that head, then the more I'm broke
But you know that you're not helping
Girl, your body language is [?]
Got real something, I know that you a virgin
Yeah, why you do me like that?
Probably 'cause I'm feelin' on your booty like that
Gotta turn lights, keep it moving on track
I'm a [?] like that
[Verse: Ameer Vann]
It's like a hundred bitches on my phone, nigga, I don't spend the night
I just left your house and I'm on the way, this my third stop tonight
But you're the first one I call, you could always make it right
All the things I can say, I'm a different kind of nigga
I need Broadway lights, I need eight gold figures
I need money, keep the fame, I need pussy, keep the love
Watered lean, it's the same, I need Jesus up above
I need seven more days and I need fuckin' more nights
'Cause I don't know the right way and my mind ain't right
So I smoke and pray about it, I don't sleep through the night
I need more, I need, wait a minute

[Verse: Jesse Rutherford]
Oh, I'm in the zone, give me that flow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's just an illusion, sorry for confusing you
I don't usually do this, I don't want him using you
Get it off my mind, baby (Ooo, ooo)
Mhm, I'm so tired of wasting time, babe
I got so much more to do, yeah
Huh, I'm singing "yeah, yeah, hallelujah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know I had to go and keep the flow real quick
Jesse get up in the morning and he gotta take the flow real quick
Like phantom on me, like shining on me, so bright all the time
Haha, huh, and it sound like I checked my sight on my right
But I don't even do that
Jesse be like "Who that?"
Jesse be like "Who that?"
I'm not talking 'bout J. Cole
Jesse sound like a date hoe
Jesse twist sayin' everything
Jesse switchin' like a hundred lanes
Skrt, skrt past the boom, motherfucker
Jesse sound like a fuckin' [?], motherfucker
Coming straight right out the blue, motherfucker
Brockhampton the crew, motherfucker
Yeah, he's so cute, motherfucker
Like Cupid, like Betty Boop, motherfucker

[Intro]
Use me for your service (For your service)
Here am I, Lord

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas was in that back room
See, I ain't sitting with that
Niggas was hitting that glass tube
Yeah, I ain't fuckin' with that
Auntie was smoking that crack too
My mama was dealin' with that
Big skies out in Corpus
Them lights was so gorgeous
In the garage, I made a fortune
I'm still tryna fuck every Mormon
It's amazing how I'm still searching, y'all
Still reaching, man, fuck the law
Above the law, she above the law
Close the blinds, let the lights go off
Duck low in case they raid us all
And take it all with speed and ease
He like me on my knees
Generational trauma things
I wonder how far I could bring
This shit to my existence, my nigga
Can I get a witness? I lived it
Turn into a vicious, I spit it
Looked at me and rip it, just get it

[Bridge]
You ain't the only one that's searching for that 1-9
You gotta go ahead and let that sun shine

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Everything gon' be okay
I'm 'bout to steal a whip and drive that bitch to Montana
My feelings roll, that's when I throw tantrum
LA, LA, LA road
Everything gon' be okay
I'm 'bout to steal a whip and drive that bitch to Montana
My feelings roll, that's when I throw tantrum
LA, LA, LA road

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I left some ghosts in my mama house
Standing alone with the shell of my past
I probably still should be underground
I know that nobody thought this would last
It's been bigger than the music
When it hits you feel it you don't have to try
Why would I care for your validation
When you couldn't look me in the eyes
Clutching your purse in elevators
But I wrote your income off on my taxes
They don't want a social commentator
They just wanna hear a nigga rapping
You start to feel a bit of freedom
Then they wanna stop and frisk you in the boardroom
Everybody wanna tell you what you're worth
Until you know your worth and then they can't ignore you
Wait a minute for what you pray for
Halle Salassie, Halleluja
Word to Buddha, Insha'Alla
I've been falling back into the void
Somewhere in-between overjoyed and annoyed
And I can't feel a fuckin' thing
Take a moment just to blink
Take a breath, let it think
Wash my hands, let 'em sink

[Verse: Victor Roberts]
My fuckin' Power Rangers couldn't protect me from that LAPD kick door
Motel, pig-pork
Swim through the living room, straight to the bedroom, lookin' for bricked dope
My papa looked at my mama, lookin' at that closet like
"There that shit go"
Two keys and a thumper, 10K with the mustard
A whole family and no buster, this don't add up
My padre facin' them three strikes
And my mama just smacked the pipe
Crack smoke got crash tight, this shit still bad, 'cause
The boys peeped a Brillo pad and some glass tucked
And it's lookin' like my parents was up in here runnin' all through that stash dumb
But the fact, crack different than coke
Plus the smoke wasn't close enough to choke me
Lowered scrutiny so mom could kick big facts for bruh
The truth is we held the bag for this kid we took in
Tryna part with his old ways, maybe we all mistook him
'Cause I knew something was fucked up when he said
"Don't open or look in this here satchel that I'll be back for in just a couple of minutes"
Then hella hours later, like do I cook dinner now or later?
Worried about cold food for a cold fool
Motherfucker put my family in danger
I blame myself, pardon my anger
I never looked inside his stuff so he never really needed to hide his stuff
When you showed me what was really inside this stuff
I never had a clue
Now I know as police, you gotta do what you gotta do
But this my family, all I got is us, my nigga
My own mother just shot at us, my nigga
This is why we here
And I don't fuck with niggas I don't know
But I had a heart to help this kid in danger, tears in anger
Gemini gettin' violently
Police silence don't help anxiety
My daddy's priors tame all of his wildin'
All of these pilots, not one of them flyin'
Y'all planning on trying?
This flight is diving, nose tucked
Po-po stuck, play your part
All this commotion and neighbors listenin' like, "Oh fuck"
Shit finna spark
All this emotion, need a decision made with some heart
'Cause ours is broken, they tryna lock the third notch on my pop's choker
This shit ain't kosher
Moms is oh for if CPS get sent them pages
I ain't gon' see my parents for ages
All this erosion, no more protection
Shit don't feel safe
What graduation? What degrees?
What dissertation? What imagination?
Imagine my whole world taken away from me
All over some bass and misconstrued melodies
My heart racin', clutchin' my red Ranger, pacin'
I can barely breathe
And mister policeman, told policeman, we got what we need
Just let 'em be
[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me
Thank God that I'm built for the distance

Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me

Thank God for me, thank God for me

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Como se dice? Don't touch on me with them dedos
I minimize all your credentials, I maximize all of my pesos
I want that dance that can do it, give it to me straight, don't dilute it
I'm one-handed like Odell, numb the pain like Orajel
Up and down like gopher bear, hand on me like "Oh, well"
What that smell like, oh, Chanel? Way too deep like depths in hell
Need a smoking shot of whiskey, down this bitch like, oh, they prissy
Talking smack, oh, don't get lippy, love on you, oh, don't forget me

[Chorus: Matt Champion]

Radiation is present, got my reflection iridescent
Every little moment I step in, might shift the planets direction
Glitch in the system is present
You might wanna check the connection
I don't give a fuck about freshmans
I don't give a fuck about veterans
If your perception ain't ascending, it's no reason for extension
Of my energy, this shit only happens once in a century
It's elementary when all you speak is rudimentary
Paradiddles hidden in riddles; vapid and accessories
So please don't get it mistaken, opportunities taken
Didn't want to be patient, we had to fight for this thing
Ain't no acting complacent, the disrespect been too blatant
We claimed this spot from the basement, so tell me, who you again?
Oh you was this, you was that?
But now you washed and you hate it?
You taking shots with revolvers, I got two drones at the station
Hit the button, they might come and leave your legacy vacant
You paved a path we didn't want to get demolished with aging

Ho-ho-ho, bitch, I'm santa
I just know your girl, I'm at her address
No, these hoe-hoe-hoes, oh no-no-no
She a ho-ho-ho, but her name Merlyn
Heard your dare friend, pulled up in her basement
I went, "No-no-no," ain't no Merlyn
Then she let me in, her backdoor-door-door-door
I'm supposed to see your girl and her anus
She pulled the gift out my pants while I get breakfast
I took her cookies back in Indiana
I been gettin' to the cash bro, you cannot tell
I been eatin' good, why they call it brisket
Oh, that's your girl? Don't ever play yourself
Now my genitals in her, it's in pair with Merlyn
I been gettin' to the cash, like cereal
I'm serious[Verse: bearface]
Was I more than it's worth
Or will you see my name and I'll fade?
Pitch my camp in your mind
Sat by the fire, behind your eyes
And I'll look through them just once or twice
But I might see something I don't like
Like your hands in his shirt
Entwined in cotton, his loving smirk

[Chorus: bearface and No Rome]
Losing my way, ohh
Seeing your name, but I'll be fine, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
(No worries) Losing my way, ohh
Did I come again dressed out like a shame? Cloudy
Seeing your name
Eyes are but a pain, roses in my veins, sorry
But I'll be fine, yeah (no worries)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (no worries)

Thottie, thottie on the name tag
Quick nap when the plane lag
Overdressed with my late ass
I'm still in [coat?] so I can't brag
Perfect titties with the trained ass
Bitch act your age since I can't ask
Got a lot if it can't last
Some are ready for the rain-pass, but I ain't mad
Hallelujah, all the music therapeutic
Therapy makes me go to sleep
Back up on my feet, back up into a meet
Guess what you could say: I'm back into team
[West is?] lookin' nice, time to eat
Gotta get a play, call me for the green
Just to say my graces, gotta see a priest
Just to save my graces, gotta see a priest

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
All the boys move around and they watchin' me
With my girls in the back in the VIP
And I'm messin' just to keep 'em on the toes
And when I leave with you, I keep it on the low
All the boys move around and they watchin' me
With my girls in the back in the VIP
And I'm messin' just to keep 'em on the toes
And when I leave with you, I keep it on the low

You know, I really love pools, and I love water because it's really fun to be in water and be in pools... And I like to drink water, and um, I went to go see BROCKHAMPTON at their house in Beverly Hills and they had a pool and there was water inside of it. And we made a song, um, but yeah that's why I've just always loved pools and water."
"Hold on, hold on, hold on! Is that what I think it is? Is this what I think it is!? Is this new BROCKHAMPTON!? Oh, they about to play a new BROCKHAMPTON song!? I think we about to play a new BROCKHAMPTON song! Let's go!"



[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
They split my world into pieces, I ain't heard from my nieces
I been feeling defeated, like I'm the worst in the boyband
I ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends
Lead my niggas, y'all sheepin', I keep the world in my hands
I know accounts should be deleted
I know some niggas should stop hitting my phone
Whenever they needing money or favors done
'Cause I'm still worried 'bout when Ashlan finna put the razor down
So I don't really give a fuck about what story they done spun
And I ain't done (No, no)
Yeah (Tell something)
And I ain't done, you heard me?
I ain't done (Yeah, I'm screaming oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I really miss the old days before the cosigns
I really miss them cold days before the road signs
I really miss when I ain't know which way I was supposed to head
And I was pressed because my shawty gave me cold signs
I was writing poems 'bout her dawg in study hall
And she was mad 'cause I never wanna show her off (Scared)
And every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screaming

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I don't wanna waste no more time
I'm ready to go
I put my life on standby
I can leave you alone

[Scratches: Kevin Abstract]

[Verse 2: Joba]
'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
Life is a dish served cold most times
And all my life I've taken handfuls
Force-fed by the hand that feeds us
But not all hands created equal
I stand by, waiting for something good to come
In due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
My mother called me today
She said she thought she felt my energy a country away
I apologized for not calling enough due to weight
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay
I asked her "Why this world love echoing hate?"
She said "Don't let those who don't know you start dictating your fate"
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
Conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake
It's no debate
The road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
And recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel
This world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
Sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
You never needed them if they make you another villain

[Interlude: Joba, Sammy Jo and Tune Up]
Pressure
"They tried to take the bike. And they took my friend's bike and then my friend was gonna get it back but then he didn't get it back and then we had to go to the police station. And then, um, then some  (Pressure) random stranger brought back his bike. We just, you know, and we didn't tell our mums so we got in trouble (Pressure makes me-) because they found out like a day later."
Do you want to start the game again?

[Bridge: Joba]
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Take it all or leave it
Pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu-
Wish I could, wish I could, wish I-
I can't take, I can't take, I can't-
Makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me-
Pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu-
Wish I could, wish I could, wish I-
I can't take, I can't take, I can't-
Makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me-

[Outro: Joba]
Sipping on my pain, smoking by my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Sipping on my pain, smoking by my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Take it all or leave it
Sipping on my (Sipping on my), smoking by my (Smoking by my)
Ingesting my (ingesting my), I just wanna (I just wanna)
Sipping on my (Sipping on my), smoking on my (Smoking by my)
Ingesting my (ingesting my), I just wanna (I just wanna)

[Sample]
Pardon the, uhh, technical difficulties
Pardon the, uhh, technical difficulties

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Close my eyes and think about where I was
Before the buzz and the drugs, before the clubs and the doves
Hillbillies running from Texas, we move to the city
South Central was the home, but now my dome feel empty
When them boys tried to press me, made my heart feel itchy
Gang signs so sticky, yeah my boys hit lickies
Man I dare you to tip me
I'm addicted to risky
I'm addicted to corny
Often times it's so boring
Waking up in the morning
See the usual story
I don't wanna keep running from something that [?]
But it's easy to do, it's so easy to lose
It's a challenge to fight
I'm never done getting [?]
I'm never done hanging on
I'm never done seeing you
No matter how hard I try
It's always a sequel, sequel, sequel

[Intro]
There's not a soul in here

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your house and dump like the trash man
All up in your grill, but I'm not a fan
Merlyn, I do no hat trick, just show me where the cash at
Then show me where the hash at, fuck that
Show me where the cash at
(There's not a soul in here)
I would rather be on acid, rather make investments
They'll come out of that debt, we'll come out of those bedsheets
I'm like the IRS, pull up to your address
I was trying my best to seizure, but pull it like Keisha
(There's not a soul in here)
Johnny Dang gon' ice my diamonds, up out that freezer
I used to be broke, I don't got amnesia
I used to deal with both, now it's black victims
She know not to call collect if she go to prison
(There's not a soul in here)

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
(There's not a soul in here-)
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
(Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out)
(Now 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
At night I bring them out, I was sleeping upside-down
Keep you up, I come around, they stay right up on my tip
Send me a pic whenever you slip, hoping this outflow my scales
Full throttle whenever I blaze, fifty mil', put it under my wheel (There's not a soul in here-)
Human, I see through your eyes
Until my CCC wide open to my skin
They can see they run, they feel like they been kicking DDR
Bustin' out the bar, human of the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back (There's not a soul in here-)

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at? (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that

Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure, where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that



[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
They gon' make a leak, they gon' make a leak
Man, they ball in the summer and they fall by the spring, aye
They gon' make a leak, they gon' make a leak
Man, they ball in the summer and they fall by the spring, aye

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Break the bank and throw the money in the trash bag
If they kill me, please don't make my name a hashtag
They might steal your moment to set up a cash grab
But it's no way they maintain it if it ain't organic, gain it
No complaining in the business of obtaining what's our maintenance
Stain the glass and tint the windows so they can't see what you making off the top
Milk and honey on the rocks
Never lucky when it drops
Not your buddy or a prop
Y'all talk funny like the cops

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your house and dump like the trash man
All up in your grill, but I'm not a fan
Merlyn, I do no hat trick, just show me where the cash at
Then show me where the hash at, fuck that
Show me where the cash at
I would rather be on acid, rather make investments

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
If I told you where the dope was
You ain't supposed to be here, nigga, you don't know us
See, boy, I am focused
In my garage makin' magic, this is hocus
Goin' loco, voodoo, I sue ya
The Devil gon' get ya if it's not the ruler
My black skin made me wanna dress more cooler
Hidin' alcohol inside my family's cooler, I'm tired of life, boy
Last night I had a dream, I put that on my whiteboard
For too damn long my life was McDonald's and white boys
Now it's like white noise, I need me some nice noise
I need me some nice coin, I need me some new clout
The gang niggas turn on you, fame niggas run from you
Laughin', hold my hand, baby, when it's convenient
I need me some street shit, fuck this PC shit, ah

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Oh, oh
Yeah, I don't wanna ride
Quit wastin' my time
I don't wanna ride
Quit wastin' my time, quit wastin' my time
Quit wastin' my time, quit, quit



Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: bearface and Kevin Abstract]
Who's gonna find out? (I just know you understand, yeah, ah)
If we run away, yeah, ooh
Baby, you lift me out the struggles that I fell into
But all the crazy things that you put me through
I still wait, keep pushin'
Girl, you pushin'

[Chorus]
I'll take you, oh, forgive me too
And all my love is for you
I sing, "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye"
I'll take you, oh, forgive me too
And all my love is for you
I sing, "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye"



Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna minimize
I want a moment that end with time
I want a friend of mine to visit me like it's the wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
When I was Elio
Trippin', I'm fuckin' up every code
Holdin' my niggas 'till every broke
All of my brothers, I feel like I'm home

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Wintertime, wintertime
Remember when you were a friend of mine?
Remember when we couldn't get in line?
Now we the reason why they in the line
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
Contrary like the dew drops
In gray skies, I need new socks
'Cause I'm walkin' out with no shoes on
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
Contrary, platinum ring
One to ten, season feelings, no seasons
Wintertime, wintertime
The sky is fallin'
The sky is fallin'
That's it

[Outro: bearface]
Baby, maybe you should let me go (Yeah, yeah)
When I'm alone, oh, I always feel right
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, oh, ooh

Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Countin' all my blessings, and count my dollars
Make it [?], I'll tell you half way
If you see me at the bar take a upper hour
And I deal my many mans on my daily shower
Now they wonder why I'm trippin', I'll tell you now, bruh
Got my homies on the corner, yeah, they pushin' sour
If you see me on the club, [?]
If you beat it on the floor, I show you how it works
Show you how, show you-

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
They want the money, power-[Hook - Kevin Abstract]
Yeah yeah (Yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Who finna point me in the right direction?
Every day I feel my mistakes are a sign from heaven
I wanna move back to the block and get right back to seven
Drug dealers, candy paint, and chop and screw the message
I stay truer than true
I'm feelin' bluer than blue
I wonder what would I do if I ain't have me a group
Baby boy, look at you, why you trippin' off of school?
You should feel like a troop for the days you had to do

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You're my everything, my everything, yah



[Verse 1: Joba]
Pretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?
I don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle
That and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow
The other's gold and complemental trusty, well-well...
I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud
Burn my dress shoes in a fire with the wood
Sit back and relax with the fumes of
Everything I hate in the world
Play Mozart, smoke my cigar on
My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn
Neighbors hate, place duct tape underneath their tires
And I wait

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Sunsets to blood moon horizons
Left brain and right brain divided
Set frames and watch plays inside them
In the mountains now's where you'll find him
I smell a breeze in the morning
I feel your presence, it's warming
I paid attention to warnings
But we were too caught up in transforming

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Lucky days, I'm burnin' the four-cyl'
Your boy is dusty like brush up a fossil
Hear that shit urk like the noise of a possum
Bitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle
Built like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle
Fuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one
Come fuck with me and my dogs
Hate on my ass like in-laws, ugh
That boy stay light like a cheerleader, um
She want me filled like a two-liter, um
Eat it all day, watch it ricochet off
Then I skrrt off on that Michelin, aww
They don't got nothing on me 'til I pop
They don't got nothing on me, call the cops
I hit that run like a Heisman, boy, run it back
Look at that boy, hit that running back

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
Shout out to South Central, San Marcos
I got addicted to soft-shell tacos
Got down to pennies and ramen noodles
Now, I see how hunger make a shooter
Stamina, stamina
I used to be holding the camera
Head hit the glass, dog your window up
Fans praying to me like my handle Cortana
We like Wu-Tang, but I feel like Santana
She twerkin' just like she Hannah Montana
Head was clean, Tony Fantano
Made her my wife-uh
She can't kick it, she so Bella
Confused erections
Bad hoes know name brands, they brainless

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to

[Verse 1]
I can feel this dropping
Drunk drive and spoke to God
No fear, all that worry
And you're not moving but you want it to stop
Daydreamer, goals screenshotted
High speeds sank the sun
Gold dreams of California
So comfortable you need some trouble to cause

[Chorus]
But you don't know what you want
So I'll let go of control
'Cause I know just what you are
You're gonna break me in two, me

[Verse 2]
No falling back
I can feel this dropping
And when the wheels don't stop
Just, run me over
No dialing down now
Only realizing
We're too far forward now, oh

[Bridge]
Running out of fuel
I wanted you to hold back
Falling after something that ain't right, right
I don't feel right
Wanted you to know that you can't hold me


[Chorus]
You don't know what you want
So I'll let go of control
'Cause I know just what you are
You're gonna, you're going
You're going, you're going
Going, going

Boy, you're in a hurry
If you were lookin' at what I'm looking at, you'd be in a hurry too

Y'know how everyone's saying "seize the moment?"-
Can't you feel it?
-I dunno, I'm kinda thinking the moment seizes us



[Intro]
And you could lose yourself in this world, easy
I don't want to regret that
We never had a name for anxiety then, you said
Whatever it was made me, me
And on our bikes we used to take the shortcut through the graveyard
Now I see your father stood talking to you there for hours
And I haven't asked him how he's doing
I haven't visited 'cause I don't know what to say, honestly

[Verse 1]
Writing on a Monday morning
This week feels like a mountain
While I'm still trying to decide if its best to hide behind my eyelids
And it's cold
When you're gone you're cold
His weakness gives you strength
Not always for good
Drifting into hell
You think I can't see
It's over
Like my boy from the corner
Like mummies corolla
Like those nights in Paris
Rip them off these four walls like posters
Wonder if life is about staying true
While watching the sky change on you
Spread your wings or lose your inhibitions for a moment or two
You're floating
If we make it through this
We'll make it through anything
I spent too many night here, twisting and turning
In the corner of a corner
And when the truth capsizes
Will you blame the tide or the timing
She loves you regardless
You feel alone in the darkness
In the frame
And if the way forwards is backwards
Back down those country lanes
Back staring through that window pane
While the sun sets on all we made
The bigger picture's what we ran through
And chose to leave behind
Frustrating how the truth was the intention behind our divide

[Chorus]
'Cause she's got lots of love
And she's staring at you in the dark
She got lots of words that've been tearing you apart
Welcome to the end of the place you call home
Made hell for the highs, to try and fall through a moment
Your faithful eyes
I just want to trust like you do
Maybe I could stay there with you
The world looks so unkind from up here though
Hero

[Verse 2]
These hands are trembling
That word was heaven sent
I smashed this mirror
In one moment I reached for everything i'd ever felt
These conversations
Where we prioritise listening
Until our words are genuine and relevant
Still caught between two worlds
That raised me and framed my ambivalence
I still need that first line of space
Repeated by a stranger
I can't confide in those too close who treat help
As if it were a favour
He's outgrowing expectations and familiar faces
Witnessed you throw him to the waves
Just to try save him while he was drowning

I'm floating
If we make it through this
We'll make it through anything
I spent too many nights here twisting and turning
In the corner of a corner
And when the truth capsizes
Will you blame the tide or the timing
You love her, regardless
You feel alone in the darkness
In the frame
And if the way forwards is backwards
Back down those country lanes
Back staring through that window pane
While the sun sets on all we made
The bigger picture's what we ran through
And chose to leave behind
Frustrating how the truth was the intention was behind our divide

[Bridge]
I fell through
It feels like you
Everything
You, feel

[Chorus]
'Cause she's got lots of love
And she's staring at you in the dark
She got lots of words that've been tearing you apart
Welcome to the end of the place you call home
Made hell for the highs, to try and fall through a moment
Your faithful eyes
I just want to trust like you do
Maybe I could stay there with you
The world looks so unkind from up here though


[Verse 1]
She says I'm no good with my hands
But I'd hold up the whole sky for her
I want to forget my future and jump into the dark

[Verse 2]
I would've caused so much trouble
If I'd had you to sneak out with me
All our future's melted in your hands, they're drowning us

[Chorus]
Still I say things like, "No hindsight in 2020"
"Got my sight checked, that's precious to me"
"Can't blindside me, I'm well aware
If you were me, I'd burn this out
To the sound of the daylight slipping from me"
"All our yesterdays spent misguided, sliding'"
And now our heels worn down and self aware
With dreams of stopping

[Interlude]
You must have me messed up with somebody else
You got me mixed up
You got me stressed out
Youth spent plaited under walls, waterfalls
Walls can talk to things like
(Dreams of stopping, dreams of stopping)
(Dreams of)
You must have me messed up with somebody else
You got me mixed up
You got me stressed out
Youth spent plaited under walls, waterfalls
Walls can talk to things like


[Chorus]
Still I say things like, "No hindsight in 2020"
"Got my sight checked, that's precious to me"
"Can't blindside me, I'm well aware
If you were me, I'd burn this out
To the sound of the daylight slipping from me"
"All our yesterdays spent misguided, sliding"
And now our heels worn down and self aware
With dreams of stopping
With dreams of stoppi-
Dreams worth stopping for

[Outro]
You know, our progress is just really slow because we're trying to just find ways through

[Intro: EDEN]
Breathe deep, it ain't what you want
Next episode goes lights out
Gonna see these stars appear
Comin' up
Walkin' back I know it's not burnin'
My lungs collapsing
So what I got to fear
Now it's done

[Chorus: ATO]
The surface, I can see the surface from here
24 and checking off
The fuck I need a minute for?
My brother's back tonight though
Right, right, right, yeah
I was waiting for you right here
Yeah

[Verse 1: ATO]
Under this weight that you feel (I told you)
A shadow of guilt until you're ready to
(As the sun sets over us all)
Swallow this pill
I take too many and feel like it's nothing (Nothing)
I'm drowning in this water, supposed to make it fall easy
Keep going and you'll see me through the crowd
An Island we're all falling for something (Something)
You c-could have been mine (Mine)
Still looking for the past in the ... full of...
Say they've lived their best days, must be too afraid
I put a flower in the vase, hope it rains today
Looking at me like I'm nothing till that second keeps falling
My footsteps echo into your memory


[Chorus: ATO]
The surface, I can see the surface from here
24 and checking off
What the fuck I need a minute for?
My brother's back tonight though
Right, right, right, yeah
I was waiting for you right here
Yeah

[Verse 2: ATO]
Yo, I put this all in the open (Yeah)
Stand where you want to
I pay for the ceremony, I pay for that smile too (Yeah)
They're gonna like me, you know you're letting go now
You're gonna love me, you know I gotta go now
Tell him the truth, if he don't remember
(I said yo, for nothing)
I found my voice in this echo chamber
Fuck your help, I don't want no favours
Not now, we'll talk about it later
Claustrophobic zooming out, major
They ain't seen it like this when the lights fade in
Bad news coming in I couldn't take no time
My two worlds collide
The silence to sirens, the sirens to silence
You're in my city but it's just bad timing
There's a party tomorrow and you just might find it
Text me in the morning, say it just feels different
Too busy I missed it but we're good right? (Good right)
Promise I'll be thinking 'bout you all night
Change flight, stay or go, go or stay
This shit doesn't have no name
So if I see you in the future
We won't know what to say


[Chorus: ATO]
The surface, I can see the surface from here
24 and checking off
What the fuck I need a minute for?
My brother's back tonight though
Right, right, right, yeah
I was waiting for you right here

[Outro: ATO]
If I let reality set in now
I might have to drown in everything they offer me and Iie
I'm runnin' late, can you pick me up?
Pick me up

It's kind of like amazing that the project did have to be completed in New York
And that's sort of... it's like a very neat way of like a chapter closing I guess, or not closing, but you know, like something else beginning, but yeah for sure it's really amazing
Like to go from where you were to... a sort of emotion I guess to as sort of point where you can write about it and sing about it and sort of have a sort of have a sort of almost retrospective clarity
It's kind of... it's quite amazing lots of people, or most people will never ever have that

This series is called three-hundred and sixty-five times.
This video is called twenty.
So... Where do i begin?

I guess since this is the first time I've done this, I'll start with the basics.
You all know me as EDEN, and by the time you're watching this I will  be twenty years old.

It's funny how you don't realize how much things have changed until you've stopped to look back. I never had a euphoric moment where I thought "This is it. Everything is about to change.", no.. that doesn't happen, but still somehow, here i am three-hundred and sixty-five days later, wondering if a turning point even exists.

And, that's not to say nothing eventful has happened this year, either.
I dropped out of school, I released some music, and somehow that allowed me to travel a bit, even though I've never even played a show.
I made some new friends, and team EDEN now has more than one member, with the addition of my manager and lawyer back in Autumn.

So, what does that mean?
Am I gonna start making different music?
Absolutely not.
Is my manager gonna start posting or tweeting for me?
Absolutely not.
I mean, I started this on my own so that I could do what I want, how I want, when I want, and that's never gonna change. I own my future.
And, speaking of which, although I think this has been the most significant year of my life so far, 2015 has only scratched the surface of what I want to do.
I have more plans than you can imagine.

So, 2016....
Where do I begin?

It's been a long year. I guess most people of my 2016 has been defined by 2 things - My first ever piece of music for sale, and well, this.

['Sofie Letitre - I'll Be Fine (ZES Remix)' plays]

But really there was so much more to it than that.
I know you've probably read this in some fucking interview or something I've done or live streamed before, but like, I feel... for a long time I felt in the same place as End Credits, you know?
And so... I think you think too much of me is one way to get around that, but I really... You know, I just want to regress, I don't feel like I have - I'm halfway there but it's like 'shit I haven't really been doing anything for the last year.' And I've been saying I've been doing a shit ton but like, in terms of... I don't know.
The fall of last year I've been living in my fucking head 1000 miles in the sky not really 'in it' I guess. It's good to just get back down to earth. Wow that's really fucking... hipster or whatever, you know what I mean.
In terms of music though honestly it's been kind of hit and miss. I feel like I got a lot of cool shit I want to make and say, but it's - I don't think I'm in the right place right now.
Like I'm having cool ideas that I know and like a lot of shit that I want to achieve, and I mean like things I want to say but I don't think I'm in the right place right now. So I'm cool with just kicking it back and laying it easy. I just don't feel like it's connecting fully right now. I'm not even back for like 2 weeks and I was gone all in the last week and I'd be gone in London again in the next week, so I'm not really in the zone. Just gonna grow up a bit in the next month or two or four or five or whatever and it'll happen eventually. I don't know. Buuuuuuut I forget what else I was gonna say.


[start//end music video behind the scenes intro]
So, I can- are you recording?
Yeah
So, I can, wait for focus, and- *clap*
And now you can press play if you want
But I'm still putting it in
Yeah
You're dead wrong ('cause I feel like I need to crash)
It's kind of taking me back to like, ah, pick it up (what are we doing?)
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong
This will kinda take long, fuck, okay
And I got-

[Monologue]
Recently, in an interview, someone asked me, uh, "What are the three most important things that have happened to you this year?"
Um, I can't fully remember what I said, but, I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, um, "Finishing my album, moving to New York, and, the sh- the live shows I played."
Um, I've been thinking about that question for a while now, though, um, and that those three answers were maybe along the right lines, but, only like half-truths.
Um, finishing my album was important, but, for me, it was, you know, like, bigger than just the submission of some songs that I made in my bedroom.
Um, it's the bookend to a large part of my life, uh, you know-things have been on my mind in some cases probably for too long, um, and in the same way moving to New York was amazing, but, really, it was me jumping out of my comfort zone for a while.
Leaving the people and places and the culture that I had known my whole life behind, even, you know, just for a second.
Um, it wasn't really the live shows I played that were important, but more so, some of the things I learnt while out there.
Uh, I realized I wasn't taking myself into consideration; I was playing shows to please people and to entertain them, and forgot to make sure that I enjoyed it. Um, that I got to feel something more than, used afterwards. Um, and it was just a small shift of mindset but I'm so much better for it.
Um, it seems simple, but it took me a year and a half of touring to, to get it, and it only really happened at the very end of it.
But, most importantly, on tour, I saw another artist in a similar position. Um, I won't say who it was but I had finished performing and went to see someone much bigger than me.
And just before their set started, I saw them sitting down, uh, right beside the steps to their stage, you know, like, moments before one of the most energetic performances I saw this summer.
And they were sitting, hood up, and on their phone. You know, alone, uh, honestly looking quite down, or lost.
I didn't talk to them, but weirdly it was a relief knowing that it wasn't just me, um, that I wasn't the only one.
So I think I should tell you this. This album has been for me since I first started thinking about working on it, years ago.
Um, it just been a catalyst of change in so many ways for me, um, and it's taught me so much more about myself than I ever thought it would.
Um, I made vertigo by myself, for myself, um, but it, but it's finished now.
So, maybe it could be for you.
I have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly.

[Father]
I always wonder why birds choose to stay in
the same place when they could fly
anywhere on earth
- I then ask myself the same.

[Unknown]
i think it doesnt matter if youre aware of it
or not
how tidal everything seems
that one day you might stand on paradise
not move and soon be drowning

[Rosie Ashley]
or how some things you left behind
wait for you in your hotel room, some place
for latent change
to be reclimbed, reassembled
and unknotted

for me to say anything i must first have
listened
for you to find anything you have to look

[Unknown]
even in some small way
As above so below
the blue, the blue, and blue
Running, tripping, falling

[Florian Vasquez]
it was kind of like waking up from a dream
those lifelike episodes
you second guess yourself wondering
if any of it actually happened

[Fatme Bostandzhieva]
The last forever in third person
A chase cam rolling with the current
Pushed, moved,
and pulled out of view

[Mother, Ato Alexander]
and ive been thinking about a change of
pace
or the pace of change
or how the last few years were a singularity
you were the universe folding in on itself

[Ato Alexander]
information bleeds
no name
no location
no frame of reference
Running, tripping, falling
Just echos and a sense that something had
happened here

[Jonathon Ng]
unsure of what it was i turned around and
carried on

[Monologue]
I didn't really know what to say, um, so I thought I'd build a road, um
When I was like 12, I started making beats on my family computer
Um, by the time I was 15 I'd stolen it to my attic bedroom and I was, I was hooked
Um, I started putting the things I made online, that's The Eden Project, and just didn't stop
I never sent them anywhere, or even told my friends, but I just put them out there
Um, like, endless music for like three years and it just grew and grew
Um, I think I was luckily just in a cusp of a wave, really
Suddenly music could be produced by anyone with a computer and I just happened to be early
But suddenly, something crystallized, in winter of like 2014, and I knew I had something to say, and I knew what shape it was, finally
Um, so when End Credits was released in 2015 for free, a couple of interesting things started to happen
It was downloaded from my site about 15,000 times in a couple days
And I knew I had a fanbase, um, but, I'd never seen it in like a central number like that
It was spread across whatever uploads or songs, and, my first monthly payment, um, from having music on Spotify early that year was like 42 dollars and 62 cent
Which quickly grew into enough to support me, and a career of music, or at least an attempt of one
Um, and then suddenly after End Credits there's just more emails than I could handle, I had multiple meetings with various record labels, publishers, managers, lawyers, um, daily for about six weeks
Um, I was definitely in over my head but at least secure because I had money coming in, you know?
I could, I could say no
So I told everyone no, um, aside from my current manager and eventually the Astralwerks team, later, about a year later in 2016
I started, I started touring and everything just got bigger and bigger, I played to like 200 people for free in London, and then 450 paid tickets the same year
And I think, next time I played in London it was for 2,400 people
All three shows sold out really quickly, it was, I couldn't keep up with myself at all, basically
Um, I don't think I allowed myself to stop and enjoy anything, I was just hyper focused on going, you know, just forward
Going on tour, whatever, I was just moving, um
And in a weird way it was for the best and uhh, and for the worst, because, because of the work I put in I have a career, you know, doing what I love, which is one of the greatest things I could ever ask for
But, um, I definitely lost myself to it all, and I lost, I lost an [?] that I saw when I was 17
So, fast forward to 2019, I just, I spent as much time at home as I possibly could, um, I flew as little as I could, um
And it's still an ongoing process, I kinda just stripped all the things I built up away from underneath me to, to find the road, um, or at least try to
Um, I had some of the best times of my life this year, and some of the worst
Um, I said goodbye to a friend too soon
Um, I made some really difficult choices and, I, well I let myself cry about it which is, important, you know?
Um, now at the end of it all, um, I feel like I'm starting to see myself again, um
The present is a platform, build as you see fit, um
No plans, only godspeed
No future, only ideas
And we've made it this far

[Outro]
Ten tonne, ballast on my chest
As I woke up, a heavy inhale
For the nights-

[Verse 1]
So hold on if you want
I don't wanna play this, no
I don't have the patience
And last year was a long one
And these days are reruns
A fine time for a breakdown
Let's find words to tear these walls down
And I threw them all away
If I start then I probably won't stop
'Cause the world moves on and the lights stay on
For the next one, and next one, it's an ocean
No, I don't wanna waste forever
But I can if I want to
There's so much that can change my mind
So much of me has changed, how could I ever feel the same?

[Chorus]
So dive in, to my home
It's all I have, woah (Coming up for the weekend, running as far as we can)
So drive me, 'till the shore
Spoken like a real life savior
NASCAR, we're just racing in circles again
(We'll get it right for the next time)

[Verse 2]
Bleed out, it's a cold night
City views killed the starlight
Sleeping at the wheel for the first time
It's terrifying when you wake up
A few years later it's a new time
Hard to see how it stands from the inside
Inside, it's tried if it's tiring
You then, leave

[Chorus]
So dive in, to my home
(Cassini don't come home, you don't want to say it)
It's all I have, woah (And I don't want to know, but I feel it, I feel)
(Coming up for the weekend, running as far as we can)
So drive me, 'till the shore
(And I don't want to be here, but I don't want to go)
Spoken like a real life savior ('Cause I need it)
NASCAR, we're ju-

[Outro]
The lone and level sands stretch far away

[Intro: ATO & EDEN]
Three, four...
Back to serious voice

[Verse 1]
The frame ain't the same no more is it
I painted this picture and let the words reflect my image
Sometimes the truth hurts
Like the first line of this verse
I expected too much
Thinking they were just like me
I've got to start being selfish
Helping others left me helpless
When a river meets the stream
'Til the sky falls to its knees
And I could sit here for hours
This perspective
Trespassing thoughts
Behind locked doors
That belong to thrown away keys
You see
Needing me or need me not
Dictates your smile
Falling into lines like I ain't heard from you in a while
I'll be whoever you want
Providing you put your mind to it
Try'na buy my freedom
Should it afford my pride
I wish I could believe you
But I can't
There's too much on my plate
Pour me another glass
Drowning in these sorrows
'Till I found peace with my past
Drawn into a world where the flower is defined by the vase
And that's young me by the windowsill
With questions that view can't answer
Guess it's too early to say
If what we've made are mistakes
You just wanna
Lose your mind to find your soul
I just need to
See the world before I call this home
I used to run riot when I was young
Confused, try'na distinguish where someone like me belongs
When did I become the man
The cool kid, I was never that

[Chorus]
When they've learnt to love you for all but yourself
Your deluded wealth undermines your coming so far
Shattered glass
Family portrait suddenly finds the present
As we pick the past up
And recall it as heaven
It's never seemed so insignificant
Everything you worked for
Too precious to enjoy
Ourselves we avoid
These thoughts we employ
Too much noise
We just listen for the silence
That sits between the sirens

[Refrain]
And I just found a place that no-one else knows
Watch the sky reach 'til it lets go
I've never been afraid to close my eyes before
They'll paint you how they want to in the end
I knew that you'd show
Been caught up where you found me before
Wanna go
Somewhere only we would know

[Verse 2]
You said "I thought I told you to stop dreaming"
But your reality never gave me the reason
To stop believing
I chose the darkest path
To emancipate my own feelings
Clouding the vision
Distorting the meaning
I mean its clearer now than ever
Growing up under pressure
Nothing's ever promised
A slave for the word better
If you see me you don't know me
Stop pretending
You never attended
Not to mention
I was left to put to bed all of my questions

[Bridge]
But I'll sleep on it
Dream bigger
New frame of mind
The bigger picture
Fingers travel scriptures
'Till we capsize
I'ma keep running
We sinning
Pushed back to the beginning
The past speaking to me like a family 20 minute visit
Dreamt of this line last night
Stood at some height
Over the city, prepared to leave all these memories behind
Compromised by my desire to make it all on my own
You'll begin to sink in when you're stone
Yeah, we need a comparative perspective to be free
Happy despite all that you haven't seen
Scared to look for answers
'Cause you know what they might be
94 Dreaming
Still looking for a mirror that I believe in

[Refrain]
And I just found a place that no-one else knows
Watch the sky reach 'till it lets go
I've never been afraid to close my eyes before
They'll paint you how they want to in the end
I knew that you'd show
I've been caught up where you found me before
Wanna go
Somewhere only we could know

[Chorus]
When they've learnt to love you for all but yourself
Your deluded wealth undermines your coming so far
Shattered glass
Family portraits suddenly finds the present
As we pick the past up
And recall it as heaven
It's never seemed so insignificant
Everything you worked for
Too precious to enjoy
Ourselves we avoid
These thoughts we employ
Too much noise
We just listen for the silence
That sits between the sirens

[Outro]
Parallel


[Verse]
I ran away last night, in my dreams
Oh, my dreams, they keeping me awake, yeah
Came crashing through the rain
Half light on a turnpike
One-forty make those guard rails float nice
I couldn't float right
Show me the way
To slow down, down, yeah
Slow down, down, down
Slow down, down
Slow, slow down

[Outro]
I found a way last night, in my dreams
Oh, my dreams, they keeping me awake, yeah
Came crashing through the rain
Half light on a turnpike
One-forty make those guard rails float nice
Learning to float right
Loving the wave
Loving the wave
Loving the-


Sex, drugs, and rock & roll
Is all I want
Something more than superficial
Is all I want
The sound of the words you know
Is all I want
Sex, drugs, and rock & roll
Is all I want

Whoa-oa


[Intro]
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Ooo, oh
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Verse 1]
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy, ooo

[Verse 2]
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
(Nothing you can't...)
There's no one you can save that can't be saved
(Saved...)
There's nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you
It's easy, yeah

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love, love
Love is all you need

[Outro]
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
Love is all you need
Love is all I need
Love is all I need
Love is all I need


[Verse 1]
And just one moment
Is all I ask for
Just one talk between us
And just one second now
Some perfect clarity
And eighty hours alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore to god that I wouldn't cry
And I swore to you I can't see
How it's anything more than a lie

[Chorus]
And all these years
I won't ever let them go
All my fears
They'll bring me down, down so low
And I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn to dust

[Verse 2]
So I'll get on fine
My mind turned inside out
I've always found it easy
To hide these thoughts of mine
A collapsing state of mind
I'll sink to where thoughts can't find me


[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore to god that I wouldn't cry
And I swore to you I can't see
How it's anything more than a lie

[Chorus]
And all these years
I won't ever let them go
All my fears
They'll bring me down, down so low
And I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn, to turn

[Verse 3]
And we all hurt
And time heals nothing at all
Decisions made and they cut me off
From all I've ever known
And I can't think
No, I can't breathe
I can't be what I want to with this weight on me

[Bridge]
I wish I had
Selective amnesia
To keep you away from me


[Chorus]
But I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn to dust



[Verse 1]
And this is just another sad song
I can't deny that I've been needing one
And that the world is always at fault
And we did nothing, how did we do wrong?
And I've been thinking that when we thought
The world would break us that we weren't wrong
But it's just never been the world outside
And sonder kinda has me terrified

[Verse 2]
And I'm so sorry I can't find the time
Spent all my days over-preoccupied
And I've been thinkin' 'bout how I'd react
If you were me and I was ghosted out
And I know I should try more
But I've been so caught in my own small shit that I can't see
Past the nothing around me here

[Outro]
But I've been trying really fuckin' hard not to try so hard
Really fuckin' hard to just let go
Really fuckin' hard not to try so hard
And realize I've nowhere left to go


[Verse 1]
But she was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Oh mama, what do you mean I am the one?"
She said I am the one
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Go and dance on the floor in the round
(I don't even know if I can tell you)

[Pre-Chorus]
And the people always told me, be careful what you do
And don't you go round breaking young girls' hearts
My mother always told me, be careful who you love
And be careful what you do because a lie becomes a truth

[Chorus]
And Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
So take my strong advice
(Don't think twice) Don't think twice
She told me, "Baby, we'd danced 'till three"
Then she looked at me
She showed me a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
Go and dance on the floor in the round


[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, be careful what you do
And don't you go around breaking young girls' hearts
But she came and stood right by me
And she smelled of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she brought me to her room, yeah

[Chorus]
And Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
But the kid is not my son
(Son)
She says I am the one



[Intro]
Yeah but do you think it matters what people think?
I don't bother caring about what people think

[Chorus : EDEN & ATO]
Running round the city
Running through my thoughts (Change my memory)
Rolling in the deep end
Finding all we've lost (You told me that it would be)
Holding on so fleeting
Falling in the dark (I don't even feel that way)
Blocks holding up the ceiling (Should catch up)
Blue lights far below
Blue lights far below (Do you remember?)
Blue lights far- (Do you remember what it- Remember what it was like? He should)

[Verse 1 : ATO]
Just poured my head and my mask in
You see the light, you're the darkness
Light up the city, I left the bedside on
Still darkness giving my light wings
We opposite sides of the same thing
Blue, white red and it's waving
Da ta ta tay take, till it hits right
All turns white then it's back to black

Can't keep all these thoughts in head
Made me think twice, I can't forget
Made me think twice, ah wipe the sweat
It's all ahead

Influence slips off my open mind
The Waterfall
Puddle at my feet
Keep walking
The fading frame to the coffee clubbing, meet n greets

Word, Old shadows are tall
Man lost his life his boy lost more
Scar to the dome
Foot to the floor
In this life ain't shit to wait for
I could have sworn I seen him before
You from round here?
You sure are you sure
Zoom out a moment
Through heaven and more
Tell that kid run
Till he can't no more
I ain't looked back for 10 years that's us
Fuck their wall all made of glass
Keep going forward, outrunning the past
Past your moment past your chance
Odds stacked against
My voice stretch far
X marked the spot
Rip it apart
This is England
We can't see jack
What you saying
You think you're all that

[Chorus : EDEN & ATO]
Running 'round the city (So many [?])
Running through my thoughts (Sometime)
Rolling in the deep end (So much going on)
Finding all we've lost ([?] goin' somewhere)
Holding on so fleeting (Wish it just)
Falling in the dark (Go away)
Blocks holding up the ceiling (Figure out shit)
Blue lights far below ([?] perspective)
Blue lights far below
Blue lights far-

[Verse 2 : ATO]
Yo (D'ya forget?)
I saw the breakthrough before I heard it
Hell surrounds these churches
Poverty, preys it's lurking
Mothers pray for the youngest, cry for the oldest
The moment's gone, try hold it
But there ain't no mercy
Life moves on, the rents 850
Run for the train, why the fuck it leave early?
Have to order this cab back to Burley
My Boy said he's short
I spotted him 30
Mum's calling
I'll call you in 30
Shit, I hope that the test came back fine
Rain taps on the side of the cab
Driver keeps making eye contact
Yo, just drop me at the lay
Hold that change
It's pissing it down now
This feeling again
Watch the panic set in
Sweaty palms
Caught in a daze
I can't explain
Ain't felt this in months
Phone going off in my pocket like a siren
Almost at the flat, where my keys, I can't find em
Tight jaw, feeling it tighten
Don't look down boy, boy keep climbing
Four walls deep black and they're rising
Devil's whispers, reminders
Of everything you've been hiding
Or just can't face
Move past faces
Running still sideways
Took the stairs
Can't find the breaks
Imagine they saw me like this
Third time I feel the keys in my pocket must have missed before
Hand up to the door
Shaking more
Open it, slam it
Slowly drop to the-

[Chorus : EDEN]
Running 'round the city
Running through my thoughts
Rolling in the deep end
Finding all we've lost
Holding on so fleeting
Falling in the dark
Blocks holding up the ceiling
Blue lights far below
Blue lights far below
Blue lights far-

[Outro]
I'm fine
Yeah it was a good day, it's good

[Verse]
Runnin' on empty
I waited years in a past life
Runnin' out of rope and the waters high
I drowned for you and I didn't regret it
Text me back in the afterlife
Needed the time didn't realise
I had it all along, can't take my own advice
Conflated, fillin' the gaps for love

[Chorus]
And it's obvious
That I'm caved in and breaking up
But I know it's gone
I know it's gone
But what's over now
In my dreams you call me back
But I hope you don't
I hope you don't

[Verse]
I hope you're gone off to better days
I been watching the time, how it erodes away
Thinkin' 'bout how the last years feel like yesterday
How did I lose grip on it
Honest
Been fallin' through nightmares, light years away
And doin' my best to keep those thoughts at bay
Finding my highlights are the loudest places
And strangers faces
Getting caught up in a race of it
And walking through the clearing ground
If we took our chances
And we exchanged glances, yeah
Call it in a moment
And walking down the road that I grew up on
And fallin' out of habits
Stop pleading for empathy

[Chorus]
(?) it's obvious
That I'm caved in and breaking up
But I know it's gone
I know it's gone
But what's over now
In my dreams you call me back
But I hope you don't
I hope you don't

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I don't need you to tell me
I don't need you to tell me
'Cause I
I don't need you to tell me
No I don't need you to tell me

[Verse]
It's okay I'm going
I'm searching
For what I am now
I'll find you if it's urgent
Or if I'm hurtin'
More than I am now
And we'll come back here some day
And laugh about it
Memories that don't recall
How it felt like I was burnin'
While you weren't watchin'
Took everything I loved
No nowhere feels like home
Home
No nowhere feels like home
Home
No nowhere feels like home
Home

[Verse]
Reflections
Of my dash aligning stars over shoulder
Inflections
Tell me you don't really mean what you say
That you were in love, love, love
(I don't want it, baby, I keep falling)
You're screaming and bursting heads
Breathing corrupted air (Tell me I'm back at it since)
Your cigarette's going out, dear
(Help me down, I can't sleep)
Mayfair and lip fillers
Heartbreak and coke dealers
You were in love, love, love (It's cold feet)
But since you're on your way out
Living fast, I capsize amazed now
Leave a message when you go
(You leaving, leave me out, me out)
I, I had a dream that you wanted me
I still see you with my eyes closed
I don't think you understand how brilliant you burned
Does your past feel complete now I'm here?
Versions of another version you've seen
When I calm down
I'll be long gone

[Outro]
Just stop

[Verse]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
Falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows (Like a river flows)
Surely to the sea (Surely to the sea)
Darling, so it goes
Some things are made to be

[Verse]
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you
For I can't help
Falling in love with you

[Verse 1]
Of course I'm scared
Would I be thinking straight if I wasn't?
Of course I'm scared sometimes
Even if I say it don't phase me
Or if I say I'm not hazy
But drowning ain't so bad
'Cause at least you know where you're going
And we're all future bound
So I guess that's really the same thing

[Chorus]
But I always liked the thought of maybe being a runaway
I could be your lover and you could be my heartache
I could sing the songs that we used to sing when we were kids
Maybe that could bring us back to before we got stuck in that place

[Verse 2]
I want to be like John Dillinger
Just try and catch me if you can
And we could drive off in the sunset
Even if it's not the plan
'Cause plans are overrated
'Cause you never really know where you're going
And the past is always changing
Ain't been gold since I remembered it that way

[Chorus]
But I always liked the thought of maybe being a runaway
I could be your lover and you could be my heartache
And I could sing the songs that we used to sing way back when
The future wasn't everything and we lived because we loved it then
Oh, I'm going back
Catch me if you can


She says I'm distant
But I can't be present here
Complacency is your currency I can't afford
If dreaming is greater than its fruition
We can all live to dream of what may or may never happen

[Verse 1]
And if I told you how this story ends
Would you change a step you take?
And if I could relive all of my days
I'd live them all the same
'Cause I'm scared
Of all that I don't know
'Cause I want it all, but all of it ain't gold
And I'm scared
But I know it's not for long
'Cause I'm learning what I should've long before

[Chorus]
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Is time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight
A lifetime in repeat

[Verse 2]
But I still find solace
When you say
That you know how I feel
When it's wrong
And we ain't been right for years
And let go
Give these ghosts a new home
And let's bury our past and our fears and all these bones
And let's go
I should've seen it long before
'Cause this is my life
I will not run in circles
Ending where I start

[Bridge]
So hold on to me
We'll burn out slowly
And feel our hearts leap
To words we don't mean

[Verse 3]
Love
Means nothing to me
'Cause I don't know what it is
I'm just dying to be
All that I've been dreaming of
And words betray me
Contradict all I stand for
But I'm still learning
Yeah, I'm still learning

[Chorus]
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Just time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight
We're falling to our knees

[Verse 1]
Talking intentions over actions
Brothers trust me with a passion
Unafraid to tell them the truth
Whatever the repercussions
I'm living for clarity
I've been way too close to the edge
To live for a salary
Walk the past like a gallery
Mothers calling my phone
This bout to be a long call
Get to asking me about women, I can no longer vouch for
Thoughts on my mind
Let em sink in the wine
I'm tryna be transparent
You can't negotiate with time
I'ma be here for you
That's a good enough excuse
For me to embrace the chaos
That falls below the blue
Still love me for my flaws
I fell through yours
Found each other in each other
I'm afraid to give you more
Unsure what I believe in
I needed a way to let go of all of my Demons
Pursuing love
But still ain't found someone to give me reason
To give this up
I'd never settle for less than the feeling
I'm dreaming of

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma keep it the way I wrote it
Only authentic
These questions are cliff hangers
I'll have to close my eyes
They listen, they know it's real
They know how I feel
Sometimes I float in the ink
Until these words sink
Anxieties that I had
Made me the stronger man
Looking in your eyes
Like a galaxy I understand
The devil's tryna tempt me
But my fathers got a bigger plan
Walking back through your footsteps
To the motherland

[Chorus]
Coz when I feel the first raindrop
I'ma look up, and don't fade away
And I heard you don't believe
In the things you used to say to me
Coz when I feel the first raindrop
I'ma look up, and don't fade away
And I heard you don't believe
In the things you used to say to me

[Verse 2]
My feet dangle over my comfort zone
All these rappers clones
Hard to see their heart through the facade they feel obliged to show
Spend some time up
Then I'm low
Let the feelings go
She just wanna rush
I move slow
So I'm not involved
Sometimes I'm off then I'm on
But my brothers stay
Sometimes I sin
Follow faith
But I always pray
Live like anything can happen, nothing is taken for granted
Don't mean I won't take a risk
But won't pick apples in this garden
Brothers want it for themselves
But it's bigger than me
I'll be living for you
15 consecutive weeks
Turning pages that question what you know I'm destined to be
And then I'm back on the music
Bars ruthless
Straight truth
I'll draw anyone out when I paint my past in the booth
Why are they acting, like I don't read between lines for a living
I could see the snake in you when it was smiles and finger clicking
My brothers know it's real
Judge a friend by how they moved in the past
Intentions glow in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma keep it the way I wrote it
Only authentic
These questions are cliff hangers
I'll have to close my eyes
They listen, they know it's real
They know how I feel
Sometimes I float in the ink
Until these words sink
Anxieties that I had
Made me the stronger man
Looking in your eyes
Like a galaxy I understand
The devil's tryna tempt me
But my fathers got a bigger plan
Walking back through your footsteps
To the motherland

[Chorus]
Coz when I feel the first raindrop
I'ma look up, and don't fade away
And I heard you don't believe
In the things you used to say to me
Coz when I feel the first raindrop
I'ma look up, and don't fade away
And I heard you don't believe
In the things you used to say to me

Fuck..

[Verse 1]
Faded along the way
It can't all be on the wave
Though I'm falling now, don't take what you don't need
Belated by-the-ways
Is too late the price I pay?
Though it's over now, don't say what you don't mean

[Chorus]
Tangled in the back seat
Melting through the taxi
Cali is bending around me (Yeah)
What was it you said?
Feels hollow and I can't speak
Always been about me
Can't lie to you, I've cold feet
Waiting on kairos now

[Bridge]
'Cause I can only see so far
Staying awake like it's a lost cause
And I don't feel the least bit tired
Talking to you
You said this ain't you, but being straight, I got

[Verse 2]
Infatuated along the way
It can't all be on the wave
Though I'm falling now, don't take what you don't need (Yeah)
Belated by-the-ways
Is too late the price I pay?
Though it's over now, don't say what you don't mean

[Chorus]
Still, we were tangled in the back seat
Melting through the taxi
Cali was bending around me
What was it you said?
Pressure when you can't see
Only think about me
Can't lie to you, I've cold feet
Where does that leave us now?

[Intro]
It's been a few years since you been gone
There's been a few tears, but that was years and years ago
Yeah, I grew up to be exactly what you wanted
Yeah, I've been living out the dream that you dreamt up
It's been a few years with more to come
It's been a few years since I've felt sure of what I want
And I woke up today and found that you were waiting here for me and I thought
Woah, old friend, it's bittersweet
But how could you do this to me?
How could you do this to me?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
'Cause you are not who you think you are
There's no grain on these brown eyes
But they can be green if they really want
And I can bend your words
So they say exactly what hurts the most
But silence is better than fake laughs or faking we're always up
Loose grip
The world bends around you
And living through cracked screens
We fold down to what we want
Out of love
We talk through lines, we're made of smoke
And just in time, we drift away
Diffusing light, confusing times
Growing up, or cascading down?
Cascading down
I'm hurting now

[Verse 2]
But change comes slow
If you hate what's in your head, the fuck would you speak your mind?
In search of lost time
Just 21, so I'm young and I'm stupid
Only 16, yeah, I think you should've known
I think you fucked me up
I think, I think you fucked me up
And I've got nothing to say to you

[Outro]
It's been a few years and I moved on
Couldn't make it disappear, oh I tried so hard to be strong
But I grew up today and faced that I'm not just lonely
Don't feel much better but I guess that it's a start




[Intro]
So tell me what it is that you want, that-, that you don't have

[Verse 1]
Contemplating everything
I'm questioning who I am and these walls I'm living in
I might scream but they won't hear this hurricane
That's some love I mix with pain
That's some shit won't be the same
That's some rain that comforts me on these walks I take outside the frame
Yeah, yeah
I'm so used to the cycle
I don't really tell nobody
I'm close to the edge and I might fall
Running from something years ago
I don't even know how to slow down
I'm anticipating a crossroads
And I'm asking God where to turn now
It's three in the morning
And I do this every day
My thoughts get lost in this dark room
'Til the sunrise washes them all away
I heard there's beauty in the struggle
I heard it's sweet, it's subtle
Light pours down this tunnel
Run until I lose my shadow
I may just trip on some faith in here
Thought I was running for light
But in truth, I was running in fear
This was never how it used to be
I loved you before I learned to love me
I tried to confide in friends but they taught me that that was naive
Taught me to cover my sleeves and fall on my knees
And to look up in the sky in need

[Refrain]
Run, run, run
I'm trying to find me, yeah
Made it to the river edge
Trying to find some peace, yeah
Watching a black sky
Turn into a butterfly
Fly, fly, fly away
Letting go of yesterday
And I ain't never seen it like this
Never seen it like this before
And God, if I changed my mind, I would never see this I'm sure
I ain't never seen it like this
Never seen it like this before
God if I changed my mind, if I changed my mind, I would never see this I'm sure

[Verse 2]
We visit in a derelict past
Wiping the dust off this glass
This mirror shows me at nine years old
Looking back at me so hard
Where've you been?
Why'd you leave me behind?
I've been shouting for you all night
I've been calling 'til the sunrise washes me from the back of your mind, oh
Yeah
And I thought you would never come
Thought you would never be here
Looking in this broken mirror, everything's so clear
I didn't think I'd find you either
Not sure what I was searching for
Wiping the mirror with the tears I've been holding for years
Then it turned into a window when we watched it pour
When I'm old I wanna be somewhere real
You told me when I'm old I wanna be someone real
I don't really wanna end up like you
I just wanna find somebody that feels like me
Feeling to sail away
I'm gon' find me a better place
Somewhere they see me before they see my race
Somewhere I don't need to hide away
These friends aren't friends 'til they shared your hardest days
Your hardest time, your coldest place
You can come if you want to
You can come if you want to
We can still be okay
I got nothing but some thoughts on you
Watched it rain
But if I run 'round, take it all on, be a good son
Would it be alright?
Would it be alright?
Be alright, yeah
And lately I don't know what to do
I got nothing but some thoughts on you
But if I run 'round, take it all on, be a good son
Would it be alright?
Would it be alright?
Would it be alright?

[Refrain]
Run, run, run
Trying to find me
Made it to the river edge
Trying to find some peace
Watching a black sky
Turn into a butterfly
Fly, fly, fly away
Letting go of yesterday
And I ain't never seen it like this
Never seen it like this before
God, if I changed my mind, I would never see this I'm sure
I ain't never seen it like this
Never seen it like this before
God if I changed my mind, if I changed my mind, I would never see this I'm sure

[Outro]
"So tell me what it is that you want, that-, that you don't have"
"Well I'd like to be, I'd like to be more consistently here, you know? I'd like to really get on a ro-...
I'd like to just, and I know it's not probably ever, maybe, possible but
Because it's so improbable, and so impossible, I'd just like to really see how long I could last as being really here, you know?
Really in it, really alive in the moment, you know?"


Aight-
Yeah, what was that gonna-
Ooh aah hey

[Chorus]
I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
What the fuck, babe?
I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
What the- huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
All dipped in Prada
Lookin' for a problem
Sorry baby pardon me
You just took a part of me
When you gon' apologise
You be lookin' so bad
It be makin' me so mad
This is not for me ever since

[Chorus]
I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
What the fuck, babe?
I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful


[Verse 2]
Oh
Cha- cha- change you change for me
Look at all this damage you take from me
Even all this hurt you take from me
I don't recall the last time you said that I
Fucked up for real
Got you like I got your bills
I'm the one that changed the rules
And you ain't ever been the same ever since I

[Chorus]
I left you alone, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' ungrateful
What the hell, babe?
I left you alone, no, no, no (Yeah)
Huh, yeah, [?]
Oh, I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
What the f---, babe?

[Outro]
I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful

[Instrumental]


[Intro]
Do you still think of it?
Find some peace inside your bed
You were sleeping on my shoulder like you don't know
Got no case, let my phone crack
'Cause some things aren't built to last
So how long 'til I can stop dreaming about you now

[Chorus]
'Cause it was a fear
Something that I said and can't take back
We laid in the night air and talked it down
But it was fading
Maybe we're two keen
Loving it arcane, no holding back
If you could be here now when you turn back
And tell me something
So tell me something

[Bridge]
I'll keep you safe in my mind until it's gone
Maybe it changed with the time
And you don't feel it out though
Yet you said you'd call
But I told you I would be coming back soon
Now I don't
Now I don't know

[Verse]
But I still think of it
You skipped work and we stayed in
And I was thinking maybe something was happening
We watched the light die from your terrace
You told me 'bout your ex
A crush you had for years and
The life you used to hate
You asked how this would end
But we'd only just met
I can't stop thinking about it now

[Chorus]
'Cause it was a fear
Something that I said and can't take back
We laid in the night air and talked it down
But it was fading
Maybe we're two keen, yeah
Just loving it arcane, no holding back
If you could be here now I'd pull you back
And ask you something
Ask you something

[Outro]
Do you still think of it?
'Cause I see echoes of how it felt
That you were sleeping on my shoulder that you don't know
But no case to hit you back
'Cause some things aren't built to last
So how long 'til I can stop dreaming about you now


[Verse]
Why do me like that?
No, you can't take it back
I meant what we attract
Can't lie, it's facts

[Chorus]
I'm dreaming of the past
Chances, they've passed
Moulded your own cast
Emotions, high contrast

[Bridge]
Dreaming of the past
(Dreaming of the past, of the past)
Dreaming of the past
(Dreaming of the past, of the past)

[Verse]
Why do me like that?
No, you can't take it back
I meant what we attract
Can't lie, it's facts

[Chorus]
I'm dreaming of the past
Chances, they've passed
Moulded your own cast
Emotions, high contrast

[Verse 1]
'Cause I had the best of the worst sides
And I had these lungs, ohh
And I had too many flashbacks
That I just let them burn

[Pre-Chorus]
'Till my chest is on fire
And my head just won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like it's move or slowly die
You say, "You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you and you know it"
But ain't that just the point?

[Interlude]
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm so caught below, and I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
Whatever you wanted
But not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I wanted
Or maybe I need it
Swear lying's the only rush I need


[Verse 2]
'Cause all I needed was some words to say
That all these feelings don't mean shit to me
'Cause it's all just chemicals anyway, anyway, yeah
And I got way too many routes to take
To make this all just go away
And find another heart to break
So heartless with these words I say
Just saying what I'm supposed to say
'Cause I had nothing for you
I can't love when I can't even love myself
Things I would rather be thoughts at the back of my head
But I'm addicted to hurting
And I got these lungs
And I spent too many late nights
Just thinking a hole in the earth

[Pre-Chorus]
'Till the sky is on fire
And my head still won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like I need something to come alive
She said, "You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you, what you doing?"
And I said, "That's the point"


[Interlude]
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm so caught below, and I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
Whatever you wanted, but not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
'Cause I'm a fucking mess inside
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I want it
Or maybe I need it
Swear lying's the only rush I need

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh yeah, I need it
Yeah, I need it, I need it I need it, I need it, yeah

[Intro]
I dunno, I just remember it being so much brighter I guess

[Verse 1: EDEN]
Cigarette ash like wildfire
Burning holes in the nighttime
Open scars feel like barbed wire
White lies flying high like a ceasefire
Dropping flags on the shoreline
This is as far as I can feel right
'Cause what you don't know
Can haunt you

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN & Leah Kelly]
And all we ever wanted
Was sunlight and honesty
Highlights to wanna repeat
Let's get away from here and
Live like the movies do
I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think for a while

[Interlude]
(Don't drag it out, living like that doesn't mean a thing)

[Chorus: EDEN & Leah Kelly]
So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause happy endings hardest to fake
Yeah


[Verse 2: EDEN & Leah Kelly & Both]
Sunsets on power lines
Making a break for the other side
Heading out to where that sunshine
45 millimeter rolling like we lost time
Polaroids and OutKast
Rather burnout young than grow up fast
And we could be forever future bound
'Cause all I need is time and now
And I could leave this past behind me
(And all we ever wanted was)
And maybe I'll see a way for me to stay
(Sunshine and honesty highlights)
When there's so much out there
(To wanna repeat let's get away from here and)
So I'll live forgetting for the time being
(Live like the movies do)
And I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think for a while

[Chorus: EDEN & Leah Kelly]
So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause everything was never the same


[Bridge: EDEN]
And I wanna let you know
I wanna let you go
But I just can't bring myself to speak
But this is how it goes
The end credits, they roll
This bridge was built over kerosene
But we can watch it burn-

[Pre-Chorus: Leah Kelly]
And all I ever wanted
Was sunlight and honesty
Highlights to wanna repeat
Let's get away from here and
Live like the movies do
I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think

[Chorus: EDEN & Leah Kelly]
So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause you can wish away forever
But you'll never find a thing like today

[Snippet]
Eyes fixed on the ground
Am I holdin' you up?
No talkin' through
Nowhere for the sing-

[Verse 1: ATO]
Yo
Two-piece running off the neck, yeah
Those some wild nights running up in West, yeah
Fuck the talk I'm just tryna see the net, yeah
In the dark boy, there's a lot of noise here
Yeah, the rose Gold come in so clean, what's the time?
On my third eye 'cause they wanna scheme on a guy
Lifetime, and I dot my I's cross my T's
Lay low, touch Notting Hill with my G's

[Chorus: ATO]
Falling tonight
Shit ain't perfect but I'm fine
You can kill the bright lights for the night
Wonder if it's all just in my head
And the sunsets, quite red
I can already feel tomorrow on my neck
She don't know why I'm tripping and neither do I
Drinking 'till we sinking and I hand you my mind

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
2AM and I just got to East on Shoreditch High Street
We outside the Ace like I'm on broadway with my posse
Black Tesla, so I don't need a driver
We fucking on the M1, that's what I call a rider
If shawty look like Winnie, I save her like Macgyver
The double F is Fendi
The double G is me
And she know my dick notori-ous, shit is B.I.G, ay
I can make you famous, I call TMZ
She in PrettyLittleThing, looking like a P.Y.T
Kris Kites Jesus chain, looking like the G.O.D
God damn, what's that? Sending photos on WhatsApp
Shawty caught me slipping, got me falling for a thirst trap


[Chorus: ATO]
Falling tonight
Shit ain't perfect but I'm fine
You can kill the bright lights for the night
Wonder if it's all just in my head
And the sunsets, quite red
I can already feel tomorrow on my neck
She don't know why I'm tripping and neither do I
Drinking 'til we sinking and I hand you my mind

[Verse 3: ATO]
Mirror flip the light
Feel the moment swinging
Dripping
Flying or I'm falling
Depend on where you're sitting
I ain't saying much
When the beat cut
Keep my eyes closed
We're going all or nothing
Underpass
Drown, switching lanes, pushing ninety-five
The sky bleeding by design, on my Dev Hynes
Make a left, pull the light, hit the side street
Couldn' stop for the night, moving light speed
I don't take advice, when the stakes high
If I get it then it's mine and I split it twice
What you running from
Is where you're running to
Boy, if you cross the line, know I'ma have to pull you back
Yeah, that's how I was raised, it's a fact
Left foot in the white
Right foot in the black

[Outro: ATO]
This life is lonely if you give it your all
They can't feel this moment like you want them to
The unknown makes you feel small
What you're running from is what you're running to
And she chasing the sunset
Left me in the darkness
How could I forget?
Girl, you're still my friend


[Intro]
Come on, what's the big deal? Nobody's that heartless!

[Verse 1]
So listen here, I'm the voice in your head
And I can say the words that make you feel scared
So here's to you, and all the problems that we've made
And I know it's so hard to stay afloat
When you make monsters out of thoughts
And you're dragged under
And everyone in around you is too far away to notice
Your chest start to crush, oh, but it's alright
Oh, you'll be alright
So just breathe, it's almost over
And don't let the monster in your head
Become your fears
'Cause you can save yourself, you know
You know

[Verse 2]
So listen here, I know it's hard
Maybe I can't be what you want
But I'm just who I am, and I'm trying to be what you could need
And I am still here, that voice in your head
And I'll be there for you, when no one else cares
And this is it, as far as where we've got since then
So know a good thing when you got it
And I hope you know you don't go alone

[Outro]
Come on, what's the big deal? Nobody's that heartless!
You know it's time
It's time to decay


[Chorus]
On days when you feel like
It's me, won't you say hi
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
On days when you feel like
It's me, won't you say hi
Won't play with you meanwhile
It all fades, can we re start
All I feel
Can you feel it too (Yo)
All I am (Yo Beautiful, how could you feel alone)
(Truth be told, I love you more than anything I've ever known)

[Verse 1]
Through the storm
Bridges burnt and kept us warm in the cold
I grew up travelling this globe, you've been my only home
Boy I jumped, woke up flying
Blinded by the lights
Just know if I'm gone for a while
It's because I'm changing your life
Brush off the frame, still I'm blessed
I give no fucks for the rest
I got a show tonight
I'm flying through the voice in my head
No longer question the skies
Lost in the hustle and bustle
Uniting over the heavens
But we fighting over the struggle
New love rise then it fall
I'm keeping my circle small
Split Amaretto with Mum
And we let that talk
I'm caught up in the present, forgot the strength of my past
Had to stop, watch this shadow of mind pass over my heart
So dark it shines forever
My phone dead, while I'm stringing all these sentences together
Got to thinking 'bout my brother
I'm losing bare sleep over anxiety pains
Watching my friends getting pulled into different frames
I'll get you next time
I put that on my whole life
The train passed as the night burned
I wonder, who was that girl
(And yea sometimes I feel like i'm losing you by sticking around)

[Chorus]
On days when you feel like
It's me, won't you say hi
Won't play with you meanwhile
It all fades, can we re start
All I feel
Can you feel it too
All I am

[Post-Chorus]
Feel the lie
When you're on the slide
Won't you take your time
Won't you make it right
Don't wanna make it ghost
So you won't say that

[Verse 2]
And I'm falling away
One day I'll be strong
Always seem to get small things so fucking wrong
This, will be alright when you frame it
I'll go
Give me a lie for when I'm lying awake
The feelings I have they can't make you stay
This, will be alright when you frame it (On days when you feel like)
I'll go (It's me, won't you say hi)
You stay (Won't play with you meanwhile)
On the right side (It all fades, can we re start)
Of the wrong time (All I feel, can you feel it too)
All I am (Won't play with you meanwhile)
(It all fades, can we re start)
And it's all I owe you
Can you feel it broken, two

[Intro]
I can't find you
But can't fault you, 'cause I
Can get so caught up in my own head
You just float through, I can't catch you
And I can understand but can't face the feeling
That I'm just another end

[Chorus]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Verse]
But I can float too, and I don't ask for much from you
And maybe that's too much, too soon
So I, keep rolling through the blackout
No fires without some fallout
Made peace out of the pieces
Now I can't take it back now, no
But I keep on track now up
And yeah, that's all of it
I gave up my youth for this 'cause I wanted it, and
If you think that I need you then you're out of your head
But I want you

[Bridge]
So bring me down and drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And I'll lay me down, unfinished now
It hurts

[Chorus]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Refrain]
Come back to you, come back to you
Oh, it's always you, gon' come back to you
Come back to you, gon' come back to you, yeah
Come back to you

[Bridge]
So bring me down and drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And I'll lay me down, unfinished
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Chorus]
When you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to, if you let me
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Outro]
"There you go Jonathon that's another problem solved"

[Intro]
I can't find you
But can't fault you, 'cause I
Can get so caught up in my own head
You just float through, I can't catch you
And I can understand but can't face the fear
That I'm just another end

[Chorus]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Verse]
I can float too, and I don't ask for much from you
But maybe that's too much, too soon
So I, keep rolling through the blackout
No fires without some fallout
Made peace out of the pieces
Now I can't take it back now, no
Keep on track now up
Yeah, that's all of it
I gave up my youth for this 'cause I wanted it, and
If you think that I need you then you're out of your head
But I want you, no

[Bridge]
So bring me down, drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And i'll lay me down, finished now
Yeah

[Chorus]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Refrain]
Come back to you, come back to you
Come back to you, yeah, oh
Come back to you

[Chorus]
So bring me down, drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And i'll lay me down, finished
Yeah, oh

[Outro]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to, if you let me
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Radio chatter between ATC]

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna talk
I could leave the feeling
And honestly I'm surprised
You got nothing left to say
Call it over and over and out

[Verse 2]
I don't need a follow
I could live without it
Done with peripherals twisting my vision
I don't have control
Creating problems from boredom like recreationals

[Outro]
Burn out
Burn sky
Try
Burn out
Burn sky
Try
Burn out
Burn sky
Try
Try
Try

[Verse 1]
I don't follows fighting for a lost cause
Feel like even drifting, we're just off course

[Chorus]
Or is it no good?
What are we if dying for?
What are we lying for, oh, if it's no good?
Good, what would you call it?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Mind if I don't end this dying (I don't follows fighting for a lost cause)
If it's worth it, you would know (Feel like even drifting, we're just off course)

[Verse 3]
Oh, it stops, all the faking, it's all fire
No flame can absolve sin
Oh, it's nothing
I'll get sullen, when I get sober
Despite my best, you keep calling


[Outro]
You got something I don't want to miss out on
I don't leave you over your stead
Would you call that love?
Love
Love
Love, love
You call that love?
Love
Love, love
Would you call that love?
Love
Love, love
All that love
Love
Love, love


[Intro]
Life is just going so quickly, I can't catch it
I don't think anyone can

[Verse 1]
I met the devil in the hills last night
I was driving by myself, alone
He said, "Boy, what you running from?"
I said, "I don't know"
I don't know if it was a better time
But girl, we were giants then
Endless nights, we were infinite (So, terrified, I guess)
Summer's end would mean the death of us

[Chorus]
But summer past, and we grew up
And all of our paths, they split up
And I haven't seen your face or heard your voice in so long
So, so long
We had a good run, it's over now
(No, I'm not sad about it, but, I'm just, it's weird)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, lying on the grass, talk is so old
Living under Orion, we grew so bold
Lying on our days, we were outlaws
Our loss, but
Catch me if you can, never wiped out
Tryin' to catch a wave, tryin' to break out
I guess I didn't know
And now I'm gone
But it don't hurt me anymore
That's just the way it goes
Yeah, I should've known
But, I heard you talking through the walls late last night
"There are no ends, just grays and half-lives" (Left me in pieces)
Half-time (And I heard it), it's alright (And I heard it)


[Chorus]
That summer past, and we grew up
And all of our plans, they split us up
And I haven't seen your face or heard your voice in so long
So, so long
We had a good run, it's over now

[Interlude]
So, please, don't fade me out
So, please, don't fade me out
So, please, don't lose me now
I heard the words that you never said
Smokescreen from a cigarette
Exhale, we can never be what's in our heads
(So, please, don't fade me out)
Elevation doesn't matter now, it's straight ahead
Sending shivers down my spine, life pirouettes
It's cool, we're used to losing real friends
Only ever feeling it in retrospect
(So, please, don't lose me now)
And we were really breathing, not silhouettes
Maybe in another dream this would never end

[Outro]
'Cause everything is not alright
And we are falling
But that's just life
Without some lows, there is no highs
And everything will be okay
Though we are all hurting
'Cause time flies fast
And you know, no pain is forever
Ever, forever
(I don't think, I'm not saying you should
Be really cautious and shit, I'm, quite the opposite
Just like it's, everything is so, I mean
Expecting anything to last forever is ridiculous isn't it?
I think that's ridiculous
You think that's ridiculous?
Yeah, of course everything lasts forever)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you spoke of how you believed in God
But didn't believe in religion
You saw heaven in your son's eyes
As you closed yours
I've learnt nothing is mine
Now I've soaked up every shore
Never felt more alive
My expections drowned in the tide
The dark days aren't over
While you're looking for closure
They're still looking for you
But the darkness might pass over
If you're quiet enough
As it does every night

As you're still and watching the world from the outside
I've been walking alone for a while
Thinking about us I've gone far and
Afraid to call out in case I don't hear your response
Ten days adrift
Wrote a night of clarity for me
Feeling invisible as the wind whispered to the sea

I see words in your pictures
You see pictures in my words
Every perfect moment requires a slight uncertainty
Like my faith, no person should be alone
Long enough to feel the mirror change
I thought I left my heart back there with you
But here it is following me
And I'm ashamed to say it
As you watch a small city unfold
So behind it's ability to think forward
Re-opened your mind to see God in perfect timing
Your blessing

[Chorus]
I'll lose you for the life I'm chasing
I didn't come back the same
I know it, you know it too
It's falling so heavy on you lately
Head on my chest but
You never felt more alone (You never felt more alone)
It takes time to wake up on the right side
Oh, it's just a habit I'm breaking, for good
It's just another life phasing - good

[Verse 2]
I've never felt this pressure like my wings are spreading
I feel no way, feel no way, yeah that's the Devil singing
Take you time with me like it means something
And we can talk for hours and let time listen
You're talking about life like you'll live forever
She look into his eyes until he dream about her
Running from something and mask it as wisdom
But I listen cause I see the truth and in truth it feels nice

[Bridge]
It feels nice when you let go
It feels wrong, it feels right
You know some things
You know some things

It feels nice when you let go
It feels wrong, it feels right
You know some things
You know some things

[Chorus]
I'll need you for the life I'm chasing
I didn't come back the same
I know it, you know it too
It's falling so heavy on you lately
Head on your chest but
You never felt more alone
It takes time to wake up on the right side
Oh, it's just a habit I'm breaking, for good
It's just another life phasing - good

[Verse 1: EDEN]
The morning light shines a lifeline
Escape is what I need
I should've listened last night, girl
This is beyond belief
That we keep falling for the lure of
Liquid confidence and lies
And we skydive from walls we built
Dying just to feel alive

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN]
On the way down screamin'

[Chorus: EDEN]
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming

[Verse 2: EDEN]
Oh, I'm on fire
There's a burning in my bones and in my eyes
These dreams, they're taking hold, I just need time
Time

[Verse 3: gnash]
Building walls to burn them down
Cannonballs to watch me drown
You've got me lost in here and now
You've got me gone and lost and found
We only hang in evenings
And I don't know what I'm thinking
But I know that I won't think it
If I keep up with this thinking
All these dreams and all these plans
We shared under the moonlight
They're dreams and plans that I have
I just don't know if you'll fit right
When I leave in the morning
And I kiss you and say goodnight
I kick myself until we kick it
Should've told you goodbye
Coming home so late at night
With clothes covered in sand
I don't know just what I'm missing
But I'm doing what I can
And if all we have is time then we will find

Interlude:
Boy you are in a hurry!
If you were lookin' at what I'm looking at you'd be in a hurry too


[Chorus: EDEN]
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright (Whoa)
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night (Whoa)
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright (Whoa)
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night (Whoa)
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming

Step up to the Funtime Dance Floor
(Dance Floor)
Where we play you music plus more
(Plus more)
Don't be scared of what will happen
(Happen)
We're just having fun and dancin'
(Dancin')
These monstrous animatronics are haunting me
Possessed electronics following me
I can't get my work done in peace
Crawling in air ducts from room to room
Feeling like this place is my tomb
I'm just tryin to survive, else I'll die soon
There's something sick and sadistic about this place
It sets the off at night
No one will believe me, so I gotta fight
To move on
Through their dance of death
They're all around me now
I can't catch my breath
Funtime watching you at night
Come here
Never fear our bite
Don't scream
You'll just make it worse
This dance
Is our undying curse
Dance Floor
Dance Floor
Funtime Dance Floor
Funtime Dance Floor
Funtime Dance Floor
Dance Floor
Dance Floor
When I hit the floor
It's about to be a show
Ain't nowhere to go
Just to let you know
(Just to let you know)
When I hit the floor
It's about to be a show
I know you want some more
Yeah baby let's go
(Yeah baby let's)
Please let me free
(We'll never let you go free)
(We'll never let you leave)
(We'll never let you go free)
(We'll never let you be)
Oh, Please just let me be
(We'll never let you go free)
(We'll never let you leave)
(We'll never let you go free)
(We'll never let you be)
Funtime watching you at night
Come here
Never fear our bite
Don't scream
You'll just make it worse
This dance
Is our undying curse
Funtime watching you at night
Come here
Never fear our bite
Don't scream
You'll just make it worse
This dance
Is our undying curse

[Intro]
Don't know how well this is gonna be
But, the basic idea is-

[Verse 1]
Free fall for now
Desert air won't drown you out
And for a second I thought the world was ending
And I couldn't breathe in
Yeah, and so this isn't your time
Yeah, been chasing kairos with those scapegoat eyes
Can't you realize?
Fuck the summertime, it's you
So scared of overgrowing youth
When it's not done with you

[Chorus]
And everybody gon' run, run
Everybody gon' run, run
And you can call it what you want
But I call it moving on
And I'm so done with singing words I don't believe in no more

[Verse 2]
So what you rushing for?
Who said it's now or never?
I think you're taking on the wrong advice
But it's alright if these are your worst times
You know you're good
You're good


[Interlude]
And if you want you can breathe on your own
This isn't what I thought but it's beautiful
Make peace with your mistakes and they'll turn to gold
Weightless, I let  go

[Chorus]
And everybody gon' run, run
Everybody gon' run, run
And you can call it what you want
But I call it moving on
And I'm so done with singing words I don't believe in no more

[Outro]
No more, call it what you want
Call it what you want but I call it growing up and I'm done



Sunday night, have a good cry
Wipe my eye, as the light died

I can't help but see your eyes from here
But I, a thousand miles away
And years ago

This time I tell 'em white lies
Walk my eyes, say I'm alright

I can't help but see your eyes from here
But I, a thousand miles away
And years ago

She said, "Don't try; figure it out
You won't find me thinking about you
Know that we're both better off this way
And I guess I won't make a sound
You won't find me crying about you
Know that there's just nothing else to say."

(Don't try; figure it out
You won't find me thinking about you
Know that we're both better off this way
And I guess I won't make a sound
You won't find me crying about you
Know that there's just nothing else to say.)

I can't help but see your eyes from here
But I, a thousand miles away
And years ago


[Intro]
I never had the guts to run away
Ever since sixteen, been dreaming of a brighter day
Out of control and out of everything
You came out the blue, or was it blue-gray?

[Verse]
Felt like waking up in a new place (New place, new place)
That stole the dark from the night
Shone a new way, ooh (New way, new way)
But I can feel your heartbeat rising
Even when you're ghost
And I can feel your every single movement

[Chorus]
So, good morning (Good morning)
Good morning (Good morning)
Good morning
It's a good morning (Good morning, yeah)
Good morning (Good morning)
Good morn-

[Verse]
I felt like waking up in a new place, ooh (As day breaks mortality)
That stole the dark from the night (Colors run and bleed)
Shone a new way, yeah (New way, new way)
(For fear now's the only time there is)
But I can feel your heartbeat rising (And just as good night comes following)
Even when you're ghost (Follow down and seem)
And I can feel your every single move (I, who watched this disappear)


[Chorus]
So, good morning (And out of the dark you'll find you)
Good morning
Good morning (Given the time and space)
It's a good morning
Good morning (The world will bend to guide you)
Good morning

[Outro]
I never had the guts to run away
(And just as good night comes following)
(And out of the dark you'll find you)
Ever since sixteen, been dreaming of a brighter day
(Follow down and seem)
(Given the time and space)
Out of control and after everything
(I, who watched this disappear)
(The world will bend to guide you)
You came out the blue

[Intro]
I never had the guts to run away
Ever since sixteen
Been dreaming of a brighter day
Out of control and out of everything
You came out the blue
Or was it blue gray

[Verse]
Felt like waking up
In a new place (New place, new place)
Stole the dark from the night
Shone a new way, ooh (New way, new way)
And i can feel your heartbeat rising
Even when you're a ghost
I can feel your every single move

[Chorus]
So good morning
Good morning
Good morning
So good good morning
Good morning
Good mor-

[Verse]
Felt like waking up
In a new place (New place, new place)
Stole the dark from the night
Shone a new way (New way, new way)
I can feel your heartbeat rising
Even when you're a ghost
I can feel your every single move


[Chorus]
So good morning
Good morning
(And out of the dark you'll find you)
Good morning
(Given the time and space)
It's a good morning
Good morning
(The world will bend to guide you)
Good morning

[Outro]
I never had the guts to run away
(And just as good night comes following)
Ever since sixteen
Been dreaming of a brighter day
(Follow down and seem)
Out of control and out of everything
(I, who watched this disappear)
You came out the blue



[Verse 1]
I wanted you to be the last thing on my mind
I wanted you to be the reason I close my eyes
But I can't sleep
And oh God, I wanted to be your high
But everything I said, it went unheard
And everything you saw with eyes straight blurred
Became our downfall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you say I drink and I smoke and I talk too much
But I know you lied when you said that you just gotta go and save yourself
So hear me out
You know everybody talks, girl
And it means nothing 'till you let it
But if you keep second guessing then there's only gonna be one end

[Chorus]
But you can leave if you really want to
And you can run if you feel you have to
Now I'll be fine if you ever ask me
I know it's hard, but no one said it's easy
Falling's easy
But there's only one way up

[Verse 2]
So I been thinking that I think too much
And I can't sleep, but I can dream of us
And I've been seeing shit like horror cuts
It's burning down, I gotta drown this out
And you said you need me to let this go
But it's who I am, or am I just losing it
'Cause you said jump and I went first but falling's always been my downfall

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say I drink and I smoke and I talk too much
But I know you lied when you said that you just had enough and save yourself
So hear me out
You know everybody talks, girl
And it means nothing 'till you let it
And if you keep second guessing then there's only gonna be one end

[Chorus]
But you can leave if you really want to
And you can run if you feel you have to
And I can drink if I feel I have to
I know it's hard, but I can't feel like I used to
Like I used to
'Cause I used to defy gravity
Defy gravity
Goodbyes keep dragging me
Down
And I'm fighting gravity
Defying gravity
I tried but I keep falling
'Cause falling's easy
But it only brings you down

I only ask to get ahead of me
So I can see the man in the cemetery
And I was in love with the prophecy
Just another slave to hypocrisy
People distracted by the world outside
And fail to see the world when they close their eyes
I'm feeling the imbalance, hatred and malice between us
Why we at war? We should be more like Venus

I was born by the river, raised by the queen
Faced with reality, mind willing to dream
Contemplating a life of freedom
I was forced to turn my back on the door that saw everyone leaving
Rock bottom is a strong foundation
Built an empire on it with some words in the basement
We write the truth and then they write us off
Just a couple lines that Malcolm was willing to cross
I came back home with a rose and some torn up clothes
Played it next to a desperate note but it remained composed
I said Lord for I see but I cannot sail
How does one win when he's ready to fail?
I know you know my heart, my spirit, my soul
I been overwhelmed by fear since I was nine years old

She came in my life so unexpected
She felt love before I had it resurrected
If you are, you are who you say you are
You are out of this world, you are Jupiter
Now that would explain this new atmosphere
We didn't plan it to be hard and to be so far

But we've gone, baby we've gone
So you take it off when I turn it on
Walk in my mind into the unknown
I walk in your's and we can get lost

Tell me when you're down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down

And I was born by the river, raised by the queen
Faced with reality, mind willing to dream
Contemplating a life of freedom
I was forced to turn my back on the door that saw everyone leaving
Rock bottom is a strong foundation
Built an empire on it with some words in the basement
We write the truth and then they write us off
Just a couple lines that Malcolm was willing to cross

You said you had a tunnel for a past
And described when you saw the end glisten like a star
While from so far I'm an alien
We see different worlds in our craniums
See these are vivid words, vivid dreams, lonely nights
You're gonna spend all your time making money
'Til you spend all your money making up for lost time

Life ain't easy, sunrise by the stream, tell life to meet me
Stuck in a place only I can free me, deep in the east in the belly of the beast
I know you know that this ain't easy but I get my bottles for free
Deep in the valley where my shadow don't sleep, we get to stalling while brothers are balling

'Cause we are more life for the ready
More hard, Henny gets buried with the Penny
I die, you die, they die heavy
You live, I live, not so many
Welcome to the matrix
Parallel world where we're living
It took space to see the world that we live in
And it took time, it took pain, it took vision
And I've never been here before
She came down like a meteor
Yes, I'm young and I'm insecure
I've seen too many leave like a sycamore
And she cool - like ice sometimes
But she can save you - from your hardest times
Like old Gods and I don't really fuck with the others
My back gets up with the others
And I'm analyzing the time and I'm seeing this widen
My pen gets to pain like an ambulance siren
I pray to not pray, then I pray it again
I been deep where faith is the only way
I depict my own flaws and slam my own doors
The shit I've seen would leave you lock-jawed
I'm a young fighter, deep thinker, raw writer
Walk through the dark 'til the sun finds your shadow

The more they hate me the more they help me
The more they love me the more they hurt me
The dynamic of a lonely journey
I failed to say a word but I know that you heard me
Your absence is present, I feel it
Praying on the day I count my blessings and mean it
Close my eyes and see the devil trynna be Jesus
In a world where believers are trynna be leaders

But he's completely lost

I'm just my darkest fear and my greatest achievement
Thousands of snakes and I'm back with EDEN
Faith is staying strong without notorious reason
They say God is love and that love is freedom
But love took my heart and it left me bleeding
Love had my on my knees begging and pleading
Love showed me the valley of the shadow of death
Love showed me life is a beautiful test
A man told me people live Hell on Earth
That's why I had to put down a hell of a verse
They say life's a bitch but she's beautiful
Motherfuckers out here are tryna snatch her purse
And she said who you gonna be?
Every breath's cost but that karma comes free
She can see I'm not afraid to show her my fears
And when I'm gone I hope she remembers the words I whispered in her ear
Said she said who you gonna be?
Every breath's cost but that karma comes free
She can see I'm not afraid to show her my fears
And when I'm gone I hope she remembers the words I whispered in her ear
I said, yeah, I got a tunnel for a past
And described when I saw the end glisten like a star
Where I'm from's so far, I'm an alien
We see different worlds in our craniums

And now a great thing in the street
Seems any human nod
Where a move in strange democracy
The million masks of God
The million masks of the joker
Because the joker is the player
The trick player
Who plays ultimately the great trick on himself
So really, there can be no resentment about this, nobody to blame, nobody to turn around in the end and say:
"You, you bastard! You did this to me!"
Because it's always you, who are ultimately responsible

When life draws for the side table
I feel to pause, watch it flash before your maple eyes
Being fed lies through the cage we've been held inside
Heaven is the answer to the question that we're living in

And there's an opposite to everything
Yang and yin compelled by the sedative we're letting in
Time counting down 'til there's no tomorrows left for me
One-way trip to heaven had me sitting in the window seat

Long talks with the man in the mirror
But he don't move when I move, we used to be together
I see clouds when I close my eyes
But it ain't rained in years, it might rain tonight

I might see everything clear, tear after tear
I'm gonna climb my fears, you can't tell me 'bout peers
Can't trust 'em 'til the end 'cause the end ain't your friend
When you run out of love 'cause all that love got spent

I've been spending these days on my own
Being thrown like a stone into the sea, the unknown
Escaped a long line of clones in the queue for purpose
People that don't know themselves make me nervous

They call this home, I call it the unknown
Trapped between letting go and the need for control
Still looking for the spaceship that we crashed and burned
For we were looking for Heaven when we fell on Earth

You said that I said that I'm yours
I told you that I made myself at home in your flaws
They be learning from the greats while I learn from their mistakes that found the Devil's gates
Amen

[Chorus]
We've been here since Sunday died
Eyes closed, I never pray for the heights
Tough past but nothing we never made it through
Tell that young me, yeah, I'm still with you
So keep running, don't stop yo, keep running
I've been nothing, being something filled somebody's soul
And I keep running, stay fronting, the pain is numbing
The war here is pure, I swear I can hear you calling

[Verse]
And she's new to the city
Running from a couple milli
Got a voice like Whitney Houston
And she don't wanna tell me where she came from
Yeah, she said she wants to leave it all behind
I told her I got nothing, she said that's a lie
She's afraid to show me her feelings
If I'm honest, if I'm honest
We go through the same
(Sample)
And I been here before
I can't make the same mistakes with you
You're so afraid to, so afraid to
So selfishly
You see these words don't fit between these lines
My I's are too big
Brother slipping for retail
Grabbing apples for females
All that shit plays out when the bank's too big
Yeah, it's all games until the boy can't quit
Back by the stream on my own
Stone after stone
But none of them gon' make it
Clone after clone
See, I always kept it real
More money, more snakes
She took on the world
But this mirror she couldn't face
Time's passing me by
What it costs to feel alive
More money till you blind
You got four, I want five
And I'm better than I was
I bet she'd call that showing off
They ain't with us, they against us
Sometimes I need to feel lost
I told you I don't want the fame
Lyrics for a face
Tell me what really fucking changed
Apart from how you say my name
Been on the right side of your life
Every fucking time
But in your eyes I saw a mountain
And I wasn't ready to climb
[Bridge]
This song don't have an end
How much time you spend on that money though
You're so afraid to let it go
But you ain't lived in a year or two
And maybe we should talk about it
ATO, are you're still there?
I ain't never left you
You're always on my mind, I can't forget you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
We've been here since Sunday died
Eyes closed I never prayed for the heights
Tough past but nothing we never made it through
Tell that young me, yeah, I'm still with you
So keep running, don't stop yo, keep running
I've been nothing
Being something filled somebody's soul
And I keep running, stay fronting, the pain is numbing
The water here is pure
I swear I can hear you calling

[Outro]
I heard you like to pray
Heard you like to pray
Heard you learned to pray for me
We've been here since Sunday died
Feel alive

[Verse]
I never had the guts to run away
Ever since sixteen, been dreaming of a brighter day
Out of control and out of everything
You came out the blue, or was it blue-gray?
Felt like waking up in a new place (New place, new place)
We stole the dark from the night
Shone a new way, ooh (New way, new way)
But I can feel your heartbeat rising
Even when you're a ghost
And I can feel your every single movement

[Outro]
How fast the light died out
We lost track of ourselves, riding the wave (Woah)
At last, the time will run out
Waited for us, don't you lose it now (You gave up, yeah)
Don't you lose me now

[Verse 1]
I can't see a way through
And I can't be myself around you (If I'm honest)
I can't stop myself from thinkin' it's all over (Yeah)
You're gonna stop crying
And after the end comes whatever (Forever I still think of you)
And ever you need me (And ever you've lost touch of you)
These songs all loop

[Interlude]
Touchdown, giant leap
Heartbreak, godspeed
Highlight, headland
Edge of the world, fading out

[Verse 2]
And I loved how the sky burned
Soaking now, we slip apart (Soaking now, I'm fallin' apart)
Older now, I can't tell you and me apart (Apart)
I just wanted to let you know (You)
That I burnt when the sky heard (Sky heard how you stopped)
Disintegrate and fall apart (Plain sight)
Running out of time (Unfolding inside)
Can never beat the lesser (The courage drought)
Of idle stress, and all the rest of it
Enough to move you
I'm just scared that you'll cu-

[Chorus]
Still, I loved every second of it
And I can't have the past and where I'm going
Said just take the best of all the pieces (How one loose end, and one step)
And the reasons you're gone (Luck is down, that you left)
Still, I see myself in all the people I let go (Deja vu, pass through)
I'm just scared that you'll l-

[Bridge]
Yeah, older now, I keep pouring over those lives white lies
Holding out, how many seconds 'til the roof falls in?

[Verse 3]
So ice the hurt
Last time enough, forever breaks us up
Connotations burnt into my lexicon (Yeah)
Foreign feelings riot until the past is won
All my friends forgot but I'm still holding on
I keep fucking up
My lines get crossed and you wanna die often
How you gonna hide all those tears from me?
All you wanted just slipped through changing times
It's not the same
Oh, I'm just scared that you'll c-

[Chorus]
Still, I loved every second of it
And I can't have the past and where I'm going
Said just take the best of all the pieces (How one loose end, and one step)
And the reasons you're gone (Luck is down, that you left)
Still, I see myself in all the people I let go (Deja vu, pass through)
I'm just scared that you'll l-

[Verse 1]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so and this I know for sure
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
And thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how

[Chorus]
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya

[Verse 2]
You think you got it, oh, you think you got it
But "got it" just don't get it when there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when's there's feelings involved
If what they say is "nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes love the exception?
And why-o, why-o, why-o, why-o, why-o, why-o
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here? Yeah

[Chorus]
But hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya

[Outro]
I'm too cool, I'm too cool for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cold, I'm too cool for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cool
I'm too cold

[Intro]
I don't think I knew
That I felt like I knew what I was doing
But I don't really remember feeling very scared about it

[Verse]
The water was cool, and you're shining
The windows were burning patterns in my mind
Running away was so tiring
Holding your stare, I felt miles behind

[Pre-Chorus]
And how do you love when you're frightened?
The thought of me fucking up all these threads
Situations I know are just passing
I'm holding on for you
And static feel

[Chorus]
The light ran down the wall
Holding back the stars
Dividing us in new ways
Away from sleep
Confusion has its cost
Wave pools in the dark
Crashing 'round my head

[Bridge]
I don't think there was like, a happiest time
I feel like there are happy moments

[Verse]
The water was cool, and you're shining
The windows were burning patterns in my mind
Running away was so tiring
Holding your stare, I slip miles behind

[Pre-Chorus]
And how do you love when you're frightened?
The thought of me fucking up all these threads
Situations I know are just passing
I'm holding on for you
And how to sleep

[Chorus]
The light ran down the wall
Holding back the stars
Dividing us in new ways
Away from sleep
Confusion has its cost
Wave pools in the dark
Crashing 'round my head

[Verse 1]
So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop the sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow, how
When all you know is up, it's hard not to feel like you ain't going down, down

[Verse 2]
Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversating with a smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now
Somehow, anyhow
So now

[Pre-Chorus]
Icarus
No, I can't escape this fall
Falling in reverse
Falling in reverse

[Chorus]
So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got?
I've nothing left to give you
And I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause it all just feels the same
And I got all I want
I had you where I wanted
I guess I don't know
How to live with a good thing
And not break it into nothing
Self destruct just to feel, or so it goes

[Verse 3]
One (Thank you so much, guys)
So tell me how you want me here now
Keep crying down the phone
Yeah, that's all I seem to hear now
Keep lying through your teeth
Lie to me, lie with me now
(I'm halfway there, but it's like, shit, I haven't really been doing anything for the last year. And it's insane that I've been doing a shit ton but like, in terms of... I don't know.)

[Verse 4]
So tell me how you really feel now
Ain't been asked that in a while
Yet you still hope that they'll hear you out
Just keep at it, bro, these things always seem to fix themselves somehow
Suck it up, some would kill just to stand
Where you're standing now

Icarus
No I can't escape this fall

[Chorus]
So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got?
I've nothing left to give you
'Cause I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause fuck it, it all feels the same
And I got all I want
I thought that I'd feel something
Guess I'll never know
How to live with a good thing
Fucked my life up for nothing, nothing
'Cause you don't care if I'm still bleeding
You just scream until you hear my name

[Outro]
So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop that sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow
Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversating with the smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now
Somehow, anyhow
By now

[Verse]
I feel no certain way performing
With foreign strings and final season growth
Oh, I can't find you
And I don't know if I want to
I can't find you
And I don't know
And worst won't follow the meaning
As lies don't find
It's seeming that words don't fall
As easy as I wanted them to
And if the center of all is nothing
Then I'm sure we'll meet again
'Cause as the sun, it sets in circles
In elliptical faces in darkness, I know
I don't

[Verse 1]
I tied it to speechless
And I tried to piece it
Together
We didn't talk for a while
I know the flying made you cry
But thinking about it now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd burn some bridges, sure
Cut some people out and leave them behind, sure
And if we ever were the same
I'd be the rain

[Chorus]
And you'd be tomorrow
And I'd be the rain
Oh, you'd be tomorrow
And I'd be the rain

[Verse 2]
I tied it to speechless
And I tried to piece it
Together
And falling apart at the seams
But it meant everything
To me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd burn some bridges, sure
Cut some people out and leave them behind, sure
And if we ever were the same
I'd be the rain

[Chorus]
And you'd be tomorrow
And I'd be the rain
Oh, you'd be tomorrow
And I'd be the rain

You know, our progress is just really slow
Because we're trying to just find ways through
And we're just veering
Backwards at times just to get through some of this stuff
And it's just crazy, all the things that we have to do

[Verse 1]
I'll say it once for the Bayside
I come alive when the light dies
Overcast but we're inside
Eyes wide, lied twice
My advice don't mean shit tonight
'Cause I've been driving though I can't see shit and I've
Been lying through my teeth just to get the feeling right
And feel alright
So girl just turn the lights down
Yeah
And too many times I've been caught up when I know better
So I push it back down 'cause I never want to let it out
But I've been dying since I saw you were gone
Forget me 'cause I ain't waiting for no-one
'Cause I ain't waiting for no-one

[Verse 2]
And I've been trying to dig my way out of the ocean
And punch a hole in the sky
And flood the light through to midnight
And I don't know where you're going
You can't expect the past to repeat with the ending changed
So don't forget where you came from
And we are never alone
Drops making waves in the ocean

[Outro]
(Phone rings...)
Hello?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Ok...

[Verse 1]
Ten tonne, ballast on my chest
As I woke up, a heavy inhale
For the nights you stole, oh
Fucked up, the balance in my head
But it's all good
I'll see you again another (Dream)
Oh

[Chorus 1]
But I miss the way the sun streamed through my window
And I miss the way you almost held the tide
But still, it's nice, dreaming that you're somewhere
Feeling the same heat that I did
Another time (I know, I know)
If invisible lines lead your way back to me
Walk the line

[Verse 2]
I said I'd walk you home but we still went our own way
The tears lost in rain on your cheekbones in silence
And I pulled my head out the darkness in your house
Can't stay 'til the morning, refracted my way out
From nightmares in my car, as I lay beside you
And fucked up my timeline and twisted your end with
So much still to go, as the sun sets behind you
I can't let it go, you can't hold me
I can't always, oh

[Bridge]
Talk it out
Cut me off
Chalk it down
To my head
Ba-balancing my head
Slow it down
Rise and fall
Chalk it down
To my head down

[Chorus 2]
And I miss the way (Talk it out)
The sun streamed through my window (Cut me off)
And I miss the way (Chalk it down)
You almost held the tide (To my head)
But still, it's nice (Balancing my head)
Dreaming that you're somewhere (Slow it down)
Feeling the same heat that I did (Rise and fall)
No fear no fall (Chalk it down) (I know, I know)
If invisible lines lead your way back to me (To my head)
Still, I got nothing, woah

[Verse 1]
And honestly, I can't sleep no more
On film it's dark but it's only reconstructing light that don't shine no more, I
Can't help but dream of nights, I can't live no more
Feelings die and she don't sleep in my arms no more, yeah

[Chorus]
But I'll get right in a little bit, I'll find
My light in the little bits
Passed out on my bedroom floor, I'll get back up
I lost my mind when I needed it, yeah
It's so sad, what we had was never enough for us
Just echoes and dust

[Refrain]
Just saying, if you want it, go find it
I'm just saying, if you want it, go find it
Just saying, if you want it, go find it
Just saying

[Verse 2]
Yeah, self-division in the dark
You were a multi-colored vision (Yeah)
Versions of another version fell apart (High speed)
Halide lifting silver linings from the dark
And it's just starting to sink in
I ran through the morning
When the light showed me nothing I didn't know before
So close but, you say we're better off
Leave the curtains drawn
I don't think you understand
How we're splitting the loop
A last impression of you, I left some time ago
So how you gon' catch me now? (Fuck it all up)
Woah, these waves just keep ringing out

[Bridge]
So slowly, I watched it burn
So slowly, yeah
All the things that we love tie us up
Just echoing slowly

[Chorus]
I'll get right in a little bit (So slowly, I watched it burn)
I'll find my light in the little bits
Passed out on my bedroom floor
I'll get back, get back up
I lost my mind when I needed it, yeah (So slowly, yeah)
It's so sad, but what we had was never enough for us (All the things that we love)
Just echoes and dust

[Refrain]
Just saying, if you want it, go find it
I'm just saying, if you want it, go find it
Just saying, if you want it, go find it
Just saying

[Outro]
How fast the light died out
We lost track of ourselves, riding the wave (Woah)
At last, the time of our lives
Waited for us, don't you lose it now (You gave up, yeah)
Don't you lose me now

[Intro]
Hey, how are you doing?
I just wanted to say that I miss you, I guess
And I'm sorry
Call me back
Bye

[Verse 1: EDEN]
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel now
60 over the limit just 'cause I can
They say, "You know, you gotta slow down
There's no coming back"
So young and restless, I'm a cliche, yeah
But it's easier said than done

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN]
And I can't keep waiting here
I'm just aging
So I'm gone
Such a shame, and

[Chorus: EDEN]
Baby, I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in saying "I'm never coming home"
But I'm drawing the line
And say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known

[Verse 2: EDEN]
So falling in and falling out fast
I'm burning up, I can't believe this got old so fast
And I'm done with feeling like I'm told I should
'Cause it's a feeling I'm chasing
And I ain't found it here in a while

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN]
But I can't keep waiting here
I'm just aging
So I'm gone
Such a shame, and

[Chorus: EDEN]
Baby, I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in saying "I'm never coming home"
But I'm drawing the line
And say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known

[Outro: EDEN]
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving

[Verse 1: ATO]
Oh I know
Someone else has been here before
And I'm sure you gave them everything
And kisses turned to fucking and that fucking turned to loving
One rumour and two questions had that love turn into nothing

It's so usual, you're so predictable
When you rush when you first meet you end up falling on your knees
And begging, please
Forgive me
I love you, tell me you love me

And she said please, just listen to me
It's not me it's you
You've become somebody new

[Chorus: ATO & EDEN]
And we die
But you and I we are still alive
Don't tell me it'll be alright
Got me feeling like I'm being so cold

And we both know that this is how we die
And together you know we just can't survive
Don't tell me it'll be alright
We both know that this is our demise
The end of a lifetime

[Verse 2: ATO]
You see life ain't the same without me, is it?
You heard I'm in the city, you want me to pay a visit
The problem is, I don't owe you nothing, do I?
I'd be lying to you if I said that I don't miss it

But this is for the best that the storm before the calm arrives
Fighting till the struggle till I hit the fucking override
Huh, no
I'm just done looking for home, you know

Something wrong with wanting more? Who knows
I guess I'll have to find out
She wants all or nothing
If we're not fighting then we're --

Met her at a show, took a couple shots
Hotel, fifteen floors to the top
I don't know her name, knew I shoulda told you
I ain't playing games with you, this one made you wait on me --

I'm just falling
And I can't feel my feet so
I wake up in a new life or
Keep going down, down, down
Just tell me what I'm fighting for
And she said listen to me
There's somebody new, but before I lose you

[Bridge: ATO & EDEN]
In our lifetime you will find out everything you're looking for
And the silence when our words are lost
It says everything we can't ignore

In our lifetime you will find out everything you're looking for
And the silence when our words are lost
It says everything we can't ignore

[Chorus: ATO & EDEN]
And we die
But you and I we are still alive
Don't tell me it'll be alright
Got me feeling like I'm being so cold

And we both know that this is how we die
And together you know we just can't survive
Don't tell me it'll be alright
We both know that this is our demise
The end of a lifetime

[Intro: Puppet]
Alright, alright
Alright, alright (I'll understand)
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 1: Puppet]
Distractions
Fade away
The tides change
The waves remain
My life is out that door
Warring what's worth fighting for
Stay quiet one more day, waste away
I don't think so
Just try and hold me back
Warm-up swings
I'm next at bat
Wound up on wasted days
Swing away
Come on, lets go

[Pre-Chorus: Puppet]
Our time's up
Come out and play
Shoulder to shoulder through the pain

[Chorus: Puppet]
Left out again, that's all I am (All I am, falling)
I'll fight alone and breathe again (Alright, alright)
Take all my friends and leave with them (Alright, alright, alright, alright)
I'll understand (Alright, alright)

Alright, alright
(I'll understand)
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 2: Puppet]
Blue skies
You bring the rain
You're a whisper
They sing my name (Let's go)
I'm offended
Your pity party's ended
You can keep pretending
But I know you know who I am
I don't blend in
Just how I intended
All my patience
I spent it

[Verse 3: EDEN]
I'm calling out when you never listened
How continents felt closer than a mile
And all I can say is it's nothing I can't change

[Bridge: Puppet, EDEN & Both]
Now you tell me what to do
So call me now when you're feeling like it
But I won't turn for you
I've been running out of love, running out of time
Another life, another day
All I can say is it's there's nothing I can't change

[Chorus: Puppet]
Left out again, that's all I am (All I am, falling)
I'll fight alone and breathe again (Alright, alright)
Take all my friends and leave with them (Alright, alright, alright, alright)
I'll understand (Alright, alright)

[Outro: Puppet]
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

[Verse]
I think I lost myself out
Somewhere in between
Finding out who I am
Confusing that with what I dream
And it feels like everyone's done waiting
So what am I supposed to do?
And I can feel these bridges breaking
And I'm drifting further from you, from you
But oh, let it go
'Cause I found God
And he said, "Plans change a lot"
And, so if I can help my luck
Then things won't go the way they're going
And I won't lose hope, and I won't lose courage
And won't fade to gold
Or worse, a shadow
'Cause if everyone is gone, I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be left alone

[Intro]
(The sun can not see our home
'Til death or peace, I see you)

[Verse 1]
How do I say
All I want just falls away?
I don't know how to keep us in time, time
Mind is changing
All you want so far is love, death and some kind of higher high
You're reaching (Reaching)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we're all just drifting by
(You've got to pull yourself out)
Phones in the air
Face to the sky
(You're gonna burn yourself out)
And all this time to realize there's nothing stopping you
(How are you gonna stop it?
You can't stop yourself from being you)
From leaving
(Wanted to, wanted)

[Chorus]
And please don't go, drifter
(Staying when you're passing on, passing over me)
And please don't go, drifter
(In taking, take it, you're taken with all this)

[Verse 2]
What do I say?
All that time just thrown away
I don't know how to keep lives apart
They're bleeding (Yeah)
Mind is racing
All you want so far is love, death and some kind of higher high
You're reaching (Reaching)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we're all just drifting by
Phones in the air
Face to the sky
All this time to realize there's nothing stopping you
From leaving me
(The sun can not see our home
'Til death or peace, I see you
How you want me)

[Chorus]
And please don't go, drifter
(We all see, we are just orbiting you)
And please don't go, drifter
(Stardust in your constellation)
(Planets in your solar system)
And please don't go, drifter
(Spiral, sink in, slighting with her, violent system)
And please don't go, drifter
(I'll listen, find us waning, Ire at the odds)
(You can't hear me at all)
And please don't go, drifter
(Time is wasting, breath is wasted on you)
And please don't go, drifter
(And please don't go)

[Intro]
And I know I've been closing myself off, unsure
I know I've been real hard to reach, harder to love
And I know it's tiring, this shit is getting old

[Pre-Chorus]
But please, just hold on to me
I've slayed these demons, they're old to me
Recurring dreams, this is happening
Tearing my seams; lucid reality

[Chorus]
And I just want you to feel love (love!)
Before it disappears (not!)
'Cause we are more than we're not (wrong!)
So never fear to feel (brave!)
Good when everything's wrong (love!)
And find some beauty there (not!)
'Cause all we ever are is brave (brave!)
And your world's not ending, ooh

[Verse]
So I won't go
I'm still living in the middle of a one-way war
I can't fight it but I'm trying to be what you want, yeah
You can't sing but you're singing this anyway
And anyway, so please just hold on to me
This is no end, we're not finished here
Finding our way, we're just changing
Becoming more than I think of me, yeah
These fears in my head, dreams in my bed
They won't get the best of me, yeah
'Cause I chase dreams 'till the end
These nightmares all bend
Silver linings are all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
So, please, just hold on to me
I've slayed these demons, they're old to me
Recurring dreams, this is happening
Tearing my seams from reality

[Chorus]
And I just want you to feel love
Before it disappears
'Cause we are more than we're not
So never fear to feel
Good when everything's wrong (love!)
And find some beauty there (not!)
'Cause all we ever are is brave

[Verse 1]
I used to be a hurricane
Tell you how that really feel
Show you all that I destroyed
I grew up around the fucking way
I know you ain't really real
I can feel that when you smile
I don't care where you're from
But what you see when you close your eyes
Strangers used to be your friends
They might still be if you didn't care
Oh, I've been here before
Had to check myself to make sure

The feeling still pain
My people in a hurry
My people tryna grab at the change
Stopped looking both ways
When I saw one side is a mirror
And the world is a stage
Fuck you and your games
Are you not entertained
This was never what I pictured
I'm alone in the fray
Putting people first who couldn't say my last name
Letting people hurt, tryna test my faith like ay
Run gone
Tell my brothers, run on
That fight was for me
I'ma keep moving in my sleep till I wake from this dream
And reflect what I see

Is she worse for lying
Or me for believing
Lost Genesis, Lord I lost my freedom
Grew up in conflict
Looking for appeasement
Used to draw the light and sell it to the evening
These days we choose to judge by the preview
Sometimes getting too close
They don't see you
Shame on him for forgetting what we've been through
Shame on me for thinking I need you
Find me in the shadows of the city
Sunset falls behind the skyline
Carry the words you said to me
In case I'm in need of a lifeline

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk to the end of that thought and press the glass
Beyond this life and over Mars
Behind the canvas that holds the stars
The pale blue dot that'll hold your heart
Behind the pretty faces, behind the egos
Behind the paper and the makeshift
Finally find yourself and can't face it
So frustrating, lost conversations
Afraid to be wrong, that's why I never grew
That's why this for me even if I say you
That's why this for me even if I say her
That's why this for me even if I say him
I don't know why, sometimes I look for your face in the sky
More time I push them away
I write cos I never used to know how to say it

[Chorus]
It's just how I feel right now
I don't really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear
It's just how I feel right now
I don't really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear

[Verse 2]
Mean it
Told you that I love you, didn't mean it
Everybody here wants the feeling
Let it fill the room to the ceiling
No one really being, keeping up an appearance
Let down my dearest
Shame is what I needed
Took her to the Eiffel, tryna change her view
You gave her the city but she looking at you
I'm still tryna know myself
Know my path
Cos when you lead the way
That journey's dark
I had to shed some light on my past
I had to change the clocks before
My first alarm, I told them

The last supper
Take time, it's been a cold summer
Ooh, they wanna talk about karma
How could I wish pain on another
This film's a thriller
Sinners act as the pillars
Looking for my view
Brother you ain't supposed to miss the end
All the things that I wrote I writ in pen
You can visit them again and again
So busy talking about me
You abandoned yourself
It's just funny that you'd ask me for help
It's just another story left on the shelf
We so, insecure
Look for more
Life's too short
To step into your 44's
I mean we're young
No idea what we've got in store
Both afraid to write first
Till we fade to thoughts

[Pre-Chorus]
To the end of that thought and press the glass
Beyond this life and over Mars
Behind the canvas that holds the stars
The pale blue dot that'll hold your heart
Behind the pretty faces, behind the egos
Behind the paper and the makeshift
Finally find yourself and can't face it
So frustrating, lost conversations
Afraid to be wrong, that's why I never grew
That's why this for me even if I say you
That's why this for me even if I say her
That's why this for me even if I say him
I don't know why, sometimes I look for your face in the sky
More time I push them away
I write cos I never used to know how to say it

[Chorus]
It's just how I feel right now
I don't really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear
It's just how I feel right now
I don't really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear

[Chorus]
We used to dance with the devil on a Saturday
Just so we could go and speak to God on a Sunday
You for me
Fear
You were my closest friend
And all I did for you is true
And I Iet you lie to me
But these walls won't fall for you

[Verse 1]
To touch the sky
I'm feeling butterflies
Conflicted by the black and white
Colours what you held inside
Who am I
In this world of clones
Living in each others shadows
Afraid to be the person that our youth mourns
I've stood here before
And I've watched my brothers fall
Their silence speaks volumes
I don't need to hear anymore
Lord I just pray for the sake of my family
Still sat by that window sill
In search of your gravity

[Bridge]
I'm feeling more lights are going out
Tell me who you wanna be
You're not the person I used to know
But I'm unsure to let you go
There was some more of the truth
I didn't find
And if it's you then it's me
Turn your back

[Verse 2]
I've seen people change
And walk into different worlds
The past we framed
And left to dust by the window sill
This was never for you
I wrote this when I was 9
People fail to see your truths
I see the man beyond the blind
This pen in my hand
The shadow of mind
I never envied you once
I'm here for what's mine
My mum taught me family first
Don't try and be anyone else
I'm still the man of that house
God knows my presence is felt

[Chorus]
We used to dance with the devil on a Saturday
Just so we could go and speak to God on a Sunday
You for me
Fear
You were my closest friend
And all I did for you is true
And I Iet you lie to me
But these walls won't fall for you

[Bridge]
I'm feeling more lights are going out
Tell me who you wanna be
You're not the person I used to know
But I'm unsure to let you go
There was some more of the truth
I didn't find
And if it's you then it's me
Turn your back

She, she meant
My necessary friend
In need
She'll be there

I don't need a speech
Know you'll never leave, I
Just need your belief, this time
I don't need you to say
Do or die cause anyway
I know that
You'll be there

No sleep, no strings
No sense ending in heartbreak
Trust you, trust me
You'll be there when I'm falling
Cut deep, cutscene
Hold my hand when I'm driving
Just sleep, choose me
Just like back when we started
Just like back when we started
Just like back when we started

(10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

Stay, stay a while
If you've the time
Hold me in
Don't be scared

No sleep, no strings (I don't need a speech)
No sense ending in heartbreak (Know you'll never leave, I)
Trust you, trust me (Just need your belief, this time)
You'll be there when I'm falling
Cut deep, cutscene (I don't need you to say)
Hold my hand when I'm driving (Do or die cause anyway)
Just sleep, choose me (I know that)
You'll be there (Just like back when we started) (10, 9, 8, 7)

I miss you (6, 5)
And we should talk soon (4, 3)
Bye (2, 1)

[Intro]
If you fall, I'll catch you

[Verse 1]
So I've been thinking 'bout something
Lately I've been alive
'Cause I found my reason in nothing
So I won't close my eyes
'Cause I don't want to miss one second
And I don't want to feel so cold
And I don't want to be so sad that we are who we are
'Cause we had no control

[Pre-Chorus]
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame
When we've only ourselves to blame

[Chorus]
So I won't sleep
No more
No, I won't sleep
No more
I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
No more
Like I could always
No DMT won't stop me
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
Dream
No more
(Dream no more)

[Verse 2]
So get this doubt out of my head
It's only real if you let it
And I've been letting go of my ghosts
I'll never let them catch me no more
But these words are all I have
So I'll just keep dreaming out loud
And if I just keep talking
Maybe I'll figure all this out

[Pre-Chorus]
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame
And we've only ourselves to blame

[Chorus]
So I won't sleep
No more
No, I won't sleep
No more
I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
No more
Like I could always
No DMT won't stop me
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
Dream
No more

Breaking through the line
You and I, it's not setting in
Knew I shouldn't but I did
Trying to save what I could't see
These feelings stretch into the mountains
And the sun sets behind it
Took your perspective and I stretched it
You bring out the weakness I'm surpressing
The sea is cold, how did we get here
The world turns away as I kiss you
Something new
Feel the past fade
Everything we once knew
I found myself in this
Waiting, while nothing burns everything
Until everything rises again
No frame for this view
I'm lost down there in the noise just like you
But now I see a yellow dress
My past behind you it so slowly sets

I heard trust doesn't grow it only withers

I told you that we're done, staring at the ceiling from the sky
You forced it out of me, this went much better in my..
I like to be alone
Too much
Some would say
Voices in my head, running relay
Mood Moving like, a ballet duet
Beautiful for you I reckon ...
Beautiful for you I reckon

Watching till the concrete sets in...

I used to want it all
I laugh about it now
Scared to lose the light when it's fading
Now I dance in the darkness
Can't you see me I'm up (I'm up)
Watch you fade away
The fuck I'm reaching for when it stays here
Minutes from nowhere

Uhhh...

For now, you're feeling waves
Look, no nothing's saved
Still I'm losing time
Keep tryna hit play
Felt light climbing
Capsizing
Dark shadows on my silver lining
Just me now
I turn away from
Fuck I'm selfish init
I know you think it
But still you
Fell for me, fell for me, fell for me
I got nothing else, but you're still with me, still with me, still with me
Heard that a boy drowned .....
Screamed it all but no sound
Hit something must be the ground
I'm Falling through and I'm jaded...
Blue lights but they're late
Eyes glazed, I won't change
Walk through myself in this maze
How did you get here, I'm amazed

Said it at the same time
Running on some lost time
Pushing through the headlights

Who you gonna be now...

I be making waves, as I'm reaching for the next sky
Everything, everything I done prayed
She could never see it in the same light
I'ma stay here til the sun up
I'ma be here one more night
Ain't breathed out in a couple years
And I'm finna move back to the west side
She gone play like it ain't me
The silence heavy till we catch eye
Need to keep going till I'm back home
Until I start thinking about next time

Next time...

Yo
Thing is I don't really care that much anymore
Don't swear that much anymore
Don't text back much anymore
I'm Just calm, don't really care for
Anything much
I let it fall
I turn around
It's all behind glass
What's even yours
She say she mine
I've heard that all before

Your words perfectly chosen
You were so closed
You were open to me
Lights off but it's open
That long hall
To the trenches
Sky falls
And I bench it .........

I don't really care that much anymore
Don't swear that much anymore
Don't text back much anymore

I'm Just calm, don't really care for
Nothing much, I let it fall
I turn around
It's all behind glass
Watch it fall (What?)
What's even yours

Yours words perfectly chosen
You were so closed
You were open to me
Lights off but it's open
That long hall
To the trenches
The sky falls
And I bench it .........

Sky falls and I bench it

Pushed you away and blame you
What an easy lie
Zoomed out to the truth
Don't believe what u hear
Walls closing in on this booth

[Intro: ATO]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Her eyes are to the camera
She tryna find her way to the other side
She tryna find the answer
To the good life
The more money, she's addicted to the money tree
And she don't know who she can be
She tryna find herself inside of me, yeah
And if she wants to go alone, we can play that game
She done it once before, but it's never been the same
She's afraid of change, I don't know why

[Verse 1: ATO]
Popping more than bottles
Just a couple homeless models
On a red-eye from Atlanta
Drinking wine until it landed
She's tryna be more than twisted panties on this bedroom floor
Heart set on dior
Alexander Wang, she wants it all
Told her now
"Keep the lights off, love the dark
Take the tights off, if you want me come and get me
You ain't going home tonight."
Feeling the emotions, got the motion running double time
Seeing double, wondering which girl is coming home with me tonight

[Chorus: EDEN]
And I got a notion
Everything's going fine
'Cause we stand for nothing
And they say that faith is blind
And it's always brighter on the other side
It's a fine line
Between bliss and open eyes

[Verse 2: ATO]
Fuck the system, more controversial than collaborating two religions
Remain the realest in the building
Under these conditions I've been kicking since my time was ticking
And without a finish line, how can I now define winning?
Looking major, but fuck your pen and fuck your paper
And if it compromises mine, the only sign is that I shouldn't sign
Sharp shadows circles 'round my spine
Only friend is time this time like every time before
Just like her, I'm proudly putting London on the map
Don't hold me back, scream up West, where my motherfuckers at?
[?]
Hypocrisy that exists among these cold rappers, it's an epidemic of Y.M.C.M.B
Can't fuck with me though
I'm trying to take your girl, yes, Childish Gambino
I hold my chest knowing the bullets for my head and ego
I'm at the edge screaming, "Don't hold me back," while the ledge breaks
And I feel no weight as I make this great escape
You know I'm hating on these rappers
I don't feel these rappers
Some of them are real but most are sour sweets beneath the wrapper
Feeling poor, but rest assured I'm bringing something new
Hear the game's broken, I'm reminded that its rent is due
I've got it all, down to the last penny
Down to the last depressive night alone drinking Henny
I keep it real to me, you know what's real to me is real for you
Writing like tomorrow will never come true at ten to midnight
I'm rolling over, twenty now and I'm killing
Thirty-two bars a minute but guarantee your mind will still be ticking
When I'm finished going over ninety miles per hour
Burning through this track gaining more flack than Dwight Howard
I don't trust her, trust breaks in a second
Love used as a weapon was never what we intended
But don't forget, now that it's been addressed
It's what we don't do, not what we do, we ultimately regret

[Alan Watts - What If Money Was No Object]
You will spend your life completely wasting your time
You will be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living - that is to go on doing things you don't like doing
Which is stupid
Better to have a short life full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way

[Unnamed housewife]
I can't tell you about it
If you can't see it, then you'll never know it
I feel sorry for you


[Verse 1]
You been confusing since the day I met you
Another night chasing, this feels like home
Since I've been miles away, no change
Outsider inside looking dazed
Just wash the glitter off your face and go home
Winter sun throwing shadows long and lonesome
How strange to think that we were strangers once
At square one
I guess it's on me, I want more than I've got
But I can't ask you for the things you don't feel
Don't-

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
I don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles, or favors
And I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say, yeah

[Chorus]
And I'll still be there
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
'Cause I've got nowhere else, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she told me love me fast but take it slow
I said I'm going nowhere fast as hell
And keeping with the times we gotta keep it on the low
Midnight habits burning through the summer since the snow, and
I finally feel myself again
It's been so long, I thought I'd seen the end
But I guess you need ends to begin again
And again, and again
'Cause this is nothing we ain't seen before
I lived through it, I ain't overdosed
The sky is falling like it always does
So I guess we'll see if someone's watching over us
So let it rain
The clouds look heavy, but they bear no weight
The scars can't hurt you and the bruises will fade, yes


[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
I don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles, or favors
And I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

[Chorus]
And I'll still be there
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
'Cause I've got nowhere else

[Outro]
And I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
I don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles, or favors
And I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say, yeah

You've been confusing since the day I met you
Another night chasing, this feels like home
Since I've been miles away from change
Outside or inside looking dazed
Just wash the glitter off your face and go home

And this enthralling shadow's gone, ghost town
It's strange to think that we were strangers once
It's square one
I guess it's something where I want more than I've got
But I can't ask you for the things you don't feel

Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

And I'll still be here
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
Cause I've got no hope

Yeah
She told me love me fast or take it slow
I said I'm going nowhere fast as hell
And keeping with the times we gotta keep it on the low
Midnight habits burning through the summer since the snow and
I finally feel myself again
It's been so long, I thought I'd see the end
I guess you need ends to begin again
Again, again


Cause this is nothing we ain't seen before
Lived through it I ain't overdosed
The sky is falling like it always does
Can't you see a storm's watching over us
Let it rain
The clouds look heavy, but they bare no weight
Scars can't hurt you, bruises will fade

Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

And I'll still be here
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
Cause I've got no hope

Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

[Spoken Word]
We're just veering, backwards at times, just to get through some of the stuff, and it's just crazy, all the things that we have to do, uh, it's just crazy
We're gonna keep going, and, see what happens
Thanks for following along
We still remain optimistic, and are, persevering towards our-

[Chorus]
Dancing on my own
My feet are drawn to you
And lost at every sound
My heart can't fade it

[Verse 1]
Mama said, "Why you gotta waste my time?"
I threw it to the wind, no line
It's something that I need, no crime
The call can't reconnect this time and
The substances we craved subsided
I never want to live half sided, no

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
But still I persist on
I feel like we're orphaned
My halo got all bent
I hate how I feel and
I'm not falling
But I say nothing
I say nothing

[Bridge]
No, I can't believe you wanted me
I cannot see the lining here
I fall asleep to sounds of dreams of you
You're losing me, losing me
Don't lose me
Don't lose grip on me
Feelings down on me
Heart beatdown on me
On me, on me

[Verse 3]
Staring at the screen but I feel no way
Bleeding through to real life, fucking up the wave
I can make you feel but could never make you stay
What do you want from me?
What do I hope to see?
I haven't been home in weeks

[Break]
Still, I can feel loved for now
And I can accept the paths I've taken
And if all this dies out I'll be good
Still, I'm down and

[Chorus]
Dancing on my own
My feet are drawn to you
And lost at every sound
My heart can't fade it

[Verse]
Just a little bit more, bite the bullet before
It was written on the back of the bedroom door
And it will keep going and the world still turns
If it's easier said than done, I'm sure
These things that been pullin' me in
But I begin to break the hold
There it goes

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know you anymore
But did I ever, maybe never saw through
Just an idea, just an idea

[Chorus]
And I know that this projection has been slipping away
Building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up

Just an-

[Verse]
Never break
When I bring it to the brink
When I bring it never bright
When I bring it to the brink
Then I bring it right back
When I bring it to the brink
And I see it, never break
When I see it, never saw it, 'til I bring it to the break

[Verse]
Just a little bit more, bite the bullet before
It was written on the back of the bedroom door
And it will keep going and the world still turns
If it's easier said than done, I'm sure
These things that been pullin' me in
But I begin to break the hold
There it goes

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know you anymore
But did I ever, maybe never saw through
Just an idea, just an idea

[Chorus]
And I know that this projection has been slipping away
Building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up

...I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up

[Verse]
Never break
When I bring it to the brink
When I bring it never bright
When I bring it to the brink
Then I bring it right back
When I bring it to the brink
And I see it, never break
When I see it, never saw it, 'til I bring it to the break
When I'm out
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes, and it goes

[Verse]
Touch me and slip away
I can't hide feeling out of place
I can't function, oh my mistake
Thought you were someone I once knew

[Chorus]
I was light years ahead of me
Thoughts in my head don't disappear
I was a maybe (A maybe)
That made you the truth

[Refrain]
In time I will come to see it for how it really was
In my mind, it's only false faces whisper, "Love you"
If that feeling had a price then I would gladly pay it over and over and over 'til I'm broke
And if you held me for ransom I'd love it, I'd never wanna go home
But all this hypothetical thinking is digging me down (Down)
And maybe I was seconds away but it doesn't matter now
Heat death only seconds away, so no, it don't matter now

[Verse]
Touch me and slip away
I can't hide feeling out of place
I can't function, oh my mistake
Thought you were someone I once knew, woah, yeah

[Chorus]
There's light years ahead of me
Voices in my head don't disappear
I was a maybe (A maybe)
That made you the truth

[Refrain]
In time I will come to love it for how it really was
In my mind, it's only false faces whisper, "See you"
If that feeling had a price then I would gladly pay it over and over and over 'til I'm broke
And if you held me for ransom I'd love it, I'd never wanna go home
But all this hypothetical thinking is digging me down, down
And maybe I was seconds away but it doesn't matter now
Heat death only seconds away, so no, it don't matter now

[Verse 1: ATO]

And now you're questioning the decisions I'm making lately
Said that's rich coming from someone who barely gave me a penny
If you were here you'd understand my reflection
'Cause standing over there gives you an ill-informed perception

Of who I am, who I'm meant to be and the couches between
'Cause when you wake up is when I'll be living the dream
I've embarked upon this journey alone
Now I'm four years within the unknown but yet so lyrically grown

Shit
How did my life become like this
It's all a puzzle, drinking, I can find the answer in the bottom of this bottle
Life's a struggle
So we work just to work more
One the last floors has us falling through a thousand more
When the rich take less to the grave than the poor

My mum's calling my phone and I'm on the road
I take the call, she's low, saying she's been diagnosed
With the same shit that had me wear a black suit and tie
When my mother's mother said goodbye back in '99

There's a thin line between love and hate
And I see people cross the border every day
And I see people hustling to find change
In the pursuit to find change

All I know is
Ato, come home
Ato ain't ready, Ato needs to get more
The hourglass's pressure ain't resistant
Thoughts of pessimism
Despite all these feelings be the rhythm to the way I'm living

And if you find a diamond in the dirt
A broken bridge by a river, or a sinner by a church
Trust I know life is too short
To not give time to a possibility without hope

[Chorus]

Young guy, you don't know why
Living in the city where they leave you by the roadside
All I know in the place where I've grown is
I don't wanna be like him

Young guy, you don't know why
Living in the city where they leave you by the roadside
All I know in the place where I've grown is
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna

[Verse 2: ATO]

Think about you, drink about you
I tried with you, but you pushed me away
Way deeper into yesterday
Hold up where you going, you best not be playing games
One fight away from changing this picture inside this frame

See when you go is not back to my usual
Young artistic nigga in the city with that pencil full of pain
Into walking in the rain
And the raindrops they fall heavy for me
It's funny, feel like it's Gods way of tryna speak to me

Well that's what I feel
Feel what I imagine is real
Just a flower in this field
Tryna find my way between
The pretty lady's finger and thumb
And she's God
Cause she controls the feelings I've got

But I've got so much on my brain these days
I feel the waves getting far too big to handle
[Fail] to turn this shit the other way
Sail back to the harbor like your average Joe and play it safe
But that's not life it's not what I chose

The Romans made these roads that I refuse to follow populated with people that don't see past the tip of their nose
In the process lost a place called home
Lost myself
Lost my girl
Feel as if I'm alone staring at the park

There's a billion people that feel the same
Life is how you see it and I see it as a frame
The picture that it holds becomes clear on your final days
Pray it's never my choice to choose to give the brush away

[Chorus: ATO]

Young guy, you don't know why
Living in the city where they leave you by the roadside
All I know in the place where I've grown is I don't wanna be like him

Young guy, you don't know why
Living in the city where they leave you by the roadside
All I know in the place where I've grown is
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna

[Verse 3: ATO]

That's when I realized I'd rather have real enemies than fake friends
Be true to me than lying cheating on Sunday, say Amen
I keep spinning the world on the tip of my fingers
[Stressing] the waves
Causing tsunamis
Killing them masses
Watching em pray
Twenty four hours a day

Just to test em
If I stop it, wonder who calls it a blessing
Wonder who sees the disaster
Wonder who can see the lesson
But my left hand keeps on spinning it
I'm out of control
My eyes reflecting the cadence with no intention to close

And now you're questioning the decisions I'm making lately
Said that's rich coming from someone who barely gave me a penny
If you were here you'd understand my reflection
Cause standing over there gives you an ill informed perception
Of who I am, who I'm meant to be, and the couches between
Cause when you wake up is when I'll be living the dream

(Ato, have you been up all night?)

[2015]
And if these days were living encores, encore
Then and tell me, do you scream?
Even when every thing's a nightmare
It's something we've all seen
'Cause we let everyone we love fall down
Like a lead sky brings the night
And that's all we are
'Cause we get off on hiding everything we are
So tell me you love me
I will too
So tell me you loath me
I do too

[2011]
And I been thinking that
The more I grow
The more that I'll lose touch with what I love, and time it flows
So much faster than anything I've ever known
I've always been a dreamer
So what happens when I wake up?
I'm not afraid of growing older
I'm just afraid of letting go

[2017]
Um, I usually write a poem for each body of work I do
Or just randomly too, I guess
But yeah, here it is:
Stop
You are not broken
There is no fix
There is a change
You are not your job, your significant other, the numbers in your bank account, the thoughts or the memories in your head
What ever anyone says: whatever
You are the words you speak, the way you move
This can change at any time as you decide
Choose wisely
Does your love mean anything if I can't feel it?
If I threw myself off a building am I a martyr or a tragedy?
However you may feel momentarily, only two factors persevere:
Your relationship to the people around you, and your view of yourself
You could buy that x if you wanted to
But think about it, if you came home like you did would it change a thing?
You are inconstant, dynamic
You're a star darling, act like one
Take care of the ones that you love
Stop being so serious
Now is not forever
But you knew all this, deep down
Maybe we are forever ending where we started
But it is only the end if you want it to be
Everything is only ever what you would like it to be;
Never as great or as grave as it seems
No matter how close or how impossibly far you think you got to that greener grass
We just have to try again
We just have to try again

[Music video intro]
I don't know, I just remember being so much brighter.... I guess
Yeah, it's a weird thing, like, I don't know hehe uhm... I definitely feel like I'm at the beginning of all this and I want it to be really beautiful uhm, and I guess that's the best way to look at it. Just take it


[Verse 1]
So tell me this is who you are
They tell me I've got something more
And oh, "you could be loved"
But I don't want the lights to find me when I'm dark and lost
But never on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna swing like Sinatra
Singing like I can't stop
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I just wanna live like the ones before, yeah
And maybe I could play guitar like Hendrix
Or save the world or end it
And then maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
That's all I want

[Verse 2]
So I got ten minutes to be all or nothing to
Whoever wants to hear
And I got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat 'till I'm burnt out and disappear
But I owe you nothing
And I own my luck
Oh, they said "you'll never be alone again"
But I don't think you understand me or what I fear
"But you could be loved"
But I don't wanna lie to tell myself
I'm more than all the mistakes I've outrun

[Verse 3]
'Cause I'm only here for a minute
And I don't care what you say 'cause I know
You're only here 'cause I'm winning
But I can be my own kind of rock and roll
I don't really care if you say you don't fuck with me
And I can say what the fuck I want 'cause it's down to me
And I got love for you even if you are doubting me
Like, oh my God, I just can't stop

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna sing like Sinatra
With ethanol my soundtrack
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I wonder how it feels to burn out young, yeah
'Cause I just wanna die before my heart fails
From heartbreak or cocktails and
Then maybe you'll cry once you know I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
Oh, that's all I want, yeah

[Bridge]
'Cause I ain't scared of livin'
Does it get easier?
No... yes, it gets easier
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Oh yeah?
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Look at you

[Outro]
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll - that's all I want
'Cause it's all we've got
What are we breathin' for if we ain't living?
What's under the words you know - that's all I want
And I don't want your love
I just wanna feel like I'm still livin'
Something more than superficial is all I want
And if there is no god
I know the day I die, I lived through heaven
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll - that's all I want
And that I gave it hell
And if it hurt, oh well
At least that's living
The more you know who you are and what you want...
That's all I want
...the less you let things upset you
That's all I want
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be, you know?
I tried being a writer but I hate what I write
And I tried taking pictures but they were so mediocre
You know, and every girl goes through a photography phase
You know, like horses, you know, take, uh, dumb pictures of your feet
You'll figure that out - I'm not worried about you

[Extended]
If all we had is time then we'll be alright
It's not much but it's better than nothing
Sex, drugs and rock and roll that's all I want
What's under the words you know that's all I want
Something more than superficial is all I want
Sex, drugs and rock and roll that's all I want


[Verse 1]
Speaking of another life
I can't unfold our
Heartbreak from another time
Four seconds too long
In my head I get caught, I suppose
Just wishing I won't let her mind
Alright

[Pre-Chorus]
So we can fly away
Wondering way out loud 'till my thoughts say so
Just to ride the wave
I think I move too fast, enough to take it slow

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, running, tripping
I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
But maybe I'll get somewhere, fast, fast

[Verse 2]
'Cause speaking of another lie, just to make times last
'Cause speaking of another love died, all just typecast
Say I fall in love too fast
For my own good
Good, good, good


[Pre-Chorus]
We can run away
I'll move 'till I die, enough to take it slow
Just to ride the wave
We're moving too fast, enough to take

[Chorus]
'Cause I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, running
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
But maybe I'll get somewhere, fast, fast

[Verse 1]
So rushing in and rushing out again
Another martyr anon
So you can wake up and start again
From stardust to god
And maybe in another man's life
On another man's time
Maybe the time's just not right for us
Maybe this is all that we are, are

[Chorus]
The lives I've loved
Too close to know
The hindsight song
There's no way I'd rather wait than know

[Verse 2]
The highs we trade for the lows
Just gotta wake up and start again
'Cause this is no place like home
And if you could've stayed there you would've
Could've, should've
Another life I had known
Maybe the time would be right for us
But this is all that we got
Our luck

[Chorus]
The lives I've loved
And too close to know
Chasing, but at what cost?
Just 'cause there's no way I'd rather wait than know?


[Verse 1]
And I said what's up?
What you been thinking?
'Cause you've been staring at that roof so long
I'd swear it's come alive
And she spoke nine words
And now we're sinking
But I can't find it in myself to want to lie
To keep this thing from going down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that girl took my heart
And I ain't want it back
No
I'm laying down my cards

[Verse 2]
'Cause you said it meant nothing
And I should've kept my silence
But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know
That all these words meant nothing
And I've always been this heartless
And we're just having sex, no, I would never call it love
But love

[Chorus]
Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?


[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
So I guess it's
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
Let die to let live

[Verse 3]
And what's good
When both choices I've got
Have us staring down the barrel to the bullets I can't stop?
And so I stand off
Like indecision's Kevlar
'Til this fear of feeling stops and I'm done
But you

[Interlude]
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you

[Pre-Chorus]
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
'Cause that girl took my heart
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
And I ain't want it back, no
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
A bulletproof restart


[Chorus]
Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
So I guess it's
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
Let die to let live

[Outro]
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you

[Chorus]
But baby, it's cold outside, I don't wanna go
Rushing thoughts to the back of my mind
From the end of the road

[Verse]
Always thought I'd find peace in that life
Now I've nowhere to go
Chasing shadows across those blue skies, my heroes
We'll watch the radio blur
As my hands move fast to the mirror
Been fighting off cold sweats
And waking up soaked again
I couldn't fake it if I tried
I couldn't fake it if I
If I-

[Chorus]
'Cause baby it's cold outside, I don't wanna go
Rushing thoughts to the back of my mind
From the end of the world, woah

[Outro]
Look, baby, I gotta go
'Cause I'm dying for it
So If you love me don't let me go
'Cause I'm dying for it
If you love me don't let me go
'Cause I'm dying for it
If you love me don't let me go
'Cause I'm-

[Intro: I Have A Dream]

I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history...

[Verse 1: ATO]

I guess it's okay
Not to be okay
You walk by the sea in a hope to get washed away
And not wake again to the same pain that you felt yesterday
And the day before
Man that's deep
But even your friends don't know how deep it is
Until they're burying a body six feet in shit

Uh, yeah
Life is about that love
Life is about that person
Who's all that you need and want
It's funny how my darkest moment
Brought my mom and dad to speak
I could look at that in either way
But what's the point, I'll leave it be

I'm just tryna find positives in these negatives
And now I know why they taught us maths in school
Cause when you add it all up maths is all that we do
I just need time
To figure my self out
Add a few things in
Subtract a few things out

Life has just been complicated
For me and all those who can relate this
This is more than just money issues
I'm talking picking up mummy's tissues
So what do they know about me
What do they know about me
On the low
But they seem to say a lot and I'm hearing things I didn't know

[Refrain: ATO]

I'm just sat in a field
One drunk man walking past but he can't see me
Sun retreats and gives way to the stars
I'm just looking for something different

Just sat in a field
Walking past he can't see me
Sun retreats and gives way to the stars
I'm just looking for something different

[Verse 2: ATO]

RIP
To Maddie, Ben and the Akash's fathers
It's down to you, that I've been speaking to mine and trying harder
I feel like I'm deep
But I wanna be deeper
My mum's tellin' me that I should find a girl
But I haven't found myself and It's getting darker


I found something in Paris
Something I don't wanna see again
The coldest of people
Early smiles are often deceitful
I'm so grateful
I didn't grow up in Chelsea
I don't know about those silver spoons or the other side of that Bentley

People would try and sell your dreams
Don't believe them
Until you see that
And your bank account feel that

People would try and sell your dreams
Don't believe them
Until you see that
And your bank account feel that

[Refrain: ATO]

I'm just sat in a field
One drunk man walking past but he can't see me
Sun retreats and gives way to the stars
I'm just looking for something different

Just sat in a field
One drunk man walking past he can't see me
Sun retreats and gives way to the stars
I'm just looking for something different tonight

[Outro: I Have A Dream]

We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism...

[Intro]
What the fuck is in the end when there ain't peace?

[Verse 1]
Waste time, the time's never right (uh)
The pink like, speedlight, crash 25
Have me think twice in this black, white (okay)
Rewind, silence echos to our last night
Watch the sky fall (fall), drown in the city of sin
The devil sleeps light where the river bends
Tried to hold my breath, you brought up '94
Pullin' off the M-Way, kicking out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Skate all these walls and these ceilings you brining
I feel these people wanna try and take the light out of me
Take the dark out of me
I'm so alive, made you feel alive
You can't define me

[Chorus]
All sold out of paradise
You shoulda stuck around
And the sun don't set on the rest of us (yeah)
Heard you got to thinking you're god now, poor soul (poor soul)
I pour that shit all over the ace (ace)


[Verse 2]
This time was too close (too close)
Now we're both unafraid to lose it all (yeah)
My head light, feel the lights goin'
She loved you but couldn't see where the light falls
Follow the blue, time, blue
Her world upside down tryna shake the truth
Feel a wave, waves, it's the same, same
Will I ever change?
Burning through this paper
I'll make it all back later
I'll turn out just like you, before it's done we should make up
Oh god damn
From the day, from the jump, from the outside, been some outliers, raised in the riots
Heard they looking for something, nothing or something
Are you here for the Truman Show
This way for

[Pre-Chorus]
I skate all these walls and these ceilings you brining
I feel these people wanna try and take the light out of me
Take the dark out of me
I'm so alive, made them feel alive
They can't hold me if I lose myself
How far the fuel goes, I keep the lights low
Follow the white lines through the dark night and to the devils eyes, shadow of moonlight
Good morning


[Chorus]
All sold out of paradise
You shoulda stuck around
And the sun don't set on the rest of us
Heard you got to thinking you're god now, poor soul
I pour that shit all over the- fucks sake

[Verse 3]
Who do you think you are?
Passenger side of a fast car
Halfway between two roads
Used to be scared of the blue, like I was fallin' through now I'm just numb to the pain
Sometimes I wonder if I'm losing myself
But tell me whats to lose when my wrist is on loop
Take time, don't move and watch it all rush back
Guess this is who I'm gonna be
Everything barely underneath my feet
They used to tell me "Ato just breathe"
Tried to get off the train while it was moving
Look to my eyes, couldn't see what I see
Embarrassed at how I feel
Such a big deal, all in my head
Like what even is the truth

[Outro]
Right, right now
Right now
Right, right now
Right now
Right, right now
Right now
Right, right now
Right now

What the fuck is in the-

Watch you fall in love with the other side

Bare shy when you met me for the first time
I just watched your city turn into the sky
Didn't feel the moment until it landed though
Something great out there
You saw it on my mind
Used to be my world now you're a distant star
Obsessed with the past but you ain't finished living
Coz everything and nothing as we're zooming out
Everything is nothing when I close my eyes

She's breathing like she wanna say something
I hear your thoughts
Running, tripping n falling
Only to afford me a lie
Twenty more minutes almost missed my flight..

24 of life
25 and breathe
Could have been more but we couldn't see
Ayo Ayo..

Falling further into the sky
Through these fears. I'm feeling alive
There's a feeling I can't shake
Falling in Circles
In Circles

It's just us in the backroom
25 nights
Us in the purple fire fucking up the mood
Try and hold paradise
Missed it by design
Yeah I have feelings that you never took right
Ye you could be my girl and we could run the night..

Think about it
I feel alive
Killing time

You're never far from anything (1-2 Yeah)
You make waves just to feel alive
This smile runs deeper than you
But I think I like you more than the last time..

So maybe we should go out
Lost track of time
Made me a little late
Got a flight in the morning but that can fucking wait
When I leave, turn ghost, I'll be back again
I like this
I know you feel the same
See you in London
That's the second date
Zooming out two times on a new frame
My nigga's on fire and it's all pain
How am I gonna rush what I can't say
Rain on my window made me think again
Letting go
And let it all fall again
It's always...

24 of life
25 and breathe
Could have been more but we couldn't see
Ayo Ayo

Falling further into the sky
Through these fears. I'm feeling alive
There's a feeling I can't shake
Falling in Circles
In Circles

It's just us in the backroom
25 nights
Us in the purple fire fucking up the mood
Try and hold paradise
Missed it by design
Yeah I have feelings that you never took right
Ye you could be my girl and we could run the night..

Think about it
I feel alive
Killing time

[Verse 1]
You try to kill it but it won't stop bleeding
Try to forget it but it won't stop killing you
You're running out of time
Yeah, you know you can't go back
It's too late
To say it's too late
You can't take back that you said nothing
How could you do nothing?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this burning right?
Am I living bridges?
Can we build our past right?
Learning through future solecism

[Chorus 1]
(I've missed times) It's played out
(Been disconnected) I've moved on
(I stressed time) Get fucked up
(Forgetting timing) My new draw
(And I need you to talk me down) And it's not right
You're dead wrong ('cause I feel like I need to crash)
What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong

[Bridge]
'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong
Been looking at the sky like someone was looking down
But it keeps raining on me
And I've been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old
Been looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone
And the fault's not ours alone
But I think it's time to go

[Chorus 2 (Over Bridge)]
It's played out
I've moved on
Get fucked up
My new draw
And it's not right
You're dead wrong
What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong

[Verse 2]
And I've got way too many questions just to try and get it right
'Cause I can't be the one to shrug it off
And I could be the reason that we stay up all night
To be someone, to be someone
And oh, all we've got is to try to get it right
But no one told you
That this gon' hurt, oh no
And now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream

[Verse 3]
That shit just to try and find a way to get my head down
And head out or maybe just the two of us and head now
I'm just tryna find the real now
Dream clouds, ghost ground
Real friends, dead hometown

[Bridge]
'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong
Been looking at the sky like someone was looking down
But it keeps raining on me
When I been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old
Been looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone
And it breaks my heart, you know
But I think it's time to go

[Chorus 2 (Over Bridge)]
It's played out
I've moved on
Get fucked up
My new draw
And it's not right
You're dead wrong
What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong

[Verse]
Shuffle in the dark
I'm throwing out parts and time
Is always changing
Particles spin down
Separated lust, yeah
Couple seconds up
You want something that ain't coming back to that
But it really don't matter how bad you want me
How you found me
I can't keep up with/afford just being a static
Design

[Verse 1]
Uh
My heart yearns for escape
I spoke my truth, until it turned me away
You're talking about some feelings you've been holding for months
Had me question myself, and had me question your trust

I took a prick from that rose
These words got me thinking about the nights we were close
They wanna hear me rap from the depths of my soul
But I'm about to blow a bag and fill it with clothes

I heard they looking for that new ambition
Well all my brothers in the new editions
Stepping out, you looking at us different
Louis Vuitton, he wants some new religions

I paint this world black from the inside
They just want to hear this from the inside
More life, more lights, feel the moments, if I try
I ain't feeling myself
'Till we make it two five

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm fine, I'm nice like that
You know those nights like that
You feel those blinds go back
You feel the lights go black

You know those nights like that
I get those Nikes like that
Feel God on nights like this
I need those nights like that

I got a feeling that I know how you feel like
I'ma take a trip, but I'll be yours for the meanwhile
Fallen out of love, two times
But that's alright
We can go all night, no lie

[Chorus]
And Its okay, I don't mind
You can't hit the rewind
Fallen 'bout 4 or 5 times
I'm still running away from it (Sundown)
It's okay, I don't mind
You can't hit the rewind
Fallen 'bout 4 or 5 times
I'm still running away

[Verse 2]
30 floors, the closest edge
Take in this city
Hold my breath

Breaking family ties
How many times, we gon' lose this light
Give me a sign, feeling the pressure rise
Through this breeze
Held up the skies to find the strength to believe
Should've been my big brother, but he looked over me

How should I feel about the way that ended
Guess If my brother said it
I shouldn't second guess it?

I'm tryna re-imagine God like Nietzsche
I lost my way to find my only believer
The music just a vehicle for my subconscious
My mother says she love when my smile frames my demeanor

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm fine, I'm nice like that
You know those nights like that
You feel those blinds go back
You feel the lights go black

You know those nights like that
I get those Nikes like that
Feel God on nights like this
I need those nights like that

I got the feelings, that I know how you feel like
I'ma take a trip, but I'll be yours for the meanwhile
Fallen out of love, two times
But that's alright
We can go all night, no lie

[Chorus]
And Its ok I don't mind
You can't hit the rewind
Fallen bout 4 or 5 times
I'm still running away from it (Sundown)
It's ok, I don't mind
You can't hit the rewind
Fallen bout 4 or 5 times
I'm still running away

[Intro]
I got a feeling last night
You were on your way over
Walking the line of the cracks in the road
If I had thought to read the signs
I could've maybe bought time
But now you keep your leaking eyes to the floor
Collider feel
I'm running, keep my lines on track
And pushing through
Said you'd never come back

[Verse]
But don't you want to watch it die?
Collapse in for you now
I'm pulling the time back (Time)
I just want to watch it die
Can't stop now anyway
Can't shake the thought of
When I close my eyes you're

[Chorus]
Walking out the door, ooh (I still see you)
Know you needed something more (I see you see through me)
Walking out the door, ooh (I wish you said it to me)
Know you needed something more (I)

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna watch it die
Can't stop now anyway
Can't shake the thought of
When I close my eyes you're

[Chorus]
Walking out the door, ooh-ooh-ooh (I still see you)
Know you needed something more (I see you see through me)
Walking out the door, ooh (I wish you said it to me)
Know you needed something more (I wish you said it to me)

[Verse]
Don't you want to watch it die?
Collapse in for you now (I wish you said it to me)
I- I'm pulling the time back (I wish you said it to me)
I just want to watch it die
Can't stop now anyway
Can't shake the thought of
When I close my eyes you're (I wish you said it to me)

[Verse 1: Crywolf]
I felt a break in a sacred place
Where your hands don't heal
These are the reasons you're ruled
By the things you feel

Out of  the deep waters and all their intricacies
This is the real face of all your enemies

[Verse 2: Crywolf]
I felt you escape into empty space
Where my heart can't feel
Down in that darkness
You met all the things you feared

And I knew
I knew there was nothing I could do

[Chorus: Crywolf]
Could you stomach it, anymore?
Could you stand to be a breath away?
Can you feel the way your face distorts?
Did you think that it could be this way?

I can hear you from behind the door
I can feel you from a mile away
As you're growing out of my control
Will you watch me as I fade away?

[Verse 3: EDEN]
You can't escape forever
Mistaking smoke for heaven's light
It's not follow or a fade to black and white

Oh, I could take you home
Pretend the best's still ahead
Maybe in the sun, you'll see
You got what you want, but not what you need

[Interlude: Crywolf]
If I'm afraid
Then you are the darkness that made me feel this way

[Chorus: Crywolf & EDEN]
Could you stomach it, anymore?
Could you stand to be a breath away?
Can you feel the way your face distorts?
Did you think that it could be this way?

I can hear you from behind the door
I can feel you from a mile away
As you're growing out of my control
Will you watch me as I fade away?

[Outro: Crywolf]
Bless my darkness, bless my light
I lost my soul in your skin tones, now
Bless my darkness, bless my light
I lost my soul in your skin tones, now
Bless my darkness, bless my light
I lost my soul in your skin tones, now

[Verse 1]
Yeah, how could you be so careless?
I sweat this, I swear
I think I'm losing my voice, I took no time to take care
I smashed my phone, but honestly
I feel relieved you can't reach me
Now I can exhale on my own

[Chorus]
What were you thinking? That night was a dream
At the top of your lungs, I've heard you scream in your sleep
And I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation
So, how much is enough gonna take? Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I got a number for you
I call it breaking, yeah
I've got a lover, baby
Don't need what you're giving me
More than what you think
Oh, love ain't love if it ain't rough
But, you're screaming

[Verse 2]
I've said it all
(Daydream of nights, sin and saviours)
I thought maybe you'd believe me 'cause I don't
(I saw a light at the end)
These days it's a cliche, I know
(And who am I supposed to be now?)
I have no words, no words
(It's ending)


[Bridge]
And if I could forget you, you know I would leave
I can't help myself from feeling all this is wasted on me
And I love the rain (love!), but I can't live in a storm
I've got more to come
Still learning to grow

[Chorus]
What were you thinking? That night was a dream
At the top of your lungs, I hear you screaming, no sleep
And I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation
So, how much is enough gonna take?
I got a lifetime to wait
Seconds can't bury me

[Verse]
A smell of gas in the smoking room
If I ignore it tell me you will too
House on fire, it's just me and you
Lend me your light, I'll ignite the fumes
On your couch a week or two
True care, I'd do the same for you
I'll be on my feet, said they would call me soon
For now smoke up and inhale the view

[Chorus]
It's all gone up
I sift through the ashes
I don't know what I'm even looking for
Some kind of evidence
(All that's left is paperwork)
(All that's left is the blue and white)
(All that's left misremembered words)
(All that's left is the flashing lights)
It's all burned out
And I search for the answer
I don't know what I should be looking for
Some kind of medicine

[Post-Chorus]
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it

[Chorus]
It's all gone up
I sift through the ashes
I don't know what I'm even looking for
Some kind of evidence
It's all gone up
It's all gone up
Medicine

[Post-Chorus]
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it
(I need you)
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it
I need you

[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was 'em bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 1]
See my momma cry too many tears
And we been broke like too many years
It ain't too many kids, a couple homies, there ain't too many there
And they all gotta eat, they got too many kids
Too many kids with no fathers, doing too many bids
Too many bids, judge gave them kids too many years
As soon as you get that money, that's as soon they appear
Assuming you 'em  owe something, they assuming you'll share
And yeah, I've been losin' touch with my family, it ain't the same
I should've gave my sister some money, but I made it rain
I should've hit the crib with my son and played a game
But instead I ended up at the jeweller to make a chain
It's a sad saying when you make money it make you change
Like four quarters, the fourth quarter, I make a lane
Shit, I had to walk for it they talkin' 'bout takin' trains
And takin' planes, I put the work in and made the name
But the question is

[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was them bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 2]
I never wanted to be like Mike, I wanted to be like Mitch
Now all the lil' niggas wanna be like this
I wear my chain in any city, let you see my shit
Cause I earned that, it's on me, I'mma keep my shit
I got blood on my money, ether in my soul
Do you know the feeling durin' Easter with no clothes?
Now it's stars in the ceiling, bringing ether out the Rolls
With the curtains on the windows, I'm just peekin' at my goals
Money made me iller, already was realer
Young kings killin' young kings over skrilla
That's why I ride around Mac on me like I was Miller
Or Reggie when I shoot for that three
They drop fetty, that's good money
Come to my city, we talk heavy and die young
When we get some paper, we cop Prezis and ride rim
20 inch rims for the dope boy
Sellin' that coke boy, trappin' on your note boy
Got that buy it all money, fuck I need a note for!?
In them school hallways, "fuck I need a note for!?"
We ain't wanna go to class, we was sellin' coke raw
The principal was coppin' too, hit him with a snowball

[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was them bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 3]
Lookin' for the intro
I was at the dealer lookin' for another Benzo
Matching kicks with my Kenzo, young nigga
Heart of a lion, hungry as hippo
When I was on my last, nobody ain't tell me shit though
Flow slicker than Crisco, niggas talkin', I get low
Do my thing, they jump back, know how that shit go
And they say I'm arrogant
I'm still eatin' steak with the asparagus
When I get that money like I married it
1 milly, 2 milly, 3 milly, buried it
Since they say I'm underground, I run that bitch like Harriet
Rolls Royce pushin' real slow like a chariot
Pull up on them niggas that doubted me, shit embarrassin'
I'mma real nigga with money, never cherish it
You a fake niggas with money, it's no comparison
Told me that I couldn't get signed when I was rappin' it
And told me I couldn't do songs when I was battlin'
They told me that I couldn't be trapper, I started trapping' it
Never listen to 'em, oh well, shit is immaculate
I'mma just go sit up in this Bach again
Smoke the weed and laugh at them
Make a couple million by accident
Couple niggas dropped on Twitter, they say they back again
Couple months later on Twitter they say us laxative
Shitted on 'em, Nicki voice, did it on 'em Benjamins
Plently of 'em Benjamins, semi on him and he on a
Whole 'nother level from before now
Tell my niggas when I see a hundred mil its going down
When I made my first mil, I was like "it's on now"
Then I made my second mil, money on the floor now
Then I made my third mil, I'm like "I need more now?"
I got in my zone and that money started pourin' down
Every time I hit the booth, microphone torn down
We couldn't get a pair of Pumas, we up in the store now, bitches!

[Verse 1: Jeremy Zucker]
I was unimportant
You were just a friend
No one even noticed
We would just pretend

[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
But oh god, this sucks
Always, you're thinking too much
Baby, slow down, realize
There's more here for you
You

[Verse 2: Jeremy Zucker]
I was on the border
You were choosing sides
Kiss me in the morning
Miss me in the night

[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
But oh god, we suck
Always, we're thinking too much
Baby, slow down, realize
There's more here for you

[Post-Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
You're thinking too much, baby
(You)
You're thinking too much, baby
(You)
Slow down, take time
You're always thinking too much, baby
(You)
Slow down, realize, yeah realize, yeah

[Bridge: Jeremy Zucker]
Our light is fading
But you look amazing
And my mind is racing
We're all losing patience
I might as well fake it
Since acting's your favorite
Thought this was vacation
I won't keep you waiting
(Won't keep you waiting)

[Verse 3: EDEN & Jeremy Zucker]
We ran in fours to the sunrise
Counting down, come down
Two down in one try
One to go before it burns out
(And my mind is racing)
Past blurs but it's sun drenched
Path turns on its own bent
(We're all losing patience)
Seems less when you know better
And better off for it
(I might as well fake it)
Scarred skies like a road map
One second I thought and I was sure of it
(Since acting's your favorite)
At some point it'll come back
Just don't wait for it
(Thought this was vacation)
At some point, it'll come back
Just don't wait for it
(I won't keep you waiting)

[Outro: Jeremy Zucker]
Won't keep you waiting no more
(What're you doing?)
You're thinking too much, baby


[Verse 1]
Lights dim
Somewhere in the east of the city
These thoughts swim between
Reality and a dream
I just wanna be alone for a minute
I'm just thinking about how I ain't been home for a minute
Thinking like oh my God, this life
She wants more of mine
Uh, I guess you weren't ready for me
I heard most of my past have gone quiet on me
See, drinks with you, became drinks over you
But I think I'm going sober man that shit's over due
Truth is
All my brothers with me are some of the realest
Fearless clearest minded souls ever untold
You must have been mistaken
Don't get it fucked up
Can't afford to get it fucked up right now
Black and white lenses distort the perspective
Promised my mum I'd be back before the end of this sentence

[Chorus]
And we're alright with the darker side
It's inevitable, waiting for a dream
And we're alright with the darker side
It's inevitable, waiting for a dream

[Verse 2]
I tell my story
How dare you tell it for me
I walked into your world, you watched me leave through the other side
She was wishing for more, Channel & Dior
While I was washing my sins in some Dom Perignon
This vertigo got my back up against the views
That I grew in a darkroom
I told you I'd be back before the sun sets
Breaking bread with my flat mates
I'm grounded now I'm over that
Yeah, and now she wants me back
I guess that's only right
She only wants a home at the highest heights
3 and a half thousand miles of perspective
But still couldn't outrun the stars grip of the pencil
I can help you to overcome all your fears
Let them water fall like your tears
Overcome your nightmares for a dream
They say there's no life in the comfort zone
And no life where the cameras go
So where were you when I was coming up
I took my time and in time I trust
If beauty is pain, art is risk, what does that make love
Treading a fine line on my way to God
The path feels straight vertical
Follow the skyscrapers to the place that we've been dreaming of
I promise I won't let you fall this time
Finally satisfied with everything I've left behind

[Chorus]
And we're alright with the darker side
It's inevitable, waiting for a dream
And I'm falling, falling, falling
Will you be there when I can see

[Extra Notes]
I've been rethinking Paris
Everything that happened
I feel apprehensive
Too reach out
And send my blessings
Forget about mishaps
Life's too short
To back track
Looked in your eyes
A hand shake
Over prides back

I've been working hard
In and out of uni
Life's a movie
I just keep it under wraps
And let the music speak for me

This is a part of me
I never started I'll l never finish
Probably die
Half way through a lyric

We're all good till our dreams outgrow our friendship
You didn't share my vision
Its fruition blew your mind
Things change over time
I learnt to embrace that
I can't persuade you to be the friend that you were way back
Your mother had my photo on her fridge
All the years we've missed
I just text you what's been good
Tryna build a bridge
But you ain't tryna cross
Already crossed me off

When they love you for the cold days
I'm still here like always
So caught up in the life style
Reminiscing on the old days

We got it like that
We

Do you love me do you trust me
Told me you don't really know home
Said it ain't the same if I ain't there
My room

[Chorus]
Tide rushing in to me, two me ('Til)
'Til I can breathe easy on my knees ('Til)
Comes falling sins, I've been, been, I been ('Til)
Living easy on my knees, on my-

[Verse]
Concaving in the back
Days slipping through the cracks
Call for you in the back, I'll become stoic if I have to
Royce Rollin' in the back
No phone is now a lux
Heartbreaking in the past on me
On me, on me (Me)

[Bridge]
The still life projections of you (You)
Diffracting through my skull 'til ('Til)

[Chorus]
Tide rushing in to me, two me ('Til)
'Til I can breathe easy on my knees ('Til)
Comes falling sense, I've been, been, I been ('Til)
Living easy on my knees ('Til)

[Outro]
Breathe easy on me, yeah ('Til)
Sleep easy on me, on my-


Young man
Look what you've done
Such a horrible place
All in the name of love

You've been hiding away from us
Caught and choked in the fall, mmm

Young man
Look what you've done
Let it all be for shame
Threw the love away, for what

Many chances came at once
Sold them all for your soul, mmm

I know that I fucked it up
I know I let you down
How can I make it up
To you is it too late now

Too late now, too late now

Old man
Oh, its been rough
These gifts were never wasted
Words kill hesitation once

I rely on the faith too much
Please don't waste your love, please don't waste your love

I know that I fucked it up
I know that I let you down
How can I make it up
To you is it too late now

I know that I fucked it up
I know that I let you down
How can I make it up
To you is it too late now

Too late now, too late now

[Intro]
That's better

[Verse 1]
Heart beat, blunt feel, can't sleep
Cold, but it's still burning
Your precious time wasting, on me

[Pre-Chorus]
So why you gotta drag me?
I've been in a hole since like last week
And I'm holding on, I've held on
I'm holed up

[Chorus]
'Cause you love in
You love in, streams
Seasonal life bringer
'Cause you love in
Yeah, you love in, streams
But I can't keep swimming uphill, woah

[Verse 2]
Wonder how we'll call it in the light
Saharan heat had me driving in the sky
Throwing stones 'cause you're getting bored
Kids in glass houses don't wear a lot of clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, so why you gotta drag me?
I've been in a hole since like last week
And I'm holding up, I've held on
I'm holding on

[Chorus]
'Cause you love in
And you love in, streams, streams
'Cause you love in, you love in, streams
But I can't keep swimming uphill
'Cause you love in, you love in, streams
Oh, the only way is up from here

[Verse 3]
Heart beats drowned out
Let me go now (to the haters?)
Blunt feel trauma (-to the youth)
Sleepless cycle (to the youth!)
Precess further

[Outro]
Do something, anything
Do whatever, you know?
Start a milk factory, go make uh, magazine, uh, get a job
Draw a painting, do anything, you know?
Have fun, stay safe
Safe sex, safe drugs
And, uh, have fun, that's it

[Intro]
Fucking hell, man
(Okay, ready now?)
(Yes)

[Verse 1]
I couldn't wait to leave that town
It broke my heart
I had to go (Shit)
I made a choice
To see this out I lost it all
You didn't show

[Pre-Chorus]
All you wanted was some violent form of love
Immolate me (Oh Lord)
All I was looking for was colours blurred
And words that I'd forget
And now I'm singing

[Chorus]
"Slow down
Keep those feet on the ground
I hope you'll be home soon"
Somehow we'll figure out how to cope
This is nothing we can't
There is nothing we can't do, right

[Verse 2]
You lost your voice, you couldn't sing
You couldn't talk about it
I stood and watched
The summer shone, rain down our backs
We didn't care
It was enough

[Pre-Chorus]
All you wanted was some violent form of love (Love!)
Immolate me, woah (Violence, violent)
All I was looking for was colours blurred
And nights that I'd forget
And now I'm singing

[Chorus]
"Slow down
Keep your feet on the ground
I hope I'll be home soon"
Somehow we figured out how to cope
This is nothing we can't
There is nothing we can't do
Right?

[Outro: Children singing an interpolation of Linstead Market]
Oh Lord
What a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
Lord what a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
Everybody come feel up, feel up
What their muma no bring
Everybody come feel up, feel up
What their muma no bring

Oh Lord
What a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
Lord what a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
(Aww)

[Verse 1]
Vacuum stuck to my head
Sucking out my
Vital thoughts
Where did I go wrong?
I know better
Than to wander
Far out of my mind
I'm out of my own mind
Again

[Verse 2]
Stomping out the
Ashes burning
Color in the flame
Destroying my escape
Slowly turning
Asking questions
When did we go wrong?
Why am I alone
Again?

[Refrain]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 3]
When the light hits your face
And you can't catch a break
And your love is your fate
You might not make it
If you wait for the day
The wrong day just might take you
Away to a place where you're too afraid
Don't let the scaries
Corrupt your story
I know it's crazy
It's almost amazing

[Refrain]
Ooh ooh

[Verse 4]
Catch my breath as
I lose focus
Leave the rest behind
There's nothing left to hide
New perspective
Got me thinking
I will be alright
Everyone loses
Their mind

[Refrain]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Intro: Brede Baldwin & EDEN]
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)

[Verse 1: Brede Baldwin]
Call to the world
Whispering through the valleys
That run through our blood and bones
Breaking the constant cycle

[Chorus: Brede Baldwin]
Deciding to live, free at last
Fight through the past, now it's finally time
We have the choice
You have the voice that will live through our sons
And move generations to come

[Bridge: Brede Baldwin]
So just try
Just hold tight
We found light
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Deciding to live
(We)
(To fight)

[Verse 2: EDEN]
Run from all you know
The concrete makes way to valleys
And all of our lessons learned
Will carry us through the unknown

[Chorus: EDEN]
Deciding to live, free at last
Fight through the past, now it's finally time
We have the choice
You have the voice that will live through our sons
And move generations to come

To come
To come
To come

[Outro: Brede Baldwin & EDEN]
So just try
Just hold tight
We found light
It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
Alright


Alright, let's start with the word "start," alright?
One, two, three
"Start!"
That's pretty sick though, alright
Alright, next one, next one
Okay, this-
Now is the word "end" alright?
So one, two, three
"End!"
Sick, alright, what else we got?
Okay, "love"
One, two, three
"Love!"
"Not," one, two, three
"Not!"
No, not that
Two more words to go guys, alright?
Next word is "wrong," so one, two, three
"Wrong!"
Hell yeah
And last one is "brave"
So, one, two, three
"Brave!"
Thank you so much guys
Who knows? Hopefully that worked and you'll end up on a song


[Verse 1]
'Cause we've been driving so long
I can't remember how we got here
Or how we survived so long
Trying to run from our pride
'Till you set fire to my atmosphere
And I remember how I spent the twenty-third
Feeling six feet under
When I'm thirty-thousand feet in the air
Chasing that sundown
So far east I'm westbound
Feeling like the edge of this world is near

[Pre-Chorus]
But you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to god I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back someday
This is more than just a phase, love
Shooting stars all break up
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things will be better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say

[Chorus]
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them
And they mean nothing to me?
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million, anyway?

[Verse 2]
'Cause you see only what you want to
Your tunnel vision owns you
And you can't see what's wrong
When you keep sleeping through the PM
Eyes wide open when you're dreaming
You're sleepwalking, just keep talking
Maybe you can talk your way out of this deep end
No B-plan in your system
Just tell me what you're thinking
I'm scared that you might fall
But you're not
But you're not

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Taking off your makeup
Sun always seems to wash our fears away
And it's always shining somewhere
I just gotta get there
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things are better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say

[Chorus]
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them
And they mean nothing to me?
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million?

[Bridge]
You're so much better than that
You're so much better than that
You're so much better than that
Stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million anyway?

[Outro]
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to God, I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say:
"You're so much better than that"




Are you bringing me in?
Are you taking me out?
Are you bringing me in?
Are you taking me out?

The scales will fall from my eyes
Reload me with one surprise
Destroy my dirt and burn me clean
Save me
Save me be my sweet gasoline

Reload me with one surprise
The scales will fall from eyes
With your blunted knives
Numbed out bliss never lies

Hunger soon tames your tongue
You'll thank me when I'm done
When I am done
The scales will fall from my eyes
You'll thank me when I am done

Are you taking me out?

When I am done
The scales will fall from my eyes
Are you bringing me in?
Are you taking me out?
Are you bringing me in?
Are you taking me out?

You'll thank me when I am done
When I am done
You'll thank me

I'm tryin' not to doubt, oh
I'm just tired of being down
Try and knock you down, oh
Just tryin' not to-
Yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse]
I'm tryin' not to doubt, oh
I'm just tired of being down
Try and knock you down, oh
Just tryin' not to-
Yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse]
I'm tryin' not to doubt, oh
I'm just tired of being down
Try and knock you down, oh
Just tryin' not to-
Yeah

[Chorus & Saxophone Solo]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Last night was a car crash
Highlights meet a quick end
Live the high life 'fore the weekends
Coming down hard to the sunset sinking in
Didn't try hard for a diehard
Nothing I can say that you won't get wrong
And everybody asks where you're gone now
Can you only really want what you don't have enough?
Everything you ever wanted adding up
To be the reason you can't stand it now
You talk a lot, well act like it
Finally found a way to get myself untangled
And undone, but it's alright
This ain't been the dream in a long time
Make sure you play the music when my time's up
Oh, just say it, I'm done

[Chorus]
So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?
'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most
But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world
Some say these things are for the best
How are you so sure?

[Verse 2]
And you can find me where the sea pours into the stars
I'll get there someday
I hope you find everything you think that you want
Bruises will fade
Time on our side, we can wait for it
I'll be doing fine, if you are
'Cause life is but a dream
Only as real as you let it be

[Chorus]
So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?
'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most
But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world
Some say these things are for the best
For better or worse

[Verse 1: EDEN]
Life goes on
The world turns without me
(Without me)

[Verse 2: Telepathics]
Life goes on
The light ends the dark
Mistakes made forgot
Through years and gods
Forever we are
Infinite


[Verse 1]
I used to wonder how it'd feel like
I looked to everyone for answers
Chasing round and down in circles, on purpose
In search of something
I spent a while trying to learn somehow
Some missing pieces will not stop me
I tried to fill my gaps with heartbeats, so fleeting, but cold feet
I'm sorry

[Chorus]
And I still don't know how I feel about it
And I still don't know but I feel like I'm learning
How to clear my head when all I think about is you
But I'm only human
I found out, I know now

[Verse 2]
I still wonder how I'd have turned out
If I'd done everything I wanted
If I'd lived like I feel like I could've, or should've
When I was younger
But I'm good now, I found out

[Chorus]
That I still don't know how I feel about it
And I still don't know but I feel like I'm learning
How to catch my breath when all I'm breathing for is you


[Verse 3]
I can't keep holding it down
But you keep showing me how
If you're only human
Oh, I think I found out, woah
I think I know now

[Outro]
I used to wonder what love is
But ever since you've been around
I finally think I have it figured out
What I missed then, but see now
I found out, I know now

[Verse]
But I could be more
Isn't there more?
Don't you dream of forgetting this?
Have we forgotten what we want?
Counting the wars and broken bones
Haven't we lost enough already?
Isn't this more than what it's worth?
Have we forgotten where we came from?
Long way from laying in the dirt
And if I can only dream of up from down there
God, help me, I'll be gone
Have I lost sight of everything I've worked for?
Did I get this all wrong?


[Intro]
1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she's in love with the concept
As if we're all just how she imagined
'Cause we're in love, I just don't know it yet, huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I don't believe in it no more
But I won't tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It's easier if she thinks she won
So I'ma let her, and she said

[Chorus 1]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
Girl, I don't think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No I don't love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks
But just know
I'm not singing for your XO
I'm just singing 'cause it's over
Yeah, uh, yeah


[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Came and went like the summer time
Was that a sunset or sunrise?
Looking back like, "Where'd the time go?"
So much for trying to keep this moving slow

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I don't believe in her no more
But I remember
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
I still remember what she said

[Chorus 2]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
But I don't think she knew me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I'm no liar, and I never hid anything
You should've seen it coming to this
Just know
I'm not singing for an ex, though
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah, yeah

[Drop]


[Outro]
Uh, girl I'm just singing
I'm just singing, yeah
I'm just singing 'cause it's over

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she's in love with the concept
As if we're all just how she imagined
'Cause we're in love but just don't know it yet, huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?
'Cause I don't believe in it no more
But I won't tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It's easier if she thinks she won
So I'ma let her, and she said

[Chorus]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
Girl I don't think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No I don't love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks
But just know
I'm not singing for your XO
I'm just singing 'cause it's over

[Verse 2]
Came and went like the summertime
Was that a sunset or a sunrise?
Looking back like where'd the time go?
So much for trying to keep this moving slow
'Cause I don't believe in her no more
But I remember


[Bridge]
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
And I still remember what she said

[Chorus]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
But I don't think she knew me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I'm no liar, and I never hid
Anything, you should have seen it coming to this
Just know
I'm not singing for an ex though
I'm just singing 'cause it's over
Girl I'm just singing
Just singing yeah
I'm just singing 'cause it's over

[Verse 3]
'Cause I've been trying to find another way
And I've been trying to get my story straight
Oh I've been saying if I ever change
Then it's going slow cause I've got me and all these ghosts I won't let go of
Oh yeah, you got way too many questions
'Bout the way of my decision
Got us stuck in this position
'Bout to break me down
And she can't hate me like I hate myself
And my skills
I'm lying for the thrill
I might just be destined, can't love
But that's just how I feel
I need to see your world to know it's real
Yeah
Oh and that's just how I feel
I feel
That's just how I feel
Oh yeah
And she said no I don't think I love you no more
That's just how I feel



[Intro: ATO]
I told her welcome to my place
Where the niggas roll and the girls won't stay away
Yeah

[Verse 1: ATO]
I told her welcome to my place (oh yeah)
Where the niggas roll and the girls won't stay away (okay)
And in London, yeah, on the west side that's where I stay
God chose me and I ain't even finished with it
God chose me I hope that they all with us
Oh yeah
Maybe we can show them somethin'
Show them somethin' out of nothin', bro
'Cause when I'm on my own
I know you on your own
You thinkin' 'bout your death
You thinkin' 'bout your stone
And you rappin' for your mum
You know we share some mums 'cause that's family
OMWMB
That shit gave me gravity for real
Fuck signing on a deal
If they ain't taking all of us, they can't take in none of us
On some James Brown again
Looking up and looking down
For those niggas in the sky and those niggas on the ground
I stay real for them forever 'til whenever the forever is
And I pray they never forget why the fuck I'm doin' this
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: ATO]
'Cause I been rolling with the conquerors tonight
That's my team, we up and comin' girl tonight
And if they didn't know, they know it now
Listen girl, 'cause you'll be missing out

[Chorus: ATO]
You know
I'm not tryna' be different like you know
I'm just puttin' it down, lettin' you know
I've got a few ex-bitches that you know
If I want you in, I'll let you know
I've got more goals than you know
Got more goals than Ronaldo
And let it sit in some of that cologne, yeah

For sale
My team that ain't for sale
My girl that ain't for sale
My soul that ain't for sale
Won't sell out, nah
For sale
My flow that ain't for sale
My business ain't for sale
My future ain't for sale
Won't do it ever

[Verse 2: ATO]
Look, we both have a history but that might affect our future
So at present keep that as a mystery, 'cause I don't plan to do what I used to
Dark nights in a dark room with nobody
Just me
Me myself and I in conflict
But to you it just looks like me huh
But that's normal right
Kickin' and screamin' through the night
Party 'til tomorrow is born in an English storm and today so quietly die as I feel like
They ain't got nothing on me
They ain't got nothing like this, nah
Feel like I'm running the team
Got Rag- on Rag- on Ragstar
If they ain't feeling will they know my name
If they ain't feeling then I'll feel the same
I'm real as ever, I'll never change
Disturb the water and watch the waves
Last year was feeling like it's never gonna pop
Spending time by the sea throwing rocks but I never wrap it up
That's not me
If there was a news car, probably be writing to the bounce of my heartbeat
This young fucker's got what money can't buy
Real girls love makes a rich man see
That the grass might be a little greener on the other side
So tell me what you know what you know
Tell me where you been where you been on the low
Uh, tell 'em
We're the conquerors, you know this

[Pre-Chorus: ATO]
'Cause I been rollin' with the conquerors tonight
That's my team, we up and comin' girl tonight
And if they didn't know, they know it now
Listen girl, 'cause you'll be missin' out

[Chorus: ATO]
You know
I'm not tryna' be different like you know
I'm just putting it down, letting you know
I've got a few ex-bitches that you know
If I want you in, I'll let you know
I've got more goals than you know
Got more goals than Ronaldo
And let it sit in some of that cologne, yeah

For sale
My team that ain't for sale
My girl that ain't for sale
My soul that ain't for sale
Won't sell out, nah
For sale
My flow that ain't for sale
My business ain't for sale
My future ain't for sale
Won't do whatever

[Bridge: EDEN]
She told me, "Baby, it was just one
It was just one night"
She told me, "Baby, it was just one
It was only one night"
She told me, "Baby, it was just one
It was just one"
She told me, "Baby, it was just one"
And I said, "You were just another"

[Chorus: ATO]
You know
I'm not tryna' be different like you know
I'm just puttin' it down, lettin' you know
I've got a few ex-bitches that you know
If I want you in, I'll let you know
I've got more goals than you know
Got more goals than Ronaldo
And let it sit in some of that cologne, yeah

For sale
My team that ain't for sale
My girl that ain't for sale
My soul that ain't for sale
Won't sell out nah
For sale
My flow that ain't for sale
My business that ain't for sale
My future that ain't for sale
Won't do whatever

That's kinda fucked up


[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yea, I- I like it when you just, listen more, like, I just wanna, let go)
Today I'm listening to Macy Gray
And Billie Holiday
Miles Davis and John Coltrane
Tryna reminisce on the days I would take a train to my father's place
A few panic attacks away
Life is a circle and I used to run it
Been round it enough, to light it then smoke it up
Got me coughing 'cause I don't do this shit a lot
These clothes are old but my trainers the latest drop
Schmitt, Lenin on my bedside and Malcolm X
Ewan just sent me The Alchemist, that's next
My girl's here quite often these days
That's a new picture for a frame, while the frame gets bigger then smaller
That's my little brother in the corner
He don't look like me but he's like me
Says a lot about the world if you ask me
I'd give him the world if he asked me
In this black and white work, he doesn't read into colours
In his colouring book they all complement each other
I learn more from him than from anyone else
Not to question the world but let it question me
We should all try and listen to the simplest minds
For more times they see more than we do
Blinded by the lies that are designed to deceive you
I want to meditate and reason with evil
Heard you're forcing a reason for why we're not talking
But that's not the truth
Some things are better let go and better unsaid
I'll shake your hand and wish you the best
I'm waking up to a sunset
And fall asleep to a drunk text
"I'm proud of you" is what my Mum said
"I love you" is what my Dad said
Yo, those are the words I need
They feel like a breeze
They let your Son breathe


[Chorus]
Yeah
Feel the gas from the stove
Hear the cars fill the roads
Finally alone
Step out of your clone
Throw it in the washing machine and watch it go
It'll be dry by tomorrow my bro
An old space
My suitcase in the middle
These four walls tell you how well they listen
Window that talked to me and taught me things
It ain't much but it's everything

[Verse 2]
There's an art to honesty
Let truth slide off either side before it gets on top of me
Truth is, all of this shit's beyond my control
Until I start giving it thought and let it go
Men have tried to pierce this question we're in
Only sadness has shown 'em where a next world begins
So I stop asking questions and let life ask 'em
Fall back as these walls begin to darken
Good morning
It's beautiful this morning
Sun shines through the window I left open
Travels up these walls that got to know me
I'll answer all the questions that you show me
I leant on you
'Til you were bruised too
That's why I shoulda never let those other walls go
Leant on you
'Til you shrugged me off
It's why I shoulda never let those other walls go
I grew up so well with my Mother
I woulda never had it any other
I'm still laid here reminiscing
Me holding your forced hand that forced all the difference
I miss your cooking
I miss just chillin'
Talk feelings
In our house we had no ceilings
Just gimme the time and the place
And we'll recreate it
Today we got to talking 'bout philosophy
And the human passion for action
The desire to take one step forwards
Despite inevitably taking two steps backwards
We're too deep, to know which way the waves go
As your words ring around my head like a halo
Pull up to the station
Asking when you'll see me again
And I said "You'll always be my best friend"


[Chorus]
Feel the gas from the stove
Hear the cars fill the roads
Finally alone
Step out of your clone
Throw it in the washing machine and let it go
It'll be dry in an hour or so
A new space
My suitcase in the middle
These four walls, wonder how well they'll listen
Window that'll talk to me and teach me things
It ain't much but it's everything
Amen

[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22, 22

[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh
(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright (Ooh) if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
22 (I don't know about you)
22, 22

[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if (Ooh) you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22 (Whoa, oh)
22 (Dancing like)
22 (Yeah, yeah), 22, (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

[Verse 1]
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Intro]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren't nothing about you that don't do something for me

[Verse 1]
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren't nothing about you (there aren't nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

Whoa

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you got to do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything
[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren't nothing about you (there aren't nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren't nothing about you (there aren't nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

[Chorus - Modified]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
[Outro]
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There aren't nothing about you that don't do something for meI want to thank the fans for the last 10 years, and the recording academy for giving us this unbelievable honor. I want to thank all of the collaborators that you see on this stage. Mostly, I want to thank my co-executive producer Max Martin, who has deserved to be up here for 25 years. And as the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammy's twice, I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame. But if you just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you're going, you will know it was you and the people who love you who put you there,  and that will be the greatest feeling in the world. Thank you for this moment.

[Chorus 1]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Faster than my bullet

[Verse 1 - Zac Efron]
Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend

But it's not cause we're just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
Cause this song is all about Ellen

[Chorus 2]
Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen
Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

[Verse 2 - Taylor Swift]
I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could've died

She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets five million hits on YouTube

[Chorus 2]
Cause, Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

[Verse 1]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now
Yeah I slept, in my makeup again
Tell myself 'I must be crazy'
Thinkin' 'bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you

[Chorus]
I'd be a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Verse 2]
I go to work
Work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
Walk to the car, dig out my keys
Start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Bridge]
There you are
On the street
Just standing there, waiting on me
I show you, my new shoes
You say you love them
'Nd baby without you -

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

[Outro]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now

[Lyrics from Taylor's Inner Circle]
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine

[Intro]
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

[Verse 1]
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

[Chorus]
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!) Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was stay

[Verse 2]
Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

[Chorus]
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!) Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay! stay! stay! stay! stay!)

[Bridge]
Let me remind you
This was what you wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was

[Chorus]
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!) Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!) Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
(All you had to do was stay)
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!) (Oh)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!) (Ooh)
All you had to do was (Stay!)

[The Man]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man, I'd be the man yeah
Cause I'd be the man, I'd be the man

[Love Story]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"

[I Knew You Were Trouble]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(Knew it right there, knew it right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Blank Space]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Shake It Off]
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mm, mm
That's what people say, mm, mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mm, mm
That's what people say, mm, mm

But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I Shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I Shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down
To this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, "Oh my God," but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Why don't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
(Haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I Shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I Shake it off, I shake it off

I Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Lover]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be over dramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 1]
American boy, living life as it goes
Sitting on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

[Verse 2]
Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an American beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

[Verse 3]
American boy, raising little babies
Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
That's grown up, American boy

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

[Verse 1]
Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was going to keep

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

[Verse 2]
Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

[Outro]
Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder how it's going to feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

[Chorus]
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

[Verse 2]
I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I want to find
A love that's going to last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

[Chorus]
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for loveThere's a monster in my closet and I don't know what to do!
Have you ever seen him?
Has he ever pounced on you?
I wonder what he looks like!
Is he purple with red eyes?
I wonder what he likes to eat.
What about his size!!
Tonight I'm gonna catch him!
I'll set a real big trap!
Then I'll train him really well.
He'll answer when I clap!

When I looked up in that closet, there was nothing there but stuff.
I know that monster's in there!
I heard him huff and puff!
Could it be he wants to eat me?
Maybe I'm his favorite tray.
And if he comes to get me,
I'll scream loudly, "Go away!!"
If he's nice, I'll name him "Happy."
If he's bad I'll name him "Grouch."
I suspect that he is leaving, but if not. . .I'll kick him out!

[Verse 1]
Angelina's got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I've never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I don't cause

[Chorus]
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say
I wasn't brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
He's got everything you'd wanna be
He's funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won't cause

[Chorus]
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say
I wasn't brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But ain't it funny how
It all comes out
Isn't life sweet?

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say

[Chorus]
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say
I wasn't brought up that way

[Verse 1]
Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
So take it easy
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Neon Trees!

[Verse 2]
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

[Bridge]
Hush, hush the world is quiet
Hush, hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Well, I won't sleep tonight

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

[Verse]
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

[Bridge]
It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

[Chorus]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break? Why would you wanna break it?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Outro]
Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh I'm just a girl

[Spoken Intro]
So, we're gonna have the band take a little tiny break and I'm gonna play you a song that, uh, I wrote this when I was like thirteen years old and just moved to Nashville, and I knew that I wanted to end up making music and on a record label, but I didn't know how I was going to get there. And I wrote this song about it

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
I'm feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
'Cause I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"
(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

[Verse 1]
Salt air and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Oh, whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
(Ahh-ahh)

[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
'Cause I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
You were never mine

[Outro]
You were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"

[Spoken]
Haha, I loved that

[Verse 1: Sugarland]
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

[Pre-Chorus: Sugarland]
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said "No one else," how could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you "babe"

[Verse 2: Sugarland]
What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Sugarland]
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
We said, "No one else", how could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time

[Bridge: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
Since you admitted it (oh), I keep picturin' (oh)
Her lips on your neck (oh), I can't unsee it (oh)
I hate that because of you (oh), I can't love you, babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe?
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe

[Outro: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said "No one else," we ain't gettin' through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
This is the last time
You said "No one else"
This is the last time I'll ever call you "babe"

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Oh whoa
Oh whoa
Oh whoa

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Said "There's another," and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Taylor Swift]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift + Justin Bieber]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around, and I'm like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
[?]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Taylor Swift]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Outro: Justin Bieber + Taylor Swift]
I'm gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, I'm gone

[Verse 1]
I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever

[Chorus]
Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

[Verse 2]
I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you say
Do you say what you mean?
When you say our love could last forever

[Chorus]

Oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

[Chorus]
But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Now baby don't you break my heart
Slow



[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Outro]
All the time

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving

But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand...

And then he said, "It's too late to apologize"
It's too late...
He said, "It's too late to apologize"
It's too late...
So this is me swallowing my pride (It's too late to apologize)
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night (It's too late...)
And I go back to December (It's too late to apologize, it's too late)
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you (It's too late to apologize)
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine (It's too late...)
Oh...

He said you're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no, no, no...)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)

So take a look what you've done (Uh)
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (Uh), hey! (Hey!)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at (Uh)
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that? (Remember that?)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more, ah!

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood

And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey! (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off? (Uh-huh)
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done

You made a really deep cut

You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go

If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Uh, uh)
If you love like that, blood runs cold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]

All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way
Just don't

[Chorus: Should've Said No]
You should've said, "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Bad blood!)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge: Bad Blood]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes

[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy

[Post-Chorus]
(Bad decisions that we made)
I'm the bad guy
(Bad decisions that we made)

[Bridge]
I want your love, and your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught in a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught in a bad romance
I'm a bad guy
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy

[Post-Chorus]
(Bad decisions that we made)
I'm the bad guy
(Bad decisions that we made)
I'm the bad guy
(Bad decisions that we made)
I'm the bad guy
(Bad decisions that we made)

[Bridge]
I want your love, and your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You're the bad guy

[Verse 1]
You turn your dial to 93.7
Broadway acts like he's 11
Self-proclaimed
Say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan
I'm just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say

[Chorus]
You should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called "Tim McGraw"
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard

[Verse 2]
Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growing up not wearing any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day
Growing up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Because she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ

[Chorus]
So you should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called "Tim McGraw"
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on

[Verse 1]
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into mine
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why, I

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

[Verse 2]
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight 'cause I-I

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

[Outro]
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes
Beautiful eyes


[Verse 1]
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into mine
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why, I

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

[Verse 2]
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight 'cause I-I

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

[Chorus]
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

[Outro]
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes
Beautiful eyes


[Verse 1]
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Verse 2]
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Bridge]
And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts

[Verse]
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Bridge]
And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
The memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts

[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Verse 2]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Outro]
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Verse 1]
All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Verse 2]
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Bridge]
Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby

[Verse 1]
All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Verse 2]
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet
[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Bridge]
Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Verse 1]
Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight?
And ain't it sad
You can't forget about what we had?
Take a look at her and do you like what you see
Or do you wish it was me?

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Verse 2]
And does she know
Know about the times you used to hold me
Wrapped me in your arms and how you told me
I'd be the only one?
I heard about
Yeah, someone told me once when you were out
She went a little crazy, ran her mouth about me
Ain't jealousy funny?

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Verse 3]
Life with me was a fairytale love
I was head over heels 'til you threw away us
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Bridge]
I heard you're gonna get married, have a nice little family
Live out my dreams with someone new
But I've been told that a cheater is always a cheater
So I've got my pride and she's got you

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Outro]
Of your life, oh, oh yeah
You're gonna think of me
You're gonna think of me in your life
Oh, oh, yeah
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame

[Spoken Intro]
There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA, did you know that?
Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that I'm such a fan of and
I'd love to play you  some music I'm a fan of that's come from LA, is that okay?
This one came out in 1981: 8 years before I was born and I love this song, it's called "Bette Davis Eyes"

[Verse 1]
Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She's  got Bette Davis eyes

[Chorus 1]
And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

[Verse 2]
She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She's  got Bette Davis eyes


[Chorus 2]
She'll expose you
And just knows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush (ayy,ayy)
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

[Verse 1]
I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn't 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it's always on your terms
I'm hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You're talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I'd run
[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that
You can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
[Outro]
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
Better man

[Verse 1]
I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 2]
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 3]
You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Intro]
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Whoa, whoa-ah-oh

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!

[Outro]
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage

[Intro]
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

Let's hear the applause (come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah?)
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage

[Intro]
"Hey it's me, leave a message: make it hot"
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

[Verse 1]

She took him faster than you could say sabotage

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party

If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard

If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?

If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

[Intro: Kenny Chesney]
This song is about a girl who had a dream and followed it
And I know from living in this town for so many years
That there's a lot of girls out there in the audience tonight
With a lot of dreams in their head
And this song goes out to you, you alright? Here we go

[Verse 1: Kenny Chesney]
She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered someday
So she belted it, she hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them, as she brought them to their feet

[Chorus: Kenny Chesney]
She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small time town was hers
She was a

[Chorus: Kenny Chesney & Taylor Swift]
Big star at Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

[Bridge: Kenny Chesney]
She doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends put her down
The only thought she entertains
Is where they are and where she is now

Everybody

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
Her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're going
Unless you got something they ain't got

[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Chesney & Taylor Swift]
So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus
And the young girls scream out loud for Miss Taylor Swift
Man that could be us, she was a

[Chorus: Kenny Chesney & Taylor Swift]
Big star at Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

[Outro: Kenny Chesney & Taylor Swift]
Look who showed up
Happy birthday, Kenny Chesney
I love you, Nashville
We love you, thank you, Taylor

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I can show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, you want to play?
New money, suit & tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
So goddamn reckless, we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby, and I'll write your name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
I'm you're king and you're my queen
Find out what you want, be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keeping you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?", you get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
So goddamn reckless, we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby, and I'll write your name
I'll write your name
I'll write your name
I'll write your name

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 1 (Blank Space)]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Eh, eh

[Verse 2 (Blank Space)]
New money, suit and tie
I could read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
Dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3 (Blank Space)]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4 (Blank Space)]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she? "
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darlin', I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers

And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby...

[Verse 3 (Stand By Me)]
When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus (Stand By Me)]
So darlin', darlin'
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me
Stand by me

[Chorus (Blank Space)]
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Outro]
*Clapping and cheering*
Thank you

So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called "Blank Space," and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the "Oh!" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called "Blank Space."

"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Diamonds, seasides, all those things
[?] this song that [?]
Like, oh my God, listen in
Listen in, I do too
[?]
[?] honest [?]
We can all sing this and cry
[All you're?] thinking, all this time
[?]
Oh my God, listening
Just forget what you've heard about me
Don't believe what you hear about me, hear about me
'Cause it's gonna be forever, or gonna go -
Yeah! Hey, hey!
Gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over -
This is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track
Long list of ex-love -
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
*Click* I'll write your name
I've got a blank space, baby
*Click* I'll write your name"

That's awesome! I love it
Oh my god, everyone's gonna kill you
Yeah!

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Uhh
Ever thought about losing it
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
But you still can't find no food in it
That's foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is a uphill battle
But y'all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol' paddle
Why so shallow? I'm just askin'
What's the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like you're just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that've molded us
And if life hadn't chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y'all

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Intro - Becky G ]
Yo doc thank for sending me the instrumental, I owe you lunch

[Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 1 - Becky G]
Yeah, I know at moments life get overwhelming, no one helping
But I'll be there to be the air
You need when you breathe, I get scared too
But its my job as big sister
To never let the world creep up to get you
And never let no boy ever think to hit you
Forever smile when you pose for pictures
And everyday, look at your reflection
You so beautiful life's a blessing
And I know that I'm gone a lot
But I'm working till I'm on the top
And I'm gonna take you right there
I know sometimes, I don't fight fair
Don't you ever give into the hatred
Cause you and I too strong to break it
And I love how you wear my old shoes
And when you cry, then I'm there to hold you
And remember every line that I told you
Never let nobody think they own you
And one day you could run the world
Put a cape on, you're my wonder girl
And you always know what's up
Know that I'm gonna lift both us up
[Chorus - Becky G (Taylor Swift)]
Ah, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
Ah, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
When the world stars caving in
And you feel like that the end
Well you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both us up

(I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us)
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
When the world stars caving in
And you feel like that the end
Well you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both us up

[Post Chorus - Taylor Swift (Becky G)]
I wish (I wish) I was strong (one day) enough to lift not one (not one) but both of us (the both of us)

[Verse 2 - Becky G]
I know those bullies think they tough as ever no one better
Oh so clever, they won't get you
Cause I look at them like, so whatever
You the young man in this family
And I love it ever time that daddy
Looking at you like you're the truth
And we call you that cause you speak the truth
And you always keep us laughing
Wanna know it all, and you keep on asking
And I call you Chunky Monkey
I never let you fall Humpty Dumpty
No one look at the world like you do
Artistic I'm like, who knew?
I wish I was as smart as you is
Got the heart as the size of two kids
Alejandro, hope you knew this
Just be you, if the shoe fits
And you taught me to have some patience
Little brother you are the greatest
Don't you ever be afraid to fail
Just walk that road, I'll pay the will
And you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both us up
[Chorus - Becky G (Taylor Swift)]
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
When the world stars caving in
And you feel like that the end
Well you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both us up

(I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us)
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
Aw, know what's up, know that I'm gonna lift both us up
When the world stars caving in
And you feel like that the end
Well you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both us up

[Post Chorus - Taylor Swift (Becky G)]
Someday (yes), I will (I will) be strong enough (one day I'll be so strong, I'll lift the whole world up, say it with me) to lift not one but both of us

[Outro - Becky G]
And Frankie, you're the big brother of the family I want you to wear that Gomez name proud on the back of that jersey
One day, when the world starts caving in
Well you always know what's up
Just know that I'm gonna lift both of us up

[Verse 1]
Watch me go into the world today
Watch me try to blow the past away
Watch me laugh and watch me cry
Watch me fall and watch me fly
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I'm gonna fly

[Verse 2]
Watch me catch a star and pin it down
Watch me live another time around
Watch me doubt the things I love
Watch me find what I'm proud of
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I'm gonna fly

[Verse 3]
And I may break my wings
And fall flat on my shattered heart
And I may hit the ground
But I will never fall apart
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I'm gonna fly

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

[Bridge: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know

[Chorus]
That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

[Verse 2]
Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again
[Chorus]
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

[Bridge]
I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

[Chorus]
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

[Verse 1]
Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says "Please don't make me go back there again"
She said "I wish there was some way to make them stop it"
So he drives down to that principal's office and says

[Chorus]
"I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life to see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way"

[Verse 2]
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say
She said "He tried but there's just some things I won't do"
And through the tears she said "I couldn't do that to you"
And he said

[Chorus]
"I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life to see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way"

[Verse 3]
The phone rings on a rainy night, says "It's Officer Tate"
He said "Sir, there's been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily, she's fading fast"
He says "God, I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girl's smile
So please don't take that away, it won't be easy taking her today
She wasn't brought up that way"

[Outro]
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes

[Verse 1]
I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room, holding her hand
I'd have never guessed that starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

[Chorus]
And by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

[Verse 2]
I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing and come over here to say
I'm looking good

[Chorus]
But by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
[Outro]
By the way, you still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way, if you ever wondered
Still got the same old number, just in case
I still miss you and I still love you
By the way
By the way, oh

[Verse 1]
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Outro]
(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want... to

[Verse 1]
Any day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

[Verse 2]
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're going to be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

[Verse 3]
Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't going to take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

[Verse 4]
Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

[Outro]
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?[Verse 1]
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying

[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Verse 2]
We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time I don't know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear that whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know
That I'll be crying
[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Bridge]
(Even try) I'll always be here by your side
(Why, why, why) I never wanted to say goodbye
(Why even try) I'm always here if you change, change your mind

[Verse 3]
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
But that would be lying

[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobble stones
When you are young they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young they assume you know nothing

Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Somebody come take me home
I knew you, dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you, hand under my sweater, baby kiss it better
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favourite

It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you, ooh

Why is everything so confusing?
Am I out of my mind?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So first of all, I'm obsessed with, like, pretty much all of these tracks, and it was really hard to figure out like what I wanted to write first because I had thoughts for all of them, so, unbelievable archives, I can't believe you have this just, like, laying around, that's ... ridiculous, these are unbelievable. But anyway, the first one that I... I was working something up for is the "Maple" one? And I came up with this thing, and it's probably gonna obviously like be sequencing differences like, you know, different lengths and different verses and whatever, but this is just like a rough, uh, thing. 

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Living in a gold age
Sneaking to my bird cage, I
I knew you
Laughing like a damn fool
Breaking every damn rule, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Instrumental Break]
And then, I have like this-- there's like a break, because I don't really know what's gonna happen here, but I do have like a... I think it's here? Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing. 

[Bridge]
And to kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
Now I'm bleedin'
I'm bleedin'

[Instrumental Break]
We'll work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, there's all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait til then, and then, I start singing again. I don't think it's right now, but... there it is. The ending. 

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter leaving Wendy, I
I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
That when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a stolen kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
I knew I'd wish you would've changed your mind
I knew you'd miss me once the moment died
I knew to love would be to lose my mind

And then, I don't know. You let me know what you think. And, uh, that's just kind of like a rough idea of... something. Let me know if you like it. 

[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Perignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems[Verse 1]
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

[Chorus]
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, finding things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
[Bridge]
Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

[Chorus]
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 1]
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

[Chorus]
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, finding things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

[Chorus]
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah



I don't need a lot
But there is one thing
Love has taught me
It's to never expect too much
Don't need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you
And I might, I found life
Why should we be wasting time?

You don't know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view

Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summer's eve
No offense to them but they ain't got nothing on you
Walking with you
In the light or in the dark
Well nothing shadows who you are

And you don't know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view

I look outside the window
Everyday see something new
But all I ever wanted was a
Window looking at you, at you

And you don't know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
You don't know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view



[Verse 1]
Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't want to think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 2]
I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

[Chorus]
But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 3]
Merry Christmas, everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

[Outro]
You were mine

[Verse 1]
What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me, what would you find?

[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

[Verse 2]
What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?

[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
[Bridge]
We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

[Chorus]
Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

[Outro]
There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)
[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you[Spoken Intro]
It's jingleball, there's Santa hats everywhere, you're never too far away from one and you know I was wondering if maybe you wanted me to sing a song that I wrote?

[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]

Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow

And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)
[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing
[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

[Breakdown]
The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
(Oh)

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
[Outro]
(Oh, oh)
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'm finally clean[Verse 1: Clean]

The drought was the very worst
Oh-oh, oh-oh
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Clean]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus: Clean]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean

[Verse 1: Long Live]
I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
[Chorus: Long Live]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge: Long Live]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

[Transition: New Year's Day]

And hold on...
To spinning around...
Confetti...
Falls to the ground...

[Verse 1: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but
[Chorus: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2: New Year's Day]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
[Bridge: New Year's Day]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

[Transition: Long Live]
And Long live
(Please don't ever become a stranger)
The walls we crashed through
(Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
I had the time of my life
(Please don't ever become a stranger)
With you
(Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)

[Outro: Long Live]
And Long live
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

[Verse 1]
I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that's good enough for me
Don't need the real thing
That's just another thing
For me to try to tame
Don't know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

[Verse 2]
Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him
[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

[Bridge]
It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I'll never look
At a sunset the same night

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure

[Verse 2]
Don't treat me like
Some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears, and my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure
Your closure, your closure

[Bridge]
I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, closure, your closure
Your closure



[Verse 1]
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Verse 2]
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Bridge]
You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
(Died for you)

[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Verse 1]
You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

[Chorus]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Verse 2]
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

[Chorus 2]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Bridge]
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

[Chorus]
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

[Verse 1]
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

[Chorus]
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

[Verse 2]
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

[Chorus]
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

[Bridge]
I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

[Chorus]
But I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

[Outro]
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Matt Berninger]
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger, Both]
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

[Outro]
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]

Oh, never again

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you

[Outro]
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

[Verse 1]
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game"

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

[Chorus]
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

[Verse 3]
Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

[Chorus]
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
[Post-Chorus 1]
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me

[Post-Chorus 2]
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Chorus]
You're a cowboy like me

[Post-Chorus 1]
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
[Post-Chorus 2]
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Bridge]
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

[Verse 4]
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

[Chorus]
I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
[Outro]
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again[Verse 1]
I'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

[Verse 2]
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe
[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh

[Verse 3]
Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't want to hide anymore
Oh oh

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier[Verse 1]
I've been counting days and
I've been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to jinx my luck
I've left it all behind me
And I've been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreaming of you baby
I've been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
'Cause I've been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to jinx my luck
I've left it all behind me
And I've been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

[Bridge]
Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if you've seen one
I'd like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

[Chorus x2]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer[Verse 1]
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I-

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
[Verse 2]
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance?
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I-

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

[Chorus]
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)

[Verse 1]
He said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In the city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with"
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back

[Chorus]
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

[Verse 2]
He was lying when he said he moved to L.A
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just seven miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down, saying

[Chorus]
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

[Bridge]
She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

[Chorus]
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

[Outro]
In dark blue Tennessee

[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)
[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love

[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
So I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white
But it's golden golden
And I can still see it all in my head
Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, like daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Outro]
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I shoulda known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shoulda known
[Outro]
You shoulda known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda known[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed your rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away

Over your sad empty town, yeah-yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
[Outro]
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you shoulda' known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda' known[Intro]

My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?
[Chorus]
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"

[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
Yeah, I want you...

Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)

'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dark night on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Delicate

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, your mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)

Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Delicate

Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the  time

'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)

Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?

'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?

'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

She walks to school
With her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

[Chorus]
Didn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

[Verse 2]
He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
We're here to die for our God
He stood up and said that's funny
Cause my God died for me
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried
[Chorus]
And didn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray to oh

[Verse 3]
The taxis pulled up
On the very day of
They rode 100 floors up
Just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down

[Chorus]
And didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
Where were you
And didn't they pray to
Oh
[Outro]
I walk to school
And I wear a cross
I'm counting
Every day[Verse 1]
Inside my heart
We have a brand new start
But you wanna keep us apart
It's not fun being me
My secret's disappearing
You'll know what I'll be hearing
Everyone's inside my toybox
Everyone wants to stalk my little toybox
If you weren't born with it
You can buy a couple ornaments
Just be sure to read the warning, kids
'Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it, ha-ha
Sexual, hey girl, if you wanna feel sexual
You can always call up a professional
They stick pins in you like a vegetable, ha-ha
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah
Old suitcase, clean getaway
I'm the one who takes the blame again
New day but the same lines
I feel like a victim of the dollar sign
Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel
Step one
You must accept that I'm a little out my mind
Step two
This is a waste if you can't walk me down the finish line
Step three
Give me passion, don't make fun of my fashion
Step four
Give me more, give me more, more
If you can't handle a heart like mine
Don't waste your time with me
If you're not down to bleed, no, oh
If you can't handle the choking, the biting
The loving, the smothering
'Til you can't handle it no more, no more
Go home
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here

[Outro]
Please, please
Don't leave me
Be
It's not true
Take me to the rooftop
Told you not to worry
What do you want from me?
Don't ask questions
Wait a minute
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
Baby, I don't feel so good
And all the good girls go to Hell
Bite my tongue, bide my time
What is it about them?
I'm the bad guy[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin', pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh-whoah-oh-oh)
[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh-oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy (Oh-oh-oh)
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

[Outro]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
But something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you

For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right

I'll be using for the rest of my life
Just don't blame me, your love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide

And baby, for you, I would fall from grace

Oh!

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (Doesn't! Ain't doing it right!)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (Rest of my life...)
Just don't blame me, your love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (Doing it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

[Verse 1]
My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

[Chorus]
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

[Verse 2]
He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I want to do is say

[Chorus]
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

[Verse 3]
I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

[Chorus]
Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

[Outro]
I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye


[Verse 1]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way

[Chorus]
It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, you're a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything

[Verse 2]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show

[Chorus]
But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah
Ooh



[Verse 1]
Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could've been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

[Verse 2]
In through the window I see her with you
I'm soaked to the skin, you're warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

[Bridge]
All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling...

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could've been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

Down came the rain



[Verse 1]
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about-

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha...

[Post-Chorus]
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops...
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Outro]
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off



[Verse 1]
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, until the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
75 Johnson and an electric choke
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
I would make it whine
He'd say, "You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides"
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip, we'd haul trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

[Chorus]
It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower, girl
You're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
Soon I'll be grown up
With daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Steer it left, and turn it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
Oh, he let me drive
Oh, he let me drive

[Outro]
It's just an old plywood boat
With a 75 johnson
And electric choke

[Spoken Intro]
You know... You guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

[Verse 1]
Now that he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey

[Hook 1]
Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights are faded
And that heaven is overrated?

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that he's back from that soul vacation
Tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey
Now that he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Hook 2]
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along in the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?

And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?

Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Hook 3]
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while
You were looking for yourself?

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?

Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

[Breakdown]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Outro]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Oh, Taylor, I was so enchanted to meet you too

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

[Verse 2]
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wondered till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
It was enchanting to meet you
Oh, Taylor, I was so enchanted to meet you too
[Chorus]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

[Bridge]
This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you too
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too
[Outro]
I was never in love with someone else
I never had somebody waiting on me
Because you were all of my dreams come true
And I just wish you knew
Taylor, I was so in love with you

[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette

And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door

It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ahh
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1]
Now well when I was young, we connected
When we were a little bit older, both done
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me and rumours are knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
I made some mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm something was born on the Fourth of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, never say it
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't lose you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love, you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Walking on the beach with you right next to me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (wanna' be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ahh

It's like your eyes are bigger, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my own lips

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (me and you)
I wanna be your A-Team (be your A-Team now)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Verse 2]
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Bridge]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)
Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)

[Outro]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen



[Verse 1]
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Verse 2]
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Bridge]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Outro]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
Make sense of what you've seen

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind the tape, but all it does is pause
On the very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)

[Bridge 1: Justin Vernon]
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

[Bridge 2: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
(You good to go?)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift &  Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah

'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift, Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) So many times
So many times
I, I, oh

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 1]
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 2]
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just got to keep your eyes open
[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

[Bridge]
Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

[Outro]
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open[Chorus]

Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 1]
Isn't it funny how many times we can say
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page
And moved on
That's what we thought

But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

[Verse 2]
You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

[Bridge]
Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just, baby, get along with me

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah
[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town

We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love

The altar is your hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, mmm
[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Oh, mmm

[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Verse 2]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah



[Fearless]
There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

[Fearless]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why when with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
So baby drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Fearless]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

[I'm Yours]
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before."

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
[Outro]
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath, as you walk through the doorsTrying just like they say
Just taking the step
Love is a piece of cake
Or so I thought
Everyone whisper life is just a twister
Make it full of riddles
Step it like a paddle
Just to find u
But but I...
Somewhere someplace sometime
I will play the song walking down the road
Just to find u
But but
Someone told me let it be
Hold your key
Make your way to the  sea u r free
Coz..
Baby I'm done finding u..[Verse 1]
Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in, and erased it

[Pre-Chorus]
For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

[Verse 2]
Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind

[Pre-Chorus]
And just as I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly
[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

[Bridge]
I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity

Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of "let's run away" and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate

Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I've never met, people I've known, or those I wish I hadn't. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn't his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out

A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone's secrets written in the sky for all to behold

In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I've told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve

Now it's up to you to pass them down[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always

[Chorus]
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
[Pre-Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always

[Chorus]
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me

I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said "forever and always"

[Chorus]
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

Made you run and hide like a scared little boy

[Bridge]
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so, oh oh oh
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby, back up


[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

[Pre-Chorus]

[Outro]
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah

[Verse 1]
It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It would've been good for you to be there
And every time you always would
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time
And nothing seems to be a blur

[Chorus]
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you

[Verse 2]
Would've been cool to never fall down
But then I never would've seen
The power isn't with the picture perfect person
You told me better things to come from in between

[Chorus]
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one, saying one, saying one for you

[Bridge]
It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes

[Chorus - Shortened]
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you



[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', "Go, go, go!"
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We're both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Outro]
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

[Intro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

[Verse 1]
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
[Verse 2]
I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned
[Chorus]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Want to see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Outro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her

[Sorry Not Sorry: Amy]
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Yeah
Payback is a bad chick
And baby, I'm the baddest
You messin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this (Oh)
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but no

[Break Free: Katherine]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Scared to Be Lonely: Lisa]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely?
(Scared to be lonely?)

[Blank Space: Amy, Lauren]
Nice to meet ya, where ya been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sent
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my gosh, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Woah
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Dark Horse: Katherine, Lisa]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[We Found Love: Katherine]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[You Say: Lauren]
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, You say I am Yours

[You Say/Halo: Katherine, Lauren]
And I believe
I can see your halo
Oh, I believe
I can see your halo
What You say of me
I can see your halo
I believe

[Halo: Amy, Lisa]
I can see your halo
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
I can see your halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
See your halo, halo
Halo
Halo
Ooh

[Intro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Chorus]
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 1]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had never seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 2]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

[Refrain]
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be

[Outro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
Oh, you should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a girlfriend, she's older than us
She's in the club doing I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whiskey on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
Oh, you should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
Oh, you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room, the darkened room
If you've got a boyfriend, I'm jealous of him
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
Oh, you make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Alone, unless you wanna come along

[Chorus]
Oh, you're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face, oh
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Intro]
Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous

'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)

At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous

[Verse 1]
My name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kind of scared cause
I've never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
Cause I'm going to see my daddy tonight
And she says that

[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

[Verse 2]
My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
Doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year
[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

[Verse 3]
James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

[Verse 4]
And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do


[Verse 1: John Mayer]
I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 2: John Mayer]
I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 3: John Mayer]
Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you

[Backup Vocals: Taylor Swift]
I can't stop loving you

But I can't stop loving you with half of my
Half of my heart
Half of my heart

[Chorus 2: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Half of my heart's got a real cool imagination
Half of my heart's got you
Half of my heart's got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart won't do

[Outro: John Mayer ]
Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart

[Verse 1: Amy]
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Payback is a bad chick
And baby, I'm the baddest
You messin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but no

[Verse 2: Katherine]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Verse 3: Lisa]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely

[Verse 4: Amy]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?
[Verse 5: Lauren]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 6: Katherine]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse

[Verse 7: Lisa]
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 8: Katherine]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
[Verse 9: Lauren]
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, You say I am Yours

[Verse 10: Katherine & (Lauren)]
And I believe (I can see your halo)
Oh I believe (I can feel your halo)
What You say of me (I can see your halo)
I believe

[Verse 11: Amy]
I can see your halo
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

[Verse 12: Lisa]
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
Halo (halo) halo[Verse 1]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Bridge]
I know
I know
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it

[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
It's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-Whoa, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-whoa, holding my breath
Whoa Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You are all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Bridge]
I know
I know
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I Can't go back, I'm haunted
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh- woah  oh, oh)
[Outro]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it[Chorus]
There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it's like you cross it every time
When you can't stop thinking about her[Verse 1]
Here you come again
Just when I'd begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

[Verse 2]
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wondering' how I came to doubt you

[Chorus]
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses

[Verse 3]
Here you come again
Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses

[Verse 4]
Here you come again
Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
Here I go[Verse 1]
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Bridge]
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

[Chorus]
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
[Outro]
Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself

[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh, baby

[Chorus:Tim McGraw]
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift]
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
You're trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift]
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby

[Verse 1]
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 2]
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Bridge]
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

[Outro]
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Intro]
One, two, one

[Verse 1]
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 2]
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
[Bridge]
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars

You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

[Outro]
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do[Verse 1: Jack Ingram]
I've been following your ghost
Running circles 'round this house
Tripping over memories
Trying to figure things out
It's been a few years and I miss you still
Got your picture on the window sill
Been thinking of ways, I got days to fill
I don't think I ever will

[Chorus: Jack Ingram & Taylor Swift]
Hold on to things you can't explain
Hold on to dancing in the rain
Hold on to kisses on the lips
Savor every sweet moment, cause baby this is it
And hold on
Hold on

[Verse 2: Jack Ingram, Both]
I've been cleaning up this mess
Found a metal box with some black and white photographs
A little faded but baby you sure do look good in that old dress, oh yes
Didn't we wish we were superstars?
Sign our names in the dust on your family car
We'd be waving to the crowd
You be the diva
And I'll play guitar
[Chorus: Jack Ingram & Taylor Swift]
Hold on to things you wanna be
Hold on to friends and family
Hold on to burning summer sun
It makes a difference, every one
Hold on
Hold on

[Verse 3: Jack Ingram & Taylor Swift]
Thinking that we'd say the same
But we didn't know that the world would change
Yeah it just keeps on spinning
And we just keep on holding on

[Chorus: Jack Ingram & Taylor Swift]
Hold on to things you  can't explain
Hold on to dancing in the rain
Hold on to kisses on the lips
Savor every sweet moment, cause baby this is it
And hold on to things you wanna be
Hold on to friends and family
Hold on to burning summer sun
It makes a difference, every one
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Bridge]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

[Chorus]
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Outro]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you



[Verse 1]
I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say


[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!


[Verse 2]
Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Cause you make me feel like flying!


[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!

[Bridge]
Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is

[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!



[Verse 1]
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But, baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

[Chorus]
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

[Verse 2]
My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"
My heart is saying, "Don't let go
Hold on till the end"
And that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

[Chorus]
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you


[Verse 1]
Step one, you say, "We need to talk."
He walks, you say, "Sit down. It's just a talk."
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you
[Chorus]
And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
[Verse 2]
Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now, you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
And you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
That I don't want you to go, oh, oh
[Breakdown]
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah-yeah
And then you say

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever (I want you forever and ever)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (This is how it works)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Get the girl)
(That's how it works)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
That's how it works
That's how you got the girl[Verse 1]
I bet this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

[Verse 2]
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you
And risk another goodbye

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do
[Bridge]
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you're touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

[Outro]
I bet this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week

I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me

[Verse 1]
I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Verse 2]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad (Oh)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)
It just felt so good, good[Intro]
I never trust a narcissist

[Outro]
Oh, they say I did something bad
Why's it feel so good, good?
It just felt so good, good

[Verse 1]
I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
He'll never fall in love, he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

[Chorus]
And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie

[Verse 2]
He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine

[Chorus]
I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie

[Bridge]
He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you
He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is my God, he's beautiful
So I put on my makeup
And pray for a miracle

[Chorus]
Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
I'd lie



[Verse 1: ZAYN]
Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like it's no point hoping at all

[Pre-Chorus 1: ZAYN]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus: ZAYN]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life

[Pre-Chorus 2: Taylor Swift]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus: ZAYN & (Taylor Swift)]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, ZAYN & Both]
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?

[Chorus: ZAYN]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Outro: Taylor Swift & ZAYN]
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
Until you come back home

[Verse 1]
How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But then something happened one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Verse 2]
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show
[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed who you are, then one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Bridge]
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah

[Spoken Intro]
So the clip that you're about to hear
Is my preparation for a writing session
Um I was writing with two writers
I hadn't ever worked with before
So I wanted to come in with an idea
That was pretty much all there
Melody and lyrics

Um, and so I had this idea
Called "I Forgot That You Existed"
And I wanted it to be really simple
I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album
Like basically kind of shrugging off
A lot of things
That you've been through that have
Been causing a lot of struggle and pain
And just one day you wake up and
You realize you're indifferent
To... whatever caused you that pain
And so this is a clip of me
Just trying to tinker around on the piano
Trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it
And you can hear the end result on the album
But this is where it started

[Sung]
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice

I forgot that you existed
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice

I forgot that you existed
I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and

How many nights I ... how you did me
How many days did I wait thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?

(humming)

I forgot that you existed
I thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet

I forgot that you existed

[Verse 1]
Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you"
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Bridge]
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door

[Chorus - Variation]
And I say, "Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out"
But I take it all back now

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Outro]
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you want to see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now
Thought you'd be here by now



If you're anything like me,
You bite your nails,
And laugh when you're nervous.
You promise people the world,
because that's what they want from you.
You like giving them what they want...
But darling, you need to stop,

If you're anything like me,
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
You cross your fingers, hold your breath,
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...
If life gets too good now,
Darling, it scares you.

If you're anything like me,
You never wanted to lock your door,
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore
For fear she was much better before...
But Darling, now you have to.

If you're anything like me,
There's a justice system in your head
For names you'll never speak again,
And you make your ruthless rulings.
Each new enemy turns to steel
They become the bars that confine you,
In your own little golden prison cell...
But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.

If you're anything like me
You've grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
But Darling, you keep trying.

If you're anything like me,
You couldn't recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...
Darling, later on you will thank your stars
for that frightful day.

If you're anything like me,
I'm sorry.

But Darling, it's going to be okay.



[Verse 1]
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I've created
I came out alive but I'm black and blue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Before you ask me if I'm alright
Think about what I
Had to do, yeah

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
I've got an "I heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand

[Verse 2]
I'd be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home and cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
I've got an "I heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand

[Bridge]
And when you're home alone at night
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh baby
I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know
Someday you will

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we won't make up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I've got an "I heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand

[Outro]
Written on the back of my hand
An "I heart question mark," yeah
Written on the back of my hand

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care and i guess i liked that
And when i fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And i realize the blame is on me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down
Oh, i knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be
And now i see, now i see, now i see
He was long gone when he met me
And i realize the joke is on me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been

So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been

Now I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see

She was long gone when she met me
And I realize the joke is on me
Yeah

Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble

And the saddest fear, comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or him, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

[Chorus]
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down

[Outro]



I think... I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes, you know? It's like a kaleidoscope of memories, it just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, it was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again, but I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him, it was losing me.



[Intro]
[Recorder click]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I (I, I, I, I)

[Verse 1]
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Verse 2]
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Bridge]
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Outro]
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)
And you know for me, it's always you (I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
And I know for you, it's always me (I know places)
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I

So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together

I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said "I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else". So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called "I Know Places". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song

"Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:

Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i

Na na na na waiting at the back door
They're around and the vultures come around
And you know that they won't, they won't us
Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us
And you come and sing and listen
I would not think about it but I'm not done
Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I

Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know some places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places
Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places

Or whatever. I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus. So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing. It would be, like, [*vocalizing*]. Like, very, like, beat. Now I'm just making weird sounds. Hope you like it![Verse 1]
I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Don't try me
Don't fight me
You be you and I'll be me

[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

[Verse 2]
Your mom and daddy's walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into
So sorry, don't worry
I'm sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do
[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

[Bridge]
Oh baby, don't persuade me
I know that you ain't used to no
So let me say it real slow

[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
And take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times

[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

[Chorus 2]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z

[Verse 1]
I can cast a spell
See, but you can't tell
Mix a special groove
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly
I will appear

[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

[Chorus 2]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z

[Verse 2]
I can set your knees
Like playing unto the seas
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
I got it, I got it
I got it, got it, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

[Chorus 2]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman (Every woman)
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

[Chorus 2]
Anything you want
I'm every woman
It's all in me (yeah, oh, yeah)
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Yeah, oh
I'm every woman
It's all in me

[?] bad days, tell me, I'll [?]
[?] look so sad? You feel [?]
[?] know you thought you had it
I know all about that
You had planned out, saw the [?]
You, I'm a dreamer, too
Lost the [?] but I'll be right [?]
And I'll take care of you

If you get knocked off your feet
I'll try to see it coming
I'll get a symphony to play that song [?] [love?]
Pick you up, take your hand, stop your crying
There's no chance you won't make it through
I'm looking out for you

Beneath those scared eyes
There's something wonderful
That you don't know you have
I know you're scared but I'd pass up a miracle
Just to hear you laugh

If you get tired of me, I'll pretend to let you go
If you need room to breathe, step back and watch you go

Sweet child, you've seen better days
But you know it's gonna be okay
Show me that smile you got from your father
It's gonna be fine just because you got my love, you got my love

[Verse 1]
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Bridge]
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

[Chorus]
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you

[Outro]
Uh-huh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world's a little colder now
But I'm keeping warm somehow

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you don't need you now

[Verse 2]
I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street
You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
That I've come too far to go back there again
My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name
[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you don't need you now

[Bridge]
I need you now
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I don't know where you are
I don't wonder where you are
I don't dream about you cause I don't need you now
I don't dream about the way
That I never heard you say
"I need you I need you"
I don't need you now

Don't need you
Don't need you now

[Verse 1]
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

[Verse 2]
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

[Bridge]
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

[Outro]
Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back



I loved you for a little, a little while
I think you know that!
It would have worked for a little
Except for that day you...
It's not like you to be here
When you said you won't!

But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
It's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain
It kills me to say this
It really does, it kills my heart!
But I might still love you
Reason we're just fallen apart
But it's not like me to answer
Gonna change my mind!

But in the pouring rain, You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
And it's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain

Oh, am I...
All I torn myself I would be losing!
But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?
My tears are falling down from the sky!
In the pouring rain, I can feel...
I wonder who you love tonight
Oh, in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
Oh, in the pouring rain!
In the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed my mind

[Verse 1]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

[Chorus]
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Verse 2]
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
[Pre-Chorus]
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

[Chorus]
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Bridge]
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

[Chorus - Variation]
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
[Outro]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile[Verse 1]
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)

(Ah-ah-ah, yeah)

[Intro]
To the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff, yes, I bought it
Please don't touch

[Verse One]
Keep talking and yes, that's fine
Could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on the tag
Come in with your bags, let me call you a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard, telling me how I'm such a fool
How I'm never gonna find a man like you, got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you, ever for a second, get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
[Verse Two]
So, go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What'd you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you were untrue, hauling her around in the truck that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys, hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard, telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking about, how I'm never gonna find a man like you
Got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you, ever for a second, get to thinking
You're irreplaceable[Verse 1]
I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
I got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Verse 2]
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)
[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
I got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul

[Bridge]
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
"So where we gonna go?"
I whisper in the dark
"Where we gonna go?"
I think he knows
[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
I got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)

[Verse 1]
When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

[Verse 2]
Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

[Verse 3]
Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

[Outro]
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
When it's time to go
You know, you know, you know, you know
When it's time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go

[Verse I]
... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

[Chorus]
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

[Verse 2]
You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

[Chorus]
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight
[Bridge]
Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight

[Chorus]
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

[Outro]
I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky[Verse 1]
How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

[Pre-Chorus]
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

[Verse 2]
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours
[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

[Verse 3]
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you
[Bridge]
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you, in you
Now I'm covered in you
In you

[Chorus]
Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Oh won't  you please let me
Back in your heart?

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

I wasn't you back(I want you back), ooh-ooh baby

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Verse 2]
Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you, oh
[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Bridge]
The night was so cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't see

[Chorus]
And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Outro]
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

[Verse 1]
It's 2 am, in your car
Windows down, past my street, memories start
Say it's in the past
You drive straight ahead
Thinking that I hate you now
But you still don't know what I never said

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish that you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
It's 2 am, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
And I think of you
We're crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Makes you wanna turn right back around

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Never hung up the phone like I did
I wish that you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish that you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

[Break]
You always knew how to push my buttons
You gave me everything and nothing
This mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would

[Verse 3]
It's 2 am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run, makes you wanna hide
Makes you wanna turn right back around

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Never hung up the phone like I did
I wish that you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Never hung up the phone like I did
I wish that you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would

[Outro]
I wish we could go back
And know what we were fighting for
I wish that you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would



[Verse 1]
It's 2AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

[Chorus 1]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
It's 2AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

[Chorus 2]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Post-Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I

[Bridge]
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish I, wish I)

[Verse 3]
2AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

[Chorus 2]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Outro]
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I wish you would

This is another way I've written songs recently. This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes "I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds." And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said "Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called "I Wish You Would", because Jack wrote back and said "I love that". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:

Okay so this is an idea called "I Wish You Would". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this

It's 2 am, in your car
Windows down, past my street the memories start
It's in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

Do you like it!?

[Verse 1]
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

[Verse 2]
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh, over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and  jump then fall into me
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall

[Bridge]
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
Whoa oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

[Outro]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah



[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair

[Pre-Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
My lover, my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tied
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher over I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she's the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her. When will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Bridge: Nelly
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
Now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Verse 1]
She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

[Pre-Chorus]
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

[Chorus]
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

[Verse 2]
I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, because  she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

[Pre-Chorus]
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now
[Chorus]
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

[Verse 3]
I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there

[Chorus]
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by

[Verse 4]
I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing why

I remember the eyes
Of the kid in the crowd
Who cut me down to size
Realizing is crying out loud
For every kid on stage
There's a kid in the crowd

[Verse 1]
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "Baby" like tryin' on clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

[Verse 2]
Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

[Bridge]
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once



[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special

[Chorus]
Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special



[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

[Verse 2]
I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 3]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

[Verse 4]
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Chorus]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

[Outro]
Just like our last



[Verse 1: Megan and Liz]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away

[Verse 2: Boyce Avenue]
I do recall now
The smell of the rain fresh on the pavement
You ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of my heart it jumped through my shirt
Hope you still feel my arms

[Chours: Megan and Liz & Boyce Avenue]
Now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 3:Megan and Liz]
I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did

[Verse 4: Boyce Avenue]
Because you love my handshake, meeting your father
Said he loved how I walk with my hands in my pockets
How I'd kiss you when you were in the middle of saying something
I pray that you still miss those rude interruptions

[Chours: Megan and Liz & Boyce Avenue]
Now I'll go sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is that I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Bridge: Megan and Liz & Boyce Avenue]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I'll feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
I never planned on making you cry
But not letting go would be living a lie

[Chours: Megan and Liz & Boyce Avenue]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Outro: Megan and Liz & Boyce Avenue]
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last...

[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know

[Outro]
Just like our last

[Verse 1]
The first shots fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, it's not what happened at all
There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you
But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're standing in the ring
And you made your first swing
And now we're fighting dirty
Won't somebody come say break it up

[Chorus]
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So gloves off, if this is how you want it
We had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise
No, no, I'm not the one who tore us apart
Let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine
Is she here? Is she's standing on the sidelines?
Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now I'm fighting dirty
But I ain't going down till they break it up

[Chorus]
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Now we're standing in the ring
Breaking everything that we've been building up so long
And I don't wanna do this break it up
But you're not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
Looks like we're going to war

[Chorus 2]
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And I try to not break down crying
No one's gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Looks like we're going to war
Oh, oh

[Outro]
The first shots fired
Everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I try to take you down
No, no, but if you wanna fight, baby, let's go

[Verse 1]
One daybreak, one heartache
Every once-upon-a-time
That black dress, happiness
Bubble baths and quarter lines

[Pre-Chorus]
They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

[Chorus]
Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

[Verse 2]
Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out bad
One last stands, new romance
Living for that love and person

[Pre-Chorus]
They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

[Chorus]
Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Ohh, yeah
Ohh

[Bridge]
No fighting, black riding
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things

[Outro]
Na na na...
Oh, yeah
Na na na...
Ohh, yeah
Na na na...



[Intro: Idris Elba & James Corden]
We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...

[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)

[Outro]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
I, I, I fancy you
Oh whoa, oh, I
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah

[Verse 1]
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

[Breakdown]
Will you take a moment?
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you
[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered[Verse 1]
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

[Spoken Interlude]
We have absolutely loved spending time in your town , and you have been so amazing to us
I mean, you guys know every single word and you've danced this entire night and it means the world to me and every single person you see on stage
Thank you

[Breakdown]
Will you take a moment?
And Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you
[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 1: Long Live]
I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus: Long Live]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge: Long Live]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

And hold on...
To spinning around...
Confetti...
Falls to the ground...

[Verse 1: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2: New Year's Day]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge: New Year's Day]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

[Transition: Long Live]

And Long live
(Please don't ever become a stranger)
The walls we crashed through
(Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
I had the time of my life
(Please don't ever become a stranger)
With you
(Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)

[Outro: Long Live]
And Long live
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live
All the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long long live the look and your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

[Verse 1]
Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready

[Chorus]
'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Bridge]
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

[Verse 3]
Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
(And now) I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you
(And now) Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Outro]
Long story short, it was a bad time
Long story short, I survived

[Verse 1]
I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going

[Verse 2]
They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

[Bridge]
I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

(Verse 1)
There you are
Standin' there like you don't know what to say
And I move like this
Here I am, racing myself, I wanna know what's coming now, what a waste

(Pre-Chorus)
Well all of that time, I thought you were mine
Was I just kidding myself?
For letting it go, and loving you so, don't you dare tell me not to look at you like that

(Chorus)
Gonna look at you like that, I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, I'm gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that

(Verse 2)
Won't you say, that we can still be friends
It doesn't work that way
And don't you dare think, that a pack of all my tears can take that
Crying out when I'm alone

(Pre-Chorus)
Doing right here, I'm crying right now, you can watch me crumble down, that's for breaking my heart, so baby don't stop, thinking you could ask me not to look at you like, that

(Chorus)
Gonna look at you like that, I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, I'm gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that
(Bridge)
Don't you tell me to be strong, and make it harder than it has to be, after you don't call, and remember what you've done to me

(Chorus)
'Cause I'm gonna look at you like that, gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, after what you put me through, I'm gonna have to let you know,[???]

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah
Gonna look at you like that
Look at you, Look at you, Look at you, like that
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah..

[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me-
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me-
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me-
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me-)
"I'm sorry, the old Kenton Chen can't come to the phone right now
"Why? Oh, 'cause he's dead!" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me-
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me-
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, and we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever and, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, and we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever and, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever and, ah
Take me out, take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go", and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go", and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
[Chorus 3]
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

[Verse 1]
I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think Romeo would be my kind of guy
I want a love that's sweeter than roses
And for me this is how it's gonna be

[Chorus]
Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

[Verse 2]
Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
I'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
It's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect

[Chorus]
Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And he music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

I want my own little storybook ending
We'll make it up as we go

[Chorus]
There's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet
I want love they haven't thought of yet

[Verse 1]
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside?
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Bridge]
I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Outro]
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out


[Verse 1]
There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you

[Verse 2]
She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you

[Bridge]
Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you aren't so far away

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there
[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Idris Elba & Both]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity, Macavity
Macavity, Macavity

[Outro: Idris Elba, Taylor Swift]
When a crime's discovered, then
Macavity's not there[Verse 1]
Your feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

[Chorus]
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

[Verse 2]
You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

[Chorus]
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You
[Verse 3]
I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

[Chorus]
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

[Outro]
Made Up You
Oh oh
Made Up You[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say "move on," but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but

[Outro]
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that

[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say "move on," but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]

No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out

And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]

'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me

[Outro]
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that



[Verse 1]
I need you more than I know how to mention
And I'd give forever to get your attention
Be you're summer midnight with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

[Chorus]
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

[Verse 2]
All of the days that I couldn't get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

[Chorus]
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

[Bridge]
Heaven had quite the time
To figure this life out
But baby I've got mine
To give you everything you dream about

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

[Chorus]
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

[Verse 1]
He's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine
People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill

[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

[Verse 2]
Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah
[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

[Bridge]
Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolin

[Verse 1]
Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Verse 2]
Never be so polite
You forget your power
Never wield such power
You forget to be polite

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Bridge]
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Outro]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around

[Verse 1]
She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said, "Oh my my my"

[Chorus 1]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my my my my

[Verse 2]
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh my my my"
[Chorus 2]
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck, and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

[Verse 3]
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

[Chorus 3]
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said "I do" and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

[Outro]
I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my[Verse 1]
She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

[Chorus]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did

And you looked at me, got down on one knee

You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

[Outro]
And I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my
Thank you so much!I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your dents
Smiled at your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But life's too long
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the lines long
And don't you tell me
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well I say, cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
'Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down

Matches, now

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like
[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh)
Baby, that's the fun of me
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man
Well you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know, what you don't know
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your walk by lies and your humiliation
You, have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know, what you don't know
Someday, I'll be, living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion but
Nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
But someday, I'll be, living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean. Yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

[Verse 1]
Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

[Verse 2]
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasn't been the same since
That boy she went ran off with, well, I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me

[Bridge]
When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said I'm sorry for waking you up but I didn't know who else to call
Or where else to go

[Verse 3]
Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
We're not as young, but we're still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when we're old, we're still going to be

[Outro]
Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear
In the summer shade

[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You have pointed out my flaws again

And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
All you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

[Breakdown]
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so-?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so-?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so-?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so-?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover

Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me

[SANTANA]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:


Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Ah, oh, oh

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
When everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
Oh

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it now

Oh oh yeeah

You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say "Can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch?"
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

Oh but we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yeah, yeah, this is what I thought about
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine, yeah

Oh I
And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the "Goodbye"
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
You're the best thing that's ever been mine"
(Hold on make it last, hold on never turn back)
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
You're the best thing that's ever been mine"[Verse 1]

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Verse 2]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Bridge]
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

[Outro]
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight[Verse 1]

[Outro]
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight

[Verse 1]
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Bridge]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), just thought you should know

[Outro]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"



[Verse 1]
I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But I'm not going to talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter
But I'm not going to talk about that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la la, la la la

[Verse 2]
I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me
But I'm not going to say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public
But I'm not going to say that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

[Verse 3]
You might think I'd bring up Joe
The guy who broke up with me on the phone
But I'm not going to mention him
In my monologue
Hey Joe! I'm doing real well
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not going to brag about that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
La la la

[Verse 4]
And if you're wondering if I might
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight
[mouths "Hi Taylor!", blows him a kiss]
I'm not going to comment on that
In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

[Verse 5]
You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue
But there's nothing more to say
'Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue

[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la, la la la la la
That was my SNL monologue

[Verse 1]
I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

[Chorus]
If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

[Verse 2]
Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you

[Chorus]
And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

[Verse 3]
They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

[Chorus]
Becasue if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

[Outro]
I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever

[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, oh, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed

Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
When I'm screaming at the sky
And when you can't sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Outro]
Yeah, look at how my tears ricochet
Look at all of my tears, turning into your tears
Look at all my tears ricochet[Verse 1]
Something about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

[Verse 2]
You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

[Bridge]
Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

[Verse 1]
On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance

[Chorus 1]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

[Verse 2]
You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

[Chorus 1]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

[Chorus 2]
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

[Bridge]
And it's safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

[Chorus]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

[Chorus 2]
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

[Outro]
Going back to Nashville
I'm going back to Nashville
Going back to Naaaaahh....
Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why?


[Refrain]
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left on my car
I need you now
Words that said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you, but you never came
My world's a little colder now
But I'm keeping warm somehow

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited, so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you, don't need you now

[Refrain]
I need you now
Words I heard you whispered to me
And we will walk you down a one-way street
You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But i'd come too far to go back there again
My heart, my mind, my mother's a chain
Your mind as well forget my name

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited, so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you, don't need you now

[Bridge]
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left on my car

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited, so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you now

[Outro]
And I'm not what you want
I won't wonder where you are
I won't dream a thousand stars
I don't need you now
I don't need you by the rain
And I never heard you say
I need you, I need you
I don't need you now
Don't need you
I don't need you now

[Verse 1]
I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

[Pre-Chorus]
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

[Verse 2]
Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you
[Pre-Chorus]
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

[Verse 3]
I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fade

[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

[Chorus]
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret

If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple

And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies

At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do

Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up[Verse 1]
Look at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I want to know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

[Chorus]
And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

[Verse 2]
All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you
[Chorus]
And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

[Verse 3]
All I really want to say is I need to be
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mind

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and boys are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace (Ahh)
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing (Yeah) to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So, come on, come along with me
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
The best people in life are free
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing, and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
[Breakdown]
Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle, oh-oh
But every night with us is like a dream

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

He did it
He did it

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
She says, "I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Garden
At her job or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
(She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

[Outro: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he-
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he-
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died

[Verse 1]
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can't

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah

[Verse 2]
The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
[Verse 3]
And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me

[Outro]
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin

[Verse 1]
Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

[Chorus]
And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

[Verse 2]
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

[Chorus]
Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything

[Verse 1]
It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they're right
You were outnumbered this time

[Chorus]
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run

[Verse 2]
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget

[Pre-Chorus]
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun
[Chorus]
Only one thing can save us
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young; Don't say you're too tired to fight)
Only the young (Only the young; It's just a matter of time)
Only the young (Only the young; Up there's the finish line)
Only the young
Can run

[Post-Chorus]
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (Can run)
Up there's the finish line (So run, and run, and run)
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (So run)
Up there's the finish line (And run, and run, and run)

[Outro]
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young

[Verse 1]
Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were calling my name
When your face faded from view

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

[Chorus]
Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

[Verse 2]
Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were going to be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a Nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the Indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

[Chorus]
Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

[Breakdown]
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

[Outro]
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is oursElevator buttons and morning air
Stranger silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs...

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury is out, but my choice is you...

So don't you worry your pretty little mind

I'll fight their doubt and give you faith

[Verse 1]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

[Outro]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song



[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
Well, I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Da da da da

[Bridge]
Well, I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again
Oh yeah
Oh oh yeah

[Outro]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
Thank you so much!



[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
(Out of the woods)
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said, "I'm setting you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
(Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Are we?)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good

[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Bridge]
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Outro]
You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want

[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions

Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

[Verse 1]
Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you?
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek?
'Cause, baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me, sayin'

[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

[Verse 2]
I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet

[Chorus]
And if you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

[Verse 3]
Love was all we knew, and faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had, and for one summer, you were mine
Sayin'

[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least I'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved



[Verse 1]
I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
'Cause I ain't trying to show maturity

[Chorus]
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

[Verse 2]
I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess
He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

[Chorus]
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart
In permanent marker
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Oh, just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart
In permanent marker

[Outro]
In permanent marker
Oh, permanent marker, yeah



[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn[Intro]
This one's called "Picture to Burn"
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Well, state the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
And by the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
Well, there's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?

[Refrain]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

[Refrain]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

Are you ready for it?

[Post-Chorus]
Night, in my dreams
We'd do, baby
Yeah, in the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Outro]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong
[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Yeah red
Burning red
Burning red

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

R.E.V.E.N.G.E
My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery
Gon' give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B.A.D
Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry, I'm getting my
R.E.V.E.N.G.E

[Verse-2]
So I'm gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory everywhere we've ever been
I don't hang-out at smokey bars, but I know we'll see you there
And I'll make you hear me laughing, like I just don't care
I know you hate my friends, so tonight I called them all
And later on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby!

[Hook]
R.E.V.E.N.G.E
My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery
Gon' give you what you gave to me

[Interlude]
S-A-N-I-T-Y
I hope you lose yours tonight
You've made me crazy too long
And so I'm working on

[Hook]
R.E.V.E.N.G.E
My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery
Gon' give you what you gave to me

[Outro]
Baby, baby
R.E.V.E.N.G.E
Oh, and give you what you gave to me
Oh

[Verse 1]
Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I, I'm right where you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight"
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared

[Chorus]
Right where you left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

[Verse 2]
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me

[Bridge]
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right
I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on

[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight"
I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
'Cause I'm right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong

[Chorus]
I'm right where
You left me
You left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever



I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong

[Verse 1]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtain room and this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Outro]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

There's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it
'Cause I swear out there ain't where
You outta be
So catch a ride or catch a cab
Don't you know that I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby run cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run
So baby run

Oh if you ain't got a suitcase
Get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby just come back
There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it
Baby break it

Baby run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

Run to me
Baby run
Run to me
So baby run
Run
Oh baby run



[Verse 1]
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

[Chorus]
We had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Verse 2]
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me

[Chorus]
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Bridge]
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back

[Chorus]
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair



[Verse 1]
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light

I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2]
Don't you dare look out your window, darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on

Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone...
Gone

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Interlude]
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound...

[Outro]
Oooh, oooh-whoa-whoa, oooh, oooh oh
Oooh (uhmm), oooh (hmm)-whoa-whoa, oooh, oooh oh
Home

I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes

[Verse 1]
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2]
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Outro]
Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound



[Instrumental]



[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Joy Williams of the Civil Wars backup]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with John Paul White of the Civil Wars backup]
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when (the) music's gone
Gone

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Bridge: Taylor Swift with the Civil Wars backup]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Outro: Taylor Swift with the Civil Wars backup]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh oh oh



I'm still wearing my blue jeans
No I don't know what you mean
I'm still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
I've always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
I've always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
I've always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking...

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl



[Chorus]
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

[Verse 1]
Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

[Chorus]
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that is not a lot
I have been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me

[Chorus]
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I do not mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

        

[Verse 1]
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days

[Bridge]
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days
And there never was a cloudy day
There never was a cloudy day

[Verse 1]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Verse 2]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
[Bridge]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long

[Verse 1]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Verse 2]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

[Bridge]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Joe Jonas]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & (Jonas Brothers)]

Oh, whoa

I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no

You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me[Intro]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me

[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
And Yyu say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me
[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
Well, I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no, no, no
[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me
Thank you[Verse 1]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2]
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ our Saviour is born

[Verse 3]
Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

[Outro]
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Christ the Saviour is born

[Verse 1]
Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand
And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 1]
I've seen a million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want to speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Verse 2]
Still through the haze I can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 2]
I've played a thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want to sing to you
Waited on a wire
Staring at the fire
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Chorus 3]
I've walked a thousand miles
Smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Outro]
So walk with me as the sweet wind dances
I'll write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights

[Verse 1]
See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes...
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes...
[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes...
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes...
[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

[Bridge]
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting? (One, two, three)

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place (Pieces fall)
Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes...
I'm yours to keep (Oh)
And I'm yours to lose (Baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
I do bad things with you
So it goes...
[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes


[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to
[Bridge: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

[Spoken Intro]
I don't think you should wait, you speak now
Drop everything now

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
Well I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Interlude]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Drop everything now
Take away (take away) the pain
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Drop everything now
(Take away, take away the pain)
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Outro]
And the sparks fly[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby
And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me
Gonna strike this match tonight
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'd love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

[Intro]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Verse 1]
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you)

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said "speak now"

[Interlude]
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
(Hehe!)

[Chorus]
So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "speak now"

[Chorus - Variation]
And you say
"Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door"
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
"Speak now"

Prologue'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I've always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens.

Real life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.

I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up. When we didn't say 'I love you.' When we should've said 'I'm sorry.' When we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help.

These songs are made up of words I didn't say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world.

Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you'll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.

What you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you'll stutter and you'll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest.

So say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you'll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying 'I could've, but it's too late now.'

There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you'll know it.

I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.

Love, Taylor

[Verse 1]
Days go by, I wonder if you hear me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

[Chorus]
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

[Verse 2]
He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

[Chorus]
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

[Verse 3]
Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

[Chorus]
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you
[Outro]
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is you[Chorus]
I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

[Chorus]
And I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Verse 2]
He said, "Look at you
Worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"
[Chorus]
Like, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Breakdown]
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
[Outro]
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know, is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
[Chorus]
And I never (Never) saw you coming
And I'll never (Never) be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

[Breakdown]
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
And I never (Never) saw you coming
And I'll never
(So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same
(We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild)
[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don't let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

[Verse 1]
Corey's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows
These pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home, saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

[Chorus]
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Verse 2]
Corey finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away
I should say
Hey, by the way
[Chorus]
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Bridge]
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

[Chorus]
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
[Outro]
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
When you walked in wearing a football helmet
And said, "Okay, let's talk"
And I said

[Chorus]
Stay, 'cause I've been loving you for quite some time
And you think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you 'cause you have given me
No choice but to

[Chorus]
Stay, 'cause I've been loving you for quite some time
And you think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

[Breakdown]
Stay, I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else will love me when I get mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay

[Chorus]
Stay, I've been loving you for quite some time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
I think that it's best if we both stay
I think that it's best if we both stay
I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, "Okay, let's talk"
And I said

[Chorus]

I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

[Bridge]

My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

[Breakdown]
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Outro]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
(Ha-ha-ha, it's so fun)

[Stay Stay Stay]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I've read you should never leave a fight unresolved

[Ho Hey]
Ho, hey, ho, hey
So show your family
All the blood that I would bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song

I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you 
You belong with me 
So please, please

[Stay Stay Stay]
Stay, stay, stay
I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay[Verse 1]
Let me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you

[Chorus]
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

[Verse 2]
I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside

[Chorus]
Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy
[Bridge]
What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, cause that's what it cost
I just wanna be everything you need
Cause you're everything to me

[Chorus]
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

[Outro]
Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skin

[Verse 1]
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl
He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you," and I
I said, "I've been there too a few times"

[Chorus]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
(A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh
(Out of style)

[Chorus]
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (And when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style



[Chorus]

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 1]

Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time

[Chorus]

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
Let me hear you please make some noise for my band

[Verse 2]

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go
Give it up for my guitarist LA!

[Chorus]

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

[Bridge]

Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said
"Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

[Chorus]

"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say yes"

[Bridge]

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

[Chorus]

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

[Verse 1]
What a thing to see
What a thing to be
What a perfect love, what a perfect home
'Cause every time she walks
And every time she talks
Is every time he knows what a perfect world he's living on

[Pre-Chorus]
But whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

[Chorus]
And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

[Verse 2]
With her midnight hair
And with his favorite stare
She's a southern belle, he's a rockout king
When she looks around
Oh, she knows she's found
Such a perfect life, such a perfect thing
[Pre-Chorus]
And whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

[Chorus]
And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

[Bridge]
Oh, there's a reason for every season
There's a change within the range of every heart
But the reason and the season
Seem to be right so far

[Chorus]
And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find
He calls her "Sugar"

[Verse 1]
Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

[Chorus]
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Fall Out Boy's from Chicago!

[Verse 2]
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you here from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

[Chorus]
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

[Verse One]
I walk in the room there's a beautiful sunshine ray
Across the room
Then I hear the phone ring walk to it and I don't know what to say
Hello, good day
But what I do know, is that tonight is gonna be the night, when

[Chorus]
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
When, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
When, I'll say, oh, I'll say I love him too
And, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home listenin' to the radio
And, he says he really loves me too, he'll do anything

[Verse Two]
Oh, I walk through the door there's a beautiful moonlight shine
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkin' what I did today
With him
But what I do know, is that, I love him too
And the next time I see
Him walking down the street(down the street)
I'll think about this time, that was as beautiful as sunshine, oh

[Chorus]
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
Yeah, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
And I'll say, I love you too, yeah, I love you
Oh, I'll say, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home, listenin' to the radio
Then, he says, he really loves me and he'll do anything
[Bridge]
I look in his brown eyes, and see a surprise
It's like a present that you open
Oh, and do you know, oh, do you know
What that surprise is?
It's love
And the next time I see him walking down the streets in his old white T-shirt, I'll always remember
This time, that was as beautiful as sunshine

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, sunshine, oh, oh, oh, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, was as beautiful as sunshine[Verse 1]
Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you?"
I say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Verse 2]
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day
[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Bridge]
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

[Breakdown]
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

[Chorus - Variation]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
When you come back down

[Verse 1]
This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Verse 2]
Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Bridge]
You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Outro]
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar

[Verse 1]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh)
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and (I, I, I, I)
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees (eh, eh)
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 1]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

[Verse 2]
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh)
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever
[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

[Bridge]
I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever
[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is no
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Some day you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
You eyes wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
You eyes wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
You eyes wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud

And then they call your name and we
Put your picture in a frame
You now that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was no
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
You eyes wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
You eyes wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Is sweeter than fiction
Is sweeter, yeah
Is sweeter, is sweeter
Sweeter than fiction

[Verse 1]
Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

[Chorus]
You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

[Verse 2]
Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times
I remember
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while
And I still think about back when"

[Chorus]
We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

[Outro]
Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeahIn the 1960s and '70s, Pattie Boyd stood at the intersection of fashion, rock 'n' roll, art, and fame. Widely considered one of the greatest muses of all time, Boyd, who was married first to George Harrison and later to Eric Clapton, inspired the hits "Something" by the Beatles, and "Layla" and "Wonderful Tonight" by Clapton. Recently I devoured this intriguing woman's memoir, Wonderful Tonight. A few weeks later, I had the pleasure of sitting down with her in the kitchen of her beautiful Kensington flat. As the sunlight poured through the windows, her blue eyes lit up as she spoke. There is a playful quality about her and, surprisingly-considering how much she has experienced in her life-a lightness.

[Verse 1: Drake & Taylor Swift]
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country
Them boys up to something, they just not just bluffing
You don't have to call, I hit my dance like Usher, woo
I just found my tempo like I'm DJ Mustard, woo
I hit that Ginobili with my left hand up like wo--

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

Can't he tell that I can't breathe?

Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

It was something like a perfect start to
This love yesterday but now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes know how to look right through me
It's like, you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you

Could you tell me, what did i do
Because it can't be
We're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me
Is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

Take time, to realise I know that
People change their minds
But that was something i wished you would say
To my face
But you ran away

Could you tell me, what did i do
Because it can't be
We're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me
Is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

If i had a reason
Or a simple goodbye
Baby even a lie
Yeah, yeah

Tell me, what did i do
Because baby
Suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me
Is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
And tell me

Oooh yeah
Tell me
Tell me



[Verse 1]
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Verse 2]
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Bridge]
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why)

[Outro]
I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know

[Verse 1]
You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin'
Really somethin' for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
But, baby, I was betting on you

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so"
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Verse 2]
I said, "let them say we're crazy," you said, "let's go fishing tonight"
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was looking into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so"
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Bridge]
Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me
[Chorus]
I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
Had to go and listen to my mama's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Verse 1]
Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here, and

[Chorus]
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here, and

[Chorus]
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

[Bridge]
When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back, back to where I feel so free
Well, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee

[Chorus]
I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
And I'm in Tennessee



[Verse 1]
Like one of those fireflies
Oh, it looks so good till it's in your hand
It's like one of those memories
Where you can't let go but you just can't stand
It's like one of those crazy dreams
And the permanent screens in the magazines
Saying, "Why'd I love?
All it does is break your heart"

[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

[Verse 2]
Like one of those people
With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face
It's like one of those stories
Where the hero dies in the very last race
Like one of those endless cries
And the crazy lies of a hurting child
Saying, "Why did love have to hurt?
It broke my heart"

[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

[Bridge]
I always liked to think
That I was always brave enough
To try to master any push and shove
Well I guess I never qualified love

[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

Oh, I guess that's life
Well, I guess that's life



[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
No sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why? All the possibilities
Well, I was wrong

[Chorus 1: Hayley Williams with (Taylor Swift)]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities
I'm sure you've heard

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with (Hayley Williams)]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)

[Bridge: Hayley Williams]
Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!

[Breakdown: Taylor Swift and Hayley Williams]
Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah

[Chorus: Hayley Williams and Taylor Swift]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah
Now, I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, woah

[Verse 1]
I said I know
He said need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
I watched him go
He watched me crushed to the floor
On my knees, just like that
He said, "When can I come back?"

[Chorus]
I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when

[Verse 2]
I said I know
He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this
'Cause I let you go, you let me think
That I'll be fine without you
Imagine that!
So baby I'll come back
[Chorus]
I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when

[Bridge]
And I said all this playing
Did you ever think of me?
And he said

[Chorus]
I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when

[Outro]
I said I know
He said I need some time, need some space[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinee
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rose flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinee
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Verse 2]

[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat

They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat



[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today
[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

[Chorus]
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today[Verse 1]
I'm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring, kinda girl
Hey, yeah, what's the word on you?
Lay low
I'm a mission rebel, angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

[Chorus]
But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

[Verse 2]
I'm poetry
Complicated, simply stated
Hey yeah, baby, how about you?
I was born free
I'm a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up, I don't get up
I just get down, yeah
[Chorus]
But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

[Verse 3]
It's raining on Sunday
There's nothin' on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You're the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can't stop thinkin' about you
I bet you're thinkin' of me too

[Chorus]
Well, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of meWhere will the music industry be in 20 years, 30 years, 50 years?

[Verse 1]
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Verse 2]
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Bridge]
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you



[Verse 1]
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?

No, not without you



[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcee do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dali

[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time

[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody]
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

[Chorus 1]
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

[Chorus 1]
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

[Pre-Chorus 3]
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

[Chorus 2]
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Like trying on clothes, salute to me like the American dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go

Salute to me, I'm your American Queen

And all the boys with their expensive cars
And their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

[Taylor (lightly)]
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago

Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once1 Day Later[Bridge]
Is the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on your roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
All at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoaThe Next Day[Taylor]
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"
Yeah, thanks!
Hanging out with you guys is enough, I'm starting to do weird melody, weird harmonies
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"
"Your love is, your love is," okay
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just try your best, try everything you can
Don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away

[Chorus]
It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

[Verse Two]
Hey, you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own
So don't buy in love right now
Just be yourself, it doesn't matter if it's good enough for someone else

[Chorus]
It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright(x2)

[Verse Three]
Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just do your best, do everything you can
Don't you worry what their bitter hearts are gonna say
[Chorus]
It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright

[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing)
And that was the moment I knew

[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew

[Verse 1]
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Verse 2]
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me
[Chorus]
Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Bridge]
And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
What I mean is

[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
[Outro]
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you[Verse 1]
I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Verse 2]
You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything
[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Bridge]
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Outro]
Oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

[Outro]
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Can I please see you jump?
[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less

Oh (Now, now, now)

I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down

The End

[Verse 1]
If I could be sweet
I would but first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
Its your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

[Chorus]
If I could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape

[Verse 2]
You let me drown
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Let's look for some common ground
Oh baby
Times been getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully, you don't leave me
Wanna take you with me

[Chorus]
If I could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape

Let go of the ones who hurt you
Let go of the ones you outgrow
Let go of the words they hurl your way
as you're walking out the door
The only thing cut and dry
In this hedge-maze life
Is the fact that their words will cut
but your tears will dry

They don't tell you this when you are young
You can't hold on to everything
Can't show up for everyone
You pick your poison
Or your cure
Phone numbers you know by heart
And the ones you don't answer any more

Hold on to the faint recognition in
the eye of a stranger
As it catches you in its lustrous net
How quickly we become intertwined
How wonderful it is to forget
All the times your intuition failed you
But it hasn't killed you yet
Hold on to childlike whims and moonlight
swims and your blazing self-respect
And if you drive the roads of this town
Ones you've gone down so many times before
Flashback to all the times
Life nearly ran you off the road
But tonight your hand is steady
Suddenly you'll know
The trick to holding on
Was all that letting go



[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

[Chorus]
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
[Outro]
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you[Verse 1]
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you
Your face jumped right in my way
As things lately do
Oh baby can't you see
The thought of you makes a mess of me
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you

[Chorus]
And Now I
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you

Oh, ah

[Verse 2]
I get lost when I drive around town
Thinkin' 'bout your smile
Always ending' up
Your side of town
And I don't know why
Must be somethin' under this hood
Nobody's strong like you
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you
[Chorus]
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you

[Verse 3]
Your eyes are the color of
The great big sea
The one I go swimmin' in
Every time you look at me

[Chorus]
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you
[Outro]
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you[Verse 1]
Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that don't offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

[Verse 2]
These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if they're half as stubborn as me
They'll just keep on shining bright
I ain't ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling ain't strong
I'll just move on
And leave this in my past


[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how I'll act today
Until you find somebody new
So I've been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Can't call it love if you ain't in it

[Verse 3]
Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still don't know
Oh and it troubles me so


[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how I'll feel today
I see you found somebody new
And I've been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can't call it love if you ain't in it

[Repeat Chorus]
[Outro]
Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smile

[Verse 1]
Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

[Verse 2]
It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

[Bridge]
Were you a present from a father to a son?
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone?
Hey, did some primadonna love you
'Til she got her fame and fortune?
I won't do that to you

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend?
This here guitar
You're my guitar
This here guitar

[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Outro]
At least I'm trying

[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back

And maybe I don't quite know what to say

[Verse 1]
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It's like I'm melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

[Chorus]
Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Verse 2]
Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can't take my eyes off you

[Chorus]
Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Bridge]
All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh, baby, here we are

[Chorus]
Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
Oh, this is really happening
Oh, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Tell me
You'll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening

[Outro]
Tell me, oh
You'll always need me
(need me, tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening



[Verse 1]
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It's like I'm melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

Tell me you'll never leave me

Oh, oh, baby
Tell me you'll always need me

Oh, that this is really happening

[Verse 1]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

[Bridge]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(He didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

[Chorus 1]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

[Chorus 2]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)

[Bridge]
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need
[Chorus 2]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
This love, this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Intro: T-Pain]
Hey Hey, T-Swizzle (T-Swizzle)
T-Pizzle (T-Pizzle)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I'm like eight foot fo', blonde hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun, no I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents, but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster, you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delights
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift & T-Pain & Both]
I had a dream last night
I had high top Nikes
I had diamonds in my mouth
And diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing
I'm on a boat, whoa oh-oh
'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty I'm a take ya
You can call me T-Sweezy
Now I'm a rap star
Hey, It's a thug story
Now tell 'em who you are
Singer turned gangster
You don't want to fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee

[Bridge: T-Pain]
T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story now can you get with that?

[Outro: Taylor Swift & T-Pain]
What? What? I knit sweaters, yo!
What? What? Don't test me (beep)!
Hey, hold on...
Hold on, I didn't even say anything
I didn't even s-
What?
I said Yo
Yup
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't even swear
She didn't, she didn- she didn't even swear
Hello? Ugh!



[Verse 1]
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, 'cause I know you

[Chorus]
Hold on
Baby, you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

[Verse 2]
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

[Chorus]
Hold on
Baby, you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
Hold on
Baby, you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

[Outro]
You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby



[Verse 1]
Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street?
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Verse 2]
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me?
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Bridge]
You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along



I've been a Taylor Swift fan for as long as I can remember. But it wasn't until I met and got to know her that I understood how wonderful a person she truly is.

Taylor makes the job of creating music for millions of people look easy. It all comes from her-her belief in magic and love, and her ability to be as honest and raw as possible. She's the master of putting the perfect amount of thought into not overthinking, and that's why her music connects so well.

I was so lucky to be able to open for a handful of her stadium shows on the 1989 World Tour. And I quickly learned that the magic of Taylor Swift doesn't come from the lights, dancers or fireworks (although all of that is incredible) but from the electrifying connection that she has with the people who are there to see her. There's an overwhelming feeling in the air. The feeling of your heart racing in your chest with  excitement-so much so that by the time you get to "Love Story," all you want to do is pick up your phone and text every person you know to say how much you love them. The feeling is so thick, you feel like you could reach out and grab it to keep forever.

Taylor makes anyone older feel young again and anyone young feel they can do anything. It's so rare and so special. If there is one thing I want to achieve in my career and life, it's that.



He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said "That's a lie"

Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him
All summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness

I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here to see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read from three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that
It's nice to believe

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness

I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standing on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness

I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Ah, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said "That's a lie"



[Verse 1]

And the first thing that you'll read is:
"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

[Chorus]
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest

I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me

[Verse 1]
You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "that's a lie"
Just a boy in a pickup truck
That had a funny way of getting stuck
On backroads at night

[Pre-Chorus]
I was right there beside you all summer long
Then in time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
Thanking God that you weren't here
To see me like that
In a box beneath my bed
Sits a letter that you never read
From three summers back
[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard not to find it all bittersweet
But looking back on all of that it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song

The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

[Bridge]
Been back a couple times since then
And I didn't look you up
But some trains you can't catch again
You gotta leave it as it was

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
When you think Tim McGraw
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me
[Outro]
You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "that's a lie"[Spoken Intro]
This is the song that got it all started for me
It's called "Tim McGraw"

[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Outro]
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Thank you so much[Verse 1]
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Verse 2]
I parked my car right between the Methodist
And the school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
[Bridge]
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
'Tis the damn season

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
[Outro]
It always leads to you and my hometownI write this to explain why I'll be holding back my album, 1989, from the new streaming service, Apple Music. I feel this deserves an explanation because Apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans. I respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries.

I'm sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I'm not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.

This is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field...but will not get paid for a quarter of a year's worth of plays on his or her songs.

These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.

I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period... even if it is free for the fans trying it out.

Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.

But I say to Apple with all due respect, it's not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don't ask you for free iPhones. Please don't ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.

Taylor[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around

[Chorus]
Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Bridge]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down
[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Outro]
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 1]
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Verse 2]
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen, I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
You're so much older and wiser and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Bridge]
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

[Chorus 2]
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Outro]
I sit and watch you

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quick sand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I like it

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
Forever going with the flow but you're friction

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I like it
[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home

[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home

[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I ...
[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

[Chorus 1]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous

And I will follow you, follow you home
Follow you, follow you home

[Chorus 2]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I

[Breakdown]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
Follow you, follow you home

And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
[Outro]
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I, like it

[Verse 1: Boys Like Girls]
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
Hey, you know, this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

[Chorus: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

[Verse 2: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

[Chorus: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Boys Like Girls]
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought, hey (Hey, hey)

[Chorus: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
Maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone

[Outro: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
And I'm thinking, ooh, I can't live without you
'Cause, baby, two is better than one
There's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
But I'll figure out with all that's said and done
Two is better than one
Two is better than one

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
I may be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

[Verse 1]
Are you trying to make me fall?
'Cause with a face like that, baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

[Verse 2]
Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

[Bridge]
Na na na na na na na na na na na
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh..


[Verse 1]
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Verse 2]
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Bridge]
I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh



[Verse 1]
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream

You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Verse 2]
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream

In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Bridge]
I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together

You got to come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world[Verse 1]
If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me
If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby

[Chorus]
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

[Verse 2]
It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall
But here we are in so deep, soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby
[Chorus]
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me

[Bridge]
We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

[Chorus]
So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me
[Outro]
Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look now

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying this is it, i've had enough, 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
Then you come around again and say
Baby, i miss you and i swear i'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say i hate you, we break up, you call me, i love you

We called it off again last night

And me falling for it screaming that i'm right

[Transition: TIWWCHNT]
Oh, and here's to my real friends
Oh, and here's to my baby
They didn't care about the he-said-she-said
We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Verse 1: TIWWCHNT]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2: TIWWCHNT]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

[Pre-Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
If only you weren't so shady

[Bridge: TIWWCHNT]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said-she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
(And here's to my baby)
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(He didn't care about that he-said-she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

Turn WYCD on
You're
On your Grunwald
Back from the Amazon
Ah huh huh

He's here
With doctor Don
I heard
They dropped him off
In the amazon
Ah huh huh

He caught an Anaconda
Ate some piranhas
That's kinda disgusting
But whatever
Makes you happy
And I heard
Some naked boy
Showed him around
Yeah
Grunwald's
Back in town[Verse 1]
I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy
When I let too much go
Love's a little messy and you are too
Right now I'm scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasn't gonna stray
Swore I'd never let a man in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the last thing I needed today

[Chorus]
And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Verse 2]
Gone and spilled my coffee
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Can't talk to my friends
Without you coming up
It's even kind of cute
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good
Right next to mine
[Pre-Chorus]
You're the last thing I needed tonight

[Chorus]
And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Bridge]
I'm acting like a girl
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring
About anything but you

[Chorus]
And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction[Verse 1]
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York (New soundtrack)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York[Verse 1]
We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were going to buy someday
And we were happy

[Verse 2]
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sort of how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were going to buy someday
And we were happy
[Bridge]
Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy, we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
Yeah, we were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We were happy[Verse 1]
What do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you want to go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try

[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

[Verse 2]
What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know it's real
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah
[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

[Bridge]
My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?
What do you say?

[Outro]
What do you say?
What do you say?

[Verse 1]
She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk

[Verse 2]
School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it
Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

[Chorus]
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you got to love her
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear

[Verse 4]
She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date, can't wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
She thinks about it
Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again
Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer

[Chorus]
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you got to love her
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wear

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Intermission]

[Verse 3]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Outro]
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now

[Verse 1]
You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But don't ruin yourself I aren't your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

[Hook]
I want to talk about what you are that I aren't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

[Verse 2]
I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I tell them, "this is what I do"
And it's what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume
And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition

[Hook]
I want to talk about what you are that I aren't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games

[Hook]
So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be, girl, and who I've always been

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
Cause they're all wrong
I know better, cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
That last kiss, I'll cherish, until we meet again
My darling, who knew?

Because P!nk is from Philly, ladies and gentlemen!

I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
They can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that make me feel
So
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Make you feel unpretty too

That's another song by an artist from Philly, I wanna see if you know it

When she fell, she fell apart.
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends

When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
"Whatever you say, it is not right."
"Whatever you do, it is not enough."
"Your kindness is fake."
"Your pain is manipulative."

When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.

When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes

When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.
When she turned to go home,
She heard the echoes of new words
"May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice"
And even louder:
"without your past,
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
...here."

And in the death of her reputation,
She felt truly alive.

[Instrumental]



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa (Ah-aah, haa)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday when you leave me, I'd bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning (Burning) it (It) down (Down)
Someday when you leave me, I'll bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around (Around)

[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha (Ah-aah-aah-aah-aah-hafhaa)
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa



[Enchanted]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Wildest Dreams]
He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
He said no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)

Ooh

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go

[Wildest Dreams]
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around (follow you around)
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again, even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
(Even if it's just in your)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)

[Enchanted]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go

In your

Wildest dreams (ah ah)

Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man[Verse 1]

Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Baby, every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Intro]
Ok, here's the Westerly one, written in Westerly

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from the look on your face
Drown in the current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And it was only one game I'd die  to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Spoken]
And then I was thinking like a choral section like ...

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 1]
Flashing lights, and we
Took a wrong turn, and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
[Verse 2]
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
Whoa, in Wonderland
[Bridge]
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad
Oh

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Last forever (Ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better
Never better (Ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
And life was never worse but never better
In Wonderland

[Verse 1]
I can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

[Verse 2]
I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

[Verse 3]
And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do

[Chorus]
I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

[Verse 1]
Once the last drop of rain, has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
You leave it muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how we used to be
Like the dollar in your pocket, that's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[Chorus]
I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, held on
God knows, too long, you wasted my time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
No amount of freedom gets you clean
I still got you all over me

[Verse 2]
Guess the worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "don't you wish you had me" grin
I did, so I smile, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of back then
[Chorus]
Well I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, held on
God knows, too long, you wasted my time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
No amount of freedom gets you clean
I still got you all over me

[Bridge]
I lived, and I learned, and found out what it was to turn around
And see that we were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I tried, and I watched a part of myself die
No amount of freedom, gets you clean
I still got you all over me
I still got you all over me

[Outro]
Na na na, na na na, Na na na, na na na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, all over me
Na na na, na na na, Na na na, na na na
Na na na, all over you, all over me
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah, oh oh oh yeah yeah
Oh oh oh all over me

[Verse 1]
One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, "Look up"
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Verse 2]
Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says "You're my best friend"
And you knew what it was, he is in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love

[Bridge]
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

[Breakdown]
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love



She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along



[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your boyfriend, he's upset
He's going off about something that you said
Cause he doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of bands he doesn't like
And he'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He wears jerseys, I wear t-shirts
He's team captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me!

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
"Hey, isn't this easy?"
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since he brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doin' with a dick like that?
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wear Toms and he wears sneakers
He's banging your friend underneath the bleachers
I'm dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus 2]
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

[Breakdown]
Why can't you just fucking see?
Why can't you just fucking see?
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
[Chorus 2]
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me

[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me[Verse 1]
Here I am, once again
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving
I should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing
You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head
So goodbye, it's not goodnight
Cause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
You got me, you do

[Verse 2]
In a daze, pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax, I go back to all the things you said
That only I know

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
You got me, you do
[Bridge]
I'm runnin' right out to my car
And I pull out the drive
It's only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
You got me, you doYou don't have to call me
And say you're sorry
I'm already gone

You don't have to call me
And break my heart
Each time i try movin on, oh

You don't have to call, Anymore
Oh, Yeah
You don't have to call baby

You don't have to call me
And say you're sorry
I'm already gone

You don't have to call me
And break my heart
Each time i try movin on, oh

You don't have to call, Anymore
Oh, Yeah

I'm already gone
You don't have to call me
And break my heart
Each time i try movin on, oh

You don't have to call, Anymore
Oh, Yeah
You don't have to call baby

[Verse 1]
You wake up
It's raining and it's Monday
Looks like one of those rough days
Time's up
You're late again, so get out the door
Sometimes you feel like running
Find a whole new life and jump in
Let go, get up and hit the dance-floor

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But when the lights go down, it's the ending of the show
And you're feeling like you got nowhere to go
Don't you know...

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say "goodbye", and you can say "hello"
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home

[Verse 2]
Your best friends, your little hometown
Are waiting up wherever you go now
You know that you can always turn around
'Cause this world is big and it's crazy
And this girl is thinking that maybe
This life is what some people dream about

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause when I'm feeling down and I am all alone
I've always got a place where I can go
'Cause I know...

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home

[Bridge]
Where they know exactly who you are
Back home, where the real you is the superstar
Back home, you know it's never too far away

[Breakdown]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home

[Outro]
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always, you'll always find your way
You'll always find your way (back home) back home



[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patron
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know

And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparin' all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

[Outro]
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

[Verse 1]
I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

[Chorus]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

[Verse 2]
If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one will be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
But for someone like you it's just so easy to do

[Chorus]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need

If that's what you need

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
(Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no)[Intro]
All this time, time, time...
All this time, time, time...

[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore

You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade so

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
(Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no)[Verse 1: You're Not Sorry]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore

But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no

[Verse 2: You're Not Sorry]
You're looking so innocent

You're not sorry, no

[Bridge: You're Not Sorry]
You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Pre-Chorus: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around]
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
I'm so confused about it 
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Won't you tell me, is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you go around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay, baby
'Cause in time you will find
[Chorus: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around]
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around 
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around

[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
[Outro: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around (Bridge)]
You spend your nights alone
And she never comes home
And when you call her up, all you get's a busy tone
And she's doing to you, what you did to me
A tale as old as time
Boy, you got what you deserved[Verse 1]
I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And I know that if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes will you be there?

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
And I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face

[Verse 2]
I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
And I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now I wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
And I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face
[Verse 3]
That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
And I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face

[Verse 1]
I ain't gettin' no younger
So boy, when I say love
I don't say it just to say love
I know better
If you never showed love
Don't think I woulda known love
Gotta put it in my song, love
And sing it over and over

[Pre-Chorus]
I told my mother that I love ya
My brother asked me where I met ya
Said I saw you last Tuesday
On the corner of 1st and Love
I heard ya, whistling my favorite song
When I saw ya that morning on the corner of 1st and Love

[Chorus]
Right there, right there, oh
And I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there, right there
On the corner of 1st and Love

[Verse 2]
My heart was beating like a bass drum
I heard Cupid in my ear
He said he never saw better
I gave him a straight shot
And it hit me like a moving truck
I howled like an animal
But it never felt so good

[Pre-Chorus]
I told my mother that I love ya
And Ray-J asked me where I met ya
Said I saw you last Tuesday
On the corner of 1st and Love
I heard ya, whistling my favorite song
When I saw ya that morning on the corner of 1st and Love

[Chorus]
Right there (Right there), right there (Right there, oh)
And I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there (Standing right there), right there
(Saw my baby right there)
On the corner of 1st and Love

[Bridge]
This ain't serendipity, no
I know that it's meant to be love
Don't feel like luck to me (Luck to me), no
Know that it had to be love

[Verse 3]
Like our names carved on a tree
The memories inside of me
Don't know how long forever is
Would you stay with me and find out with me?
Oh, if the sun don't rise for weeks
Baby, that's alright with me
I can't add to infinity
But if you stay with me, you can count on me, oh
[Chorus]
Right there (I saw him right there), right there, oh
(Saw him first and love when I saw my baby)
And I wanna sing it to the world (Oh, whoa)
He's right there (Right there), right there (Right there)
On the corner of 1st and love

[Outro]
I saw you by the street signs
Oh I, I saw you by the street signs
They read 1st and Love
Love, love, love

[Intro: Nas]
Crack fucked up the world
And I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era
Who made a lot of money off that shit
And I wonder if it fucked with they conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from

[Chorus: Tyler The Creator and Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Shit's getting warmer, on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother's a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you're accustomed what you're used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind
And it's all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent?
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up
It's my fault
You can, blame me, motherfucker
For killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger
All I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tucked
Didn't realize this game fucked, up some lives
Oh, how's mine?
My conscience eats it up all the time but, other than that I'm fine
I got a little money in my pocket

[Chorus: Tyler The Creator and Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop, I stole that truck
And I sold that dope, motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I'm sorry (Yeah)
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
Could have been an actor and won that Oscar, said I'm sorry
I sold that soul, and I killed black folk, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my mama all cool, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
I'm in too deep and I can't see the shore, I'm sorry

[Outro: Nas and Tyler, The Creator]
You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip (I'm sorry)
The, the, the, the transaction, the hustling (I'm sorry)
Even more than the money, it's just your job (I'm sorry)
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person (I'm sorry)
And to do this and do that
You become the go to guy, you know, forever
Next thing you know you're in too deep
Way too deep, it'll scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man
You know, dudes is buying choppers
Shoot down the people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other
Nobody wins, ya know what I mean?

Swag, swag times two

I don't cry cause I'm strong
I don't cry cause nothing lasts forever
I don't cry cause the kids are grown
I don't cry at all
I don't cry cause them days are gone
Ooh child, ooh child

But when the sun sets, just right, ooh I might
Shed a tear
And when the good word hits home
I'll shed a tear
I'll shed two tears

I won't cry in the car
I won't cry in the bathroom stall
I won't cry when I'm home alone
I won't cry at all
I won't cry cause them days are gone
Ooh child, ooh baby doll

But if the sun shines too beautiful, I might
I'll shed two tears
And when the good word hits home
I'll shed two more tears

Now that's four tears - you got enough?
No more tears, you've had enough
That's four tears

[Part I: 911]

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]

911 (You should call me, oh)
911 (Call me)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyonce
Can't see straight, these shades are Celine Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold-out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

[Bridge: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North and Tyler, The Creator]
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator and Anna of the North]
Call me

911, (you should call me)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...

[Part II: Mr. Lonely]

[Intro: ASAP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Lionel and Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

[Outro: Jasper]
Ohh! Damn! Damn!

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the reason we don't get down
So I'ma let you do the leading and follow you now
See, I just don't usually do this
But you're bringing me out
All the doubts I had have gone away
When you're touching me I'm not afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Knowing this ain't going away, here to stay
I just wanna be your girl
I can be all you want, will you stay?
I just wanna be your girl
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra
Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra
[Verse 2]
I didn't even see you coming
It was such a surprise
I wasn't expecting nothing
Now I'm lit up inside
Your bringing out all the colours
No more black and white
You won the race and got the gold
So here I am, we're good to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Knowing this ain't going away, here to stay
I just wanna be your girl
I can be all you want, will you stay?
I just wanna be your girl
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable

Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra

[Bridge]
I don't wanna take my time
I don't wanna wait in line
I just want you by my side
Come and gimme what I like
I don't wanna take my time
I don't wanna wait in line, no
I just want you by my side
Come and gimme what I like

[Chorus]
Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable

Cause you got my heart on lock

You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabraIn a certain way
'Cause you are beautiful and you are young
You deserve to have the best in life
In a certain way

[Verse 1]
She singing, "Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say"
I'm like, who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C
Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me?"
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
[Verse 2]
You said, "One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode"
Well, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me?
Don't you know you're my baby?
Don't you know you're my baby, ooh?
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

[Outro]
You'll live a better life
(A better life, young one, a better life, young one)
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speed, who cares what car you're driving?
No Benz can make you friends
She don't care what car I'm driving
And no Bentley can kiss me back
This song is dedicated to my '91 Acura
My 1991

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Yup, duplex in New Orleans east
I was writin' down everything
Things I would tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleepin' on my back, my body would wake up after me
My barber fresh out the penitentiary
That alcohol was stingin' me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
One was in the shower
My aunt in law come over to fuss and fight
So she get out in cutoffs and a wifebeater
Barefeet and bra-less, titties swingin'
She was seventeen then
Vaseline and Reebok classics
Weaves and baskets
Take the bully on the greenest grasses
His name was Renny, we was cool after
Matthew had some pairs of Air Maxes
Clarky had them road rashes
Lost the virgin on a air mattress
Texturizer, feelin' unnatural
This what I would do just to show you
That it's special now

[Outro: Frank Ocean, Sampha and Jazmine Sullivan]
What could I do to know you better than I do now?
What can I do to love you more than I do now?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do to show my love?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do? What can I do?



Verse 1:
I remember looking up
Almost choked and dropped my cup
There you were, style and grace
Glowing smile on your face

Beautiful inside and out, you
Helped me more, than i can count
I was all alone inside, you
Took me by the hand and cried

Post-Chorus:
"I fucking love you"
And, i know i did too

Verse 2:
But my emotions were so far away
My feelings trapped inside
Bottled up, always toxic
Always cowered, never showed it

Post-chorus:
Fuck my lame ass superstitious
Fuck my crippling inhibitions
Fuck my numbness, im searching for
The word

Chours:
Buried under there
Trying not to stare
Others don't compare
Are you even real?

And i know it's true
All i want is you
You you you you

Verse 3:
Im fine with all the broken pieces that thrown away from me
Im fine with all the broken memories that i got to keep it with me
Im fine that i need to stay away from you because i just want you happy
Im fine but i really needed you with me

Chours:
And i know it's true
All i want is you
You you you you
You

[Intro]
Peons got my blood boiling
Leave me be, I don't wanna talk to ya
In my business, knock it off, I ain't on you
You're in my way, now back off from me

[Verse 1]
Sleep with the sun out, I'm up with the moon
Workin' on music, I been makin' moves
They said the summer 'gone be like a movie
I say "How sway?" it ain't nothin' to do
Bein' productive, I can't touch a doobie
Puttin' in work, I got somethin' to lose
Leave all the fake shit not talking Adobe
We know that you ain't 'gone pull up and shoot

[Bridge]
(Shit I'll work out on my own
Shit I'll work out on my own
Shit I'll work out on my own-oh)
Sleep with the sun out, I'm up with the moon
(Know I gotta focus, Time is)
They said the summer 'gone be like a movie
(Gotta lock into- gotta lock in)
Puttin' in work, I got somethin' to lose
(Gotta catch some time alone-oh)
We know that you ain't 'gone pull up and shoot
(Yeah, oh-oh)

[Verse 2/Outro]
Bleach and dye, now I'm purple
Hit me up, I just come come and go
No De'Sean, runnin' outta time
Gotta focus, 'fore I'm outta line
Drop a dime, tryna reach me
I'm away, so leave a message
On a trip, can't get me
Psychadelic, DMT
(Time running low
I got to get shit together)

Glory
It's a sweet world
Always
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Always
It's a sweet world
It's so easy
And I'm not afraid
And I have no hurt
Always
She just walks the land
Grounds to an old war
And I'm acting like I'm never sure that it's...

It's a sweet world
May I have her hand?
I won't protect myself
If I find her close, I'll keep her
Always

We're nothing left and uneven
We're nothing left and uneven
We're nothing left and uneven

We're nothing left and uneven
We're nothing left and uneven
This is how I wanna feel
It's so easy
Not disappearing
I'm no guardian
But if we're here again
I'll be on your side
Of the glass
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Always

It's a sweet world
But who's housing it?
I can unstick these things
And I'll be glad to see them leave forever
And always
And I'll just walk the land
Grounds to an old war
And I'll be acting so sure
It's a sweet world

This is how I wanna feel
Always

It's a sweet world

A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Always2017, bruh

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
American love
American me
American you
American tears
American heartbreak
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I took a walk with the palm trees
As the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you (You)
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
M-R-S dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen (Oh)
In the fancy, fancy cursive (Oh)
Then turned her term papers in (Oh, oh)
A thesis on Islamic (Oh)
Virgin brides and arranged marriage (Ah, ah)
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know (Oh)
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far" (Oh)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
Well, you can have my Mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Oh, if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later, anyway
It's love made in the USA

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Don't let 'em front you, they sayin' you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be trippin' over some bitch-ass, dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You could get sensitive, but this shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
And nigga, if I did it, I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do

So, come along
Just me and you, and like, nature
Bring a life jacket
'Cause you're gonna need it
So go ahead, take a dip
The water's pretty deep

Oh, girl you blow my mind everytime that we're alone
Girl, let's do something new, baby tell me where you wanna go
So much opportunity, so many possibilities
I know when we be sexing cause you'll never know where we be sexing girl
I can't wait til you get off so I can put it on you
I've been thinking about you all day
You got that kind of love make a nigga wanna spend it on you
She ain't like them other girls, she ain't like them other girls
We be all up on the couch, we be all up on my dresser
We be all up in my bad, lil shorty ain't scared
We just do it anywhere..
In the backseat of my car, I know she don't mind
All up in your office, putting in that overtime
We just do it anywhere..Click pic for annotation

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I said niggas be takin' life too serious
I swear my music take lives - uh, period
Mellowhype, things are dependent-free mind-pyramids
Breaking walls down, never a Black Hawk Down, oh
They put a label on me but I see they're all clowns
That's why I talk English and think fast
Feel my words through the ink's last letter
Which'll never turn his back, back catcher, I grab
Extra magazines I'm in, to remind me of the places I've been
Returning to visit again, me and my fuckin' friends
Before I hit the stage I clench my microphone until my fist hurt
Before I eat sushi, I'd rather get to know the fish first
For all the cats behind my time, that rhyme - that shit's worth
Everything in my mental state now I'm secure, mental ways
Dental plates in my jaw for spitting raw just because
I like to floss my talent

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Think I'm-a wear the yellow tux at the Grammy's
And rock out with my cock out...
Like "who this kid think he is?"
It's just something I've seen Prince do
It's true...
No matter what, I'm showing up
Who gives a flying floating fuck
What people say, or think?
Cause end of the day, start of the day they all said we wouldn't get here anyway
You blink, and Wolf Gang's in this bitch...

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
When I was a kid I wanted to be just like you
(When I grew up, when I, when I, grew up)
Write my own rhymes, recite 'em a couple times
Hoping one day it blew up so me and my niggas could shine
I got 3 quarters and about 10 dimes
You can split them 10's up cause both these quarters are mine
Let's fuckin' celebrate, Wolf Gang confederate
We made it, we made it, we made it and you hatin'
Cause we made it and we made it
And that is not an understatement (oh!)
I put that on the people that I stay with
Live day to day with, tour bus is the slave ship
Niggas worked the grave shift, record clean up and play disc
We must be misbehaving
But the fans love it, they get the subject
Niggas claim be rappers but don't fulfil the substance
Fuckin rubbish, I'll dust quick
Nothing to fuck with, I've got my hands on my balls, like my nuts itch

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Think I'm-a wear the yellow tux at the Grammy's
And rock out with my cock out...
Like "who this kid think he is?"
It's just something I've seen Prince do
It's true...
No matter what, I'm showing up
Who gives a flying floating fuck
What people say, or think?
Cause end of the day, start of the day they all said we wouldn't get here anyway
You blink, and Wolf Gang's in this bitch...

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
I remember I first played Trick some OF shit
And he fronted on it like.. nah that shit will never work
Ha ha ha, like word?
Family: these 2 wrists of mine
I had to make them gold
You gotta let me shine...
If you're a friend of mine
Ask any friend of mine
I'll never block your glow, won't curb your high
We be, in a place they never been
Hellabands, for the hell of it
In Paris Paris Paris
White wings on desert sand
Flyin' over the Taliban... Probably
We be in a place they never been
Hellabands, for the hell of it
In Paris Paris Paris
White wings on desert sand
Flyin' over the Taliban... Probably

My aunt asked my moms if she won the lotto, where would she choose to live in the world. my moms said los angeles..my aunt asked me next.. i said africa. I didn't think about it a whole lot, it was just the first thing that came to mind. I've never been to africa but i know it's a big place.. so my answer wasn't really specific. It probably wasn't even honest. I don't know. I'm starting to think america's fucked. I actually started thinking that a while ago. I sense a lot of young americans feel this way too, there's good reason. honestly, i just live here. i'm an american, sure, but it's not really a choice i made for myself. if you gave me a map i could show you worse places to be born and better. but i was born here, i live here and it's chill here. so maybe if i hit the lotto, i'd stay in los angeles too.. pay the taxes and buy mom a house out here

Granted, i'll probably revise this after i see the world. but what if i don't?

[Verse 1]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

[Chorus]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Verse 2]
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about
[Chorus]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Bridge]
(Wait, waiting)
Let me know
You niggas goin' in
Tell me what it is (Fuck it)
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find, find a place for me

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, know
Love

[Outro]
Stay at your best baby
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1]
I was 16 when we first laid eyes
Scrawny little fucker, yeah, I was that guy
And you was down for the weekend
I was down for the greetings
And you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck
But it was my first official date so I was stuck, like
It was past curfew, and we was at the Grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something
All I remember was your motherfucking face

[Hook]
I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I'm floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag

[Verse 2]
You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I'm holding your hand and
Making eye contact I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses
I'm insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it
Cause holding your fingertips is golden
I fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and
Grip and keep holding on girl

[Hook]
As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I'm floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag

[Verse 3]
You got a nigga... Wait
Don't think this is going to work
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
I haven't talked to you in a couple of days
I got too comfortable
And started to think that we was really a couple
But hey, (fuck you) at least there was time spent
But by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant
But when you realize, its awkward, your name still my password
So I'm always fucking reminded
You got a nigga sprung

[Outro]
You're my girlfriend... You're my girl (Whether you like it or not!)
You're my girl... You're my girlfriend, you're my girl girlfriend (You know I like you a lot!)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl (Shit, I know that you not)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend
You're my girl.. oooo
You're my, you're my Girl
Ooooo girlfriend... girlfriend..
You're my girlfriend you're my girl girlfriend you're my girl
You're my girlfriend

Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked

Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Feels like I'm livin' a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag, you got a nigga sprung (Yeah)

[Intro]
The love glows, I know the love glows
Oh I know the love glows, I know the love glows
Yeah

[Verse 1]
If we colored our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bare hands
We can make light out of thin air
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well
Dreams feel realer than right now
But whatever you do don't let go
My only nightmare is waking up alone
In a world where you're not mine
And the room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That's why I never sleep with my back to you

[Chorus]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Verse 2]
Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of the bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart and your pillows
Whatever you do just don't go
Baby, the worst jail is
Waking up alone in a world where you're not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I'm looking in you eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you

[Chorus]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Bridge]
Like a nightlight
Like a teddy bear
Like a toddler's blanket
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children
Ooooooo, yeah

[Chorus]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Intro: Frank Ocean and Nikki Flores]

I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Verse 1]
Back packing your bags
Taking back jackets and giving back keys to your heart (uh)
Back tracking the past
Baby, it's bad, I can't take it back

[Pre-Chorus]
Aw baby I tried
I tried but I can't stop time
I tried but I won't rewind
I tried you know I tried (ooh)
(I) can't go back now I've learned
(I) can't use a bridge that's burned, burned, oh
Imagine if I could, imagine if I could

[Chorus]
I wish I could go back and undo
Start again, back witchu
Yeah, you didn't hear whatcha heard
Wish I could go back (go back)
And take back words

[Pre-Chorus]
Aw baby I tried (I tried)
I tried but I can't stop time
I tried but I won't rewind
I tried you know I tried (ooh)

Imagine if I could, imagine if I could

[Chorus]
I wish I could go back and undo
Start again, back witchu
Yeah, you didn't hear whatcha heard
Wish I could go back (go back)
And take back words (ooh)

[Bridge]
I wanna undo this fight (ooh)
I wanna turn down the screams
I wanna not make you leave
Wish I had hid your damn keys
I wanna undial the phone
I wanna uncuss you out
I wanna reverse your car and bring you right back to me
You need to let go of your grudge and I'll let mine go too
I need to be loving you

[Chorus]
Go back and undo (undo it now)
Start again, get back witchu (get back witchu)
And you didn't hear what you heard (didn't hear what you heard)
Wish I could go back (take back, words)
Go back and undo
Start again back with you (start again)
And you didn't hear what you heard (I wish you could still race back, ooh)

And take back all the words, all the words

[Outro]
(I wanna take back words-words
I wanna go back, boy, I wanna go back)
All the words, all the words
(I wanna take back words-words, I wanna go back)

Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?

[Chorus]
He said "Allahu akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion, ooh
This unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love

[Verse 2]
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one

[Chorus]
And you say "Allahu akbar"

"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion
Oh, unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no, ahh

[Outro]
It's a, it's a bad religion
To be in love with someone
Who could never love you
Oh-oh-oh, only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do

Girl can I hold your hand

Don't know where we going
Signs be showing so real
Why did God give me feelings
Forever ever I need you girl
(Kev Chino')

I memorized the wayward expressions
(Frank Ocean)

Girl your not alone

I'd like to stay a little while
(Frank Ocean)

Girl your not alone
You're my angel babe

I could fuck you all night long
From a memory alone
(Frank Ocean)

You're my beautiful...
(Kev Chino')

(Kev Chino' and Frank Ocean)

Don't go plastic on me

You're not dipped in gold
Dipped in gold
You can't breathe
If you're dipped in gold
(Frank Ocean)

Daydreaming holding your hand...
(Kev Chino')

You are not on paper
You are not a copy
(Kev Chino' and Frank Ocean)

You're so you're so
So thick so thick

[Verse 1]
My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing way too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out

[Pre-Hook]
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Soon as I enter
I put a hurting on it if I don't kill it she injured
For a long time, summer, spring, and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy-ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some 87 Locs
She's seen them hundred spokes and then that woman spoke
But I don't talk back, I put my life on tracks
If that don't work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax, it must be you
Cause I burn right through everything ya'll do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar AKA The Cash King
Quicker than pre-cum won't you give her a reason
To not meet up with me like a vegan
Psst, Goddamn I'm the fucking man
She said fuck her man, now she fuck with Mann

[Hook]
All the spoons in my kitchen
Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 2: Shawn Chrystopher]
Everytime I close my eyes I see a different dream
I pray to God that we don't close until we reach our dreams
College tuition for daughters that I ain't even father
Now I got a redbone at the altar call me Prince Akeem
Six digits for me to complete the offer
I used to call me Waldo, and now they call me Walter
Yeah, I'm higher than them Urkel pants
Live without a purpose, man but that just cause my circumstances
And I mean it, if you want it, come and get it, boy
Death come in threes and you're looking like triplets boys
In high school I climbed the roof so I could smoke my weed
The dealers knew that I was young and sold me bag of seeds
I'm chasing dreams, hoes chasing me
But I just get they name and number like the maitre d'
'cause all I wanna do was roll up hash and smash the ass of a bitch who live like Kim Kardashian

[Hook]
All the spoons in my kitchen
Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 3: Blessed]
She is the last straw, I've bend her then sip slow
My pencil draws her closer, she gets high and bends low
Long flight from my Cali mistress, to a district with red lights
Prostitutes and rich niggas, just a recipe for long nights
Shake well, and all they do
I'm laying next to some girl who last night showed me things I never knew
Either I'm bending space out or I'm just bending space in
I put my heart on tracks, but it's four AM and that chick's still racing
One bed, two girls, three way, four times
My shame came off with their clothes, it's paradise of the mind
Absolut vodka mixed with absolute freedom
I meet my darker side and it's a pleasure just to meet him
I'm thinking about puffing and writing while fucking
Yesterday's gone and tomorrow ain't comin'
And if tomorrow ain't comin' and that's the name that she told me
But when you hit this level, every first name is phony
But here, the air tastes better
Weed is more potent and girls seem wetter
Days are a haze and drinks just stronger
Nocturnal nigga, these nights seem longer
I'm only here for one night, it's Disneyland for man
White girls, blue kush, red lights, American in Amster...damn

[Intro]
No-huh-ho-no
No-huh-ho-no

Ohh, I got a love for my ink, it's like tear stains all over my diary pages
We wrote it together, and it tells all the secrets baby
But if this got into the hands, of those who stood against us
They'd try to develop an alternate ending for the tale

[Skit: Rosie Watson]
Many college students have gone to college
And gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else
Don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana
Because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye

Don't knock your earrings (Like yesterday)
They shined on me (We were little then)
In class daydreaming of you (My babe, wow, just a little love getting bigger)
You, wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
I think, it's gone out of control

How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah

Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it
Raf movin' slow like a creep
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailin'
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
Nobody

[Chorus]
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin' with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'... got...

[Verse 2]
Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo
Maybe the four wheel excitin' us mo'
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads (obstacles)
I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod
Savage is bikin', yeah

[Verse 3]
Transition lightning (ascending)
Ashes and remnants of ballers
Body that's gutted
A Bentley that used to be flawless
I'm high up, the raindrops keep falling
Scattered, the showers
Don't scaffold the towers
I'm up, mom, I promise
In class with the honors
No cheat like I'm honest
And how did I become so accomplished?
'cause I don't see foes
I just see a code
I just see a hole
Chinks in your armor
Like Pac in the Hummer
Like Jigga in summer
Left the house like Obama
Hit the road like a runner
Hit the road like Road Runner
I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking

[Chorus]
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin' with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'

[Outro]
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike

[Verse 1]
She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen on a skateboard
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos
She's thinking maybe the next one should have something to do with me, to do with me

[Pre-Hook]
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

[Verse 2]
Said you should get a rubix cube over your heart
But you say I've already figured it out
Already figured out the love
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip
Cause that's what she feel like she on when we on each other
Loving on each other, kissing on each other

[Pre-Hook]
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

[Bridge]
Paper to pen, needle to skin
I'm in the chair
And she's over there
Taking these pictures
And blowing me kisses
When I asked her to hold my hand
She told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
She told me that, told me that

[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

[Verse 1]
Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My soul glow with the low cut, no jheri curl, Jerry Rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, won't think twice
Your little baby bone boy killin' me
Swearing he's grown when he got that steel
But he ain't swam with that blue whale
I ain't swam with that ho neither, Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water, hope the monster don't wag his tail
And send that big wave over while I'm showin' off my pirate grill
To the baddies walkin' by me, showin' skin because it's nothing
My little brother servin' molly 'cause that bill due Monday
And my passport's buried and my home town flooded
With just a little bit of water, but my shoes still muddy
And if I ever have a daughter, I wonder what I could call her?
Nine months after I fuck on the beach, I guess I call her Karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat, I'm kiddin' but I'm ballin'
Just playin' but I'm serious, I'm witted and I'm wildin'

[Chorus]
This life goes on, man, that's one thing about it
This life goes on, dawg, that's one thing about it
I'm feelin' what you're sayin', you're tryin' to get around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it

[Verse 2]
Stuck in the sky, first time upside down on the whole ride
And I wasn't much into the type that my bros like
So I never really had no wife and that's alright
"Black woman ain't got no man," that's what she said to me
Yeah she did, that you can date outside your race, I mean
I ain't supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case, I mean
Somebody please switch my plates, ship my car to Rome
5k on the wheels, still ain't ridin' chrome
Backpack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal
So let irrelevant nigga do what irrelevant nigga feel
Let a regular nigga judge
Because his gavel fake and he regular, still
How that gravel taste? How you paid your medical bill?
Sands white on my tan feet, Colosseum in the back seat
Straw hut where the beach be
Like screen saver when your Mac sleep
Relaxing, I ain't racin' no fuckin' rats, I'm relaxing
And if it's wrong to ya

[Chorus]
Well, life goes on, brother, that's one thing about it
Life goes on, my nigga, one thing about it
I'm sayin' what you're seein', we tryin' to talk around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it

My boyfriend drives a lil bucket
When it rain it fills up with rain
My boyfriend he gon pick me up
Don't distract him at the wheel
In his lane
He's the only one

My boyfriend he misses me when I'm gone
So he don't forget me
There's a song he sings
Calms his nerve, endings
My boyfriend is friendly
And we don't want no problems

I could say that I'm happy
They let me and my boyfriend become married
I could say that I'm happy
But cross my heart I didn't notice
Hope to die no never, we voted
Me and my boyfriend cast our ballot
Every kiss reads like a poem
Making wrongs right like a poem

I couldn't say I dream of you
Because my dreams are filled with no one
And all is lost
Me and my boyfriend we found
We don't hope for beyonds at all
Me and my boyfriend spend time
And that's all I'm holding on
This time
We got permission
Nothing's above condition
But this ain't a thang
It's a mission

Can't join the band so sing along
Me and my boyfriend got it going on
Sleep with fans and t shirts on
Asleep in vans your legs all strewn
Across my lap
Tan lines where your watch was strapped
You took off to make time

Cut your hair
You left it so long
I love to stare
There's nothing wrong
And if I die while I'm asleep
I pray to God my boyfriend
Keeps my secret

[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face, yeah
Large crystals hang from your ears
Are they here
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind
Maybe I'm a fool
And maybe I should move
To settle, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
So what would you recommend I do?
I'm living in the city, yes
Forgetting there's a jungle outside
Nah
I'm living in an ideal
An idea from another man's mind (Mind)
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind
I'd rather go to jail
I'd rather try hell
Or I could be a fool
And settle, for a place with a nice view (nice view, nice view)
(For a place with a nice view)

[Hook]
I would do anything for you
Yes, I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I'd do anything for you....
(Anything, anything)

I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you
For you
For you

[Verse]
Still ain't have my float trip down your spine in so long, uh
Learning on the bitch, woo, get it
Search of the clique, woo, get it
Standing in the rave, woo, get it
Raise the flag and wave, woo

[Bridge]
Read something deep kill the pressure with the light
What I'm made of

[Verse 1]
If a tree fell in the forest
And no one was around to hear it
Baby, does it go boom?
Does it go boom?
If I have love for ya
But you were never close enough to feel it
Is my love any good?
Is my love any good?
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But the distance ain't even a room away
You're laying in the bed right next to me
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulder
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

[Chorus]
How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

[Verse 2]
I know you're somewhere in there
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiseling away, away
Chiseling away, away
Girl my phone bill is crazy
The rate is sky high when I call ya
But you only let it ring
You only let it ring, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But the distance ain't even a room away
You're laying in the bed right next to me
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

[Chorus]
And how do I stay in love with your rubbish
Shorty leftovers in garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel
[Bridge]
Stomp, stomp
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall
He don't hear a word I say at all
I'm wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk
Oh, stomp, stomp
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall and
He don't hear a word I said, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

[Chorus]
How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

[Verse 1]
Reminiscing on a younger love
Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus
Daddy told you that I was dangerous
But I couldn't stop hustling, even if he asked me
Fast forward now we're grown-ups
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush
Our future could've been different
But lets just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me
But you knew me well, you knew I had a love on a different scale
Heavy as the heavens, you could tell
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still
It takes a strong young man to survive out here
Carrying the pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
Used to have a backpack full of that work
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt
And the broken pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
It's getting heavier

[Verse 1: ASAP Rocky]
Young man, brotha brotha, you gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', gotta understand, gotta make the plays
Stick to it, get through, write yours, ride your wave, just keep it true
We'll fight the blues, we'll fight the blues
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha man, brotha man
You gotta fight for somethin', stand for somethin'
That's what the poem told me
It was a greater poet like you know it but
I'd rather talk about how my neck is frozen and I
I'd write a song about the banging hoes and then
Stay up in the bitches while she dozing

[Chorus: French Montana]
When I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"
Now we hop out the PJs posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', "Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (Come back) come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back) babe"

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky and Snoop Dogg]
Harlem nights, quick speed, Godspeed
Speed of light, Grease Lightnin', leather on my six-speed bike
Bicycle tires, icicle diamonds, popsicle stripes
Pop (Sicles) pop (Sicles) for the Klondikes
Pop-pop wheelies on the dirty bikes, 15 sellin' China white
Cops stoppin' if you opposite of white
Pop, pop like you opposite of right
Take heed, lil' nigga, lowkey, take lead on them niggas
[Bridge: ASAP Rocky and Frank Ocean]
Smooth dude riding 'round the boulevard
Back in the days was on the train
Ride the bus before I ride another nigga wave
Beautiful, the water's flat like asses pre-Onika (Yeah)
You the smaller version, you the baby sneaker

[Verse 3: ASAP Rocky]
Flacko, I wonder how it feel to live or be like you
Album number three and keep it G like Q
Heard you niggas get fly like G, like 2
Nah, more like 4, like 3, not 2
Shittin' on these niggas like P, like U
Drip Raheem and Q, got Hi-C like juice
Mama hubby got life, he got three strikes too
Real niggas bleed like me, like you
That's why I got a beam with a green light too
I don't even make a scene, I just swing right through
I'm just stayin' on my Qs and my Ps like soup
Walkin' in my shoes, follow me like suit

[Pre-Chorus: ASAP Rocky]
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha-brotha, gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', brotha understand, God don't make the plays
Take the truth, get through, ride your wave, just keep the truth

[Chorus: French Montana and Frank Ocean]
Remember when I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"
Now we hop out the PJs, posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', "Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (Come back) come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back) babe"

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
You're a cornstar, all you fuck is corn broads (You fucking pop)
Frenchie faux pas 'cause you ain't had no pa
Your deal got catches like an outfielder
(Are you, are you, are you?)
Getting that God's view from towers
Lookin' downward like I'm Donald Trump

[Intro]
Why do I love you, why do you do love me, we both distant from each other, but you stuck by me
Sugar sugar town, baby come around to my place, we need to work this out in about like... 10 minutes went to waste

[Chorus]
Drop down on the side yeah, baby wanna ride yeah

I cannot fit in your page, chapter too long I'm afraid to take up the most, (yeah yeah)

Life is just like a muzzle flash, hit you hard and it go too fast
Rumors spreading like who told you that? fuck the world man those the best, quotes, so depended on your soul and then
Coldest heart I cannot sew it back, (yeah yeah)

[bridge]

Female weather girl

In front of the camera
Morning and night
Letting me know when it pours or drizzle light
My confidence in you has reached its peak
One day will last me through the peak

I know you're such....

[Verse 1]
Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down
There's a couple things we need to talk about
Like when you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't goin' your way?
Can we talk about it without the shouting?

[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again

[Hook]
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause It won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, can't be the last time

[Verse 2]
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
For forgetting every little anniversary
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Got no way to explain it, but I know we can make it

[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, I don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again

You were just about to break up, and now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah)
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh woah

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Brand new, brand new, this new place I got to
New world, new sky that's so blue it's black too

Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold, see my breath visible

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah
Icy cold, it is so, it is so icy cold, yeah
Mixing the water with cheese is making the money get mold, yeah
Trying to be like gang, you better go get it in Vogue, yeah

We did it, we said it, we spoke ('Poke), yeah
We put it out, thought it was smoke, this 504, uh
This is at home, right down the street, from Alamo

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean and Travis Scott]
Moving in silence don't mean it's movin' slow
Even though the speed got old
Sprinkling methamphetamines on the leaves like the snow
Bet they soak
I'm a new species, tail swings on the road
Come to reach and lose both
Got springs like a toad
Some for free in the tote
Sake drown like round white diamonds, carats (Yah)
Copy sound, might got two wings, parrot (Alright)
Landing downwind, caught two wings (It's lit)
Talons scrape, hit the stage, two wings (Yah, yeah)

[Bridge: JAY-Z]
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Nigga with that Lisa, uh
Talkin' about that Lisa, nigga, with that Westside, nigga
With that Eastside, that dance, uh

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly
Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot
You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
'Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep

[Chorus: Frank Ocean and JAY-Z]
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem (Uh-huh, yeah)
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare (Yeah)
In my dreams, in my dreams (Ugh)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I sat down with Prince, eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy had "Slave" on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't "big bro" me, don't "Big Homie"
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams

[Post-Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I've been out of touch for a couple years
I've been ready for this for real
Hopin' I can touch what I see
'Cause I've been ready for you, for real

[Break]
Look, you've done enough
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?

[Outro: JAY-Z]
Eastside nigga with the feets high

My guy pretty like a girl

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Woah)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noe, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin' (Fightin')
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Pow)
Clips on clips like Mikey (Hello)
It's really all

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

[Outro]
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the "I Am" (Whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noe
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016, burnt some discs
2017, ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult not a clique, on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "Issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting (Fighting')

[Hook: Frank Ocean and ASAP Rocky]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld

[Verse 4: ASAP Rocky]
Our lives are factual and actual
Plus you natural and match well
Burdens on my back look like a shell
Purple act, I'm moving like a snail
Both sides even like equal
Both eyes gleaning like a scale
Green and blue, hundreds turning teal
Green and blue, money colored tales
Was such a good guy to Chanel
'Til she caught me sleeping with Charel
The Range, Royce, ring, like Pharrell
Bling so she see that I'm for real
Picture me, a fire burn in Hell
Photography like David LaChapelle
Black lapels and nappy ponytail
Make 'em call me Flacko Lagerfeld

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you

[Outro: Stevie Wonder]
Just like mine, they long to be close to you

[Verse]
If I'm honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
(Just like mine, versions of these belong to you)
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
(Just like me)
They long to be close to you

[Part I: Close To You]

I'll be honest
I wasn't devastated
But you could've
Held my hands through it baby
Let my mind
Run underneath warms jets, jet-jets

I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older baby
Don't have much longer baby

Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
But just like mine
Versions of these belong to you
And after a while
They're keeping me close to you

[Part II:  Never Can Say]

And that is why
I never can say goodbye, oh no no I
Never can say goodbye
Even though the pain and heartache seems to
Follow me wherever I go
Try to hide the feelings but they
Always seem to show
You say "Turn around you fool
You know I love you more and more"
Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye, no no no no no I
Never can say goodbye, ooh yeah yes
I never can say goodbye, no no no
I never can say goodbye, no
No no no no no
Never can, never, never can say, nev-nev-never can say
Never can say goodbye
No

I'm not so lyrical
Or memorable
Here's half a soul for half a soul

I'm intangible
Ethereal
Once seen
I'm an animal
And I'm caught in chains

I keep running around
Keep running round
Running round
Round round round round round, err
(Beep)

I've never been lyrical
Or memorable
Here's a half a soul for half a soul

I'm redactable
Expendable
Never been in the sun before
On a cold summers day
A cold summers day

The trees are lighting up
Down in Southern California
I can't seem to ignore them
And I'll never feel the change
But I can feel this chain
(Yeah, oh my gosh)

Im not so lyrical, ethereal
Here's half a soul for half a soul
In Southern California
Just thought I'd warn ya
I've never been outside before
On a cold summers day

I'm intangible
Alloyed gold
And once seen
I am an animal
And I sit through these long summer days
The shimmer is all just a haze (bring it down now)
(Bleep, beep)

Up here im cold, Memorable
Here's half my soul for half your soul

I'm ethereal
Alloyed gold
And I'm an animal
Never been told
On these cold summer days

Summer in the rays
On these cold summer days
Summer in the sunrays
Summer in the rays
On these cold summer days
Summer in the sunrays
Cold summer days

[I - Colossus}
[Verse]
Went to Six Flags, six fags came up
And said "Ayo! Can we get a pic?" I said no
And they said "Oh! It's Wolf Gang, "Yonkers", Goblin is my shit though"
Now I'm like, "fuck, I don't want to be an asshole"
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot (Tyler's here!)
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, "Hey, Tyler, can I...?"
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard "Radicals," the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song "Bastard" right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, "Fuck, is he speaking to me?"
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to "In Search Of..." and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like "fuck"
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a "hey" (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play "VCR"
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors..."
All right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
"Yonkers" and "Yonkers" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about "Yonkers"
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say "Sagan Lockhart" and when you came out to "Sandwitches"
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started"

[Outro]
Just take this fucking picture man, shit

[II - PartyIsntOver]

[Verse: Tyler The Creator]
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me

[III - Campfire]

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator]
Yeah, um
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting

[Interlude: Kids]
We're making s'mores by the campfire
Camp Flog Gnaw, Golf Wang summer

[Verse 2: Laetitia Sadier]
Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, but radical
Transformation, ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart

[Interlude: Tyler, the Creator]
Yo bring the bass back in
Yeah, haha
Who ate all the fuckin' chocolate?
Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha
Yeah
I ain't trying to go home, really

[IV - Bimmer]

[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator and (Frank Ocean)]
Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame Impala
(It'll get dark outside soon)
And I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You're fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don't know, I think you're chill
(Ride for)
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah


[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Mmmm it'll get dark outside, soon (My baby, ride for me)
Where the street lights trail (My baby, ride for me)
You ain't gotta lie to kick it darling
It's cool we're moving slow

[Bridge: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer, smash
You remind me of my bimmer

[Outro: Lionel]
Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
I got a can of these baked beans too

[Verse]
He came up in Dallas
Had no hazel in his eyes
Had them sailors on his thighs
When he's lit he show 'em
Kept it faded on the sides
We were seeing someone
We was dating on the side
He was seeing double
I was spinning hula
We were spending so much time
It was getting cooler
All this drillin' got the dick feelin' like a power tool
Finna move a nigga out his momma house now
That's a power move
That's what I gotta do, for real
Would that diamond shine for real?
Shine for real

Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go

[Verse 1]
You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved

[Hook]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

[Verse 2]
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

[Hook]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

[Bridge]
Crooked cop, dead cop
How much dope can you push to me?
Crooked cop, dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot, three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds (Sound)
Don't no one hear the shells (Shells)

[Outro]
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock
How you feeling, girl?
How's the gutter doing?
Crack rock

My sister called the other day and said she loved me, wassup?
I called her back and said I'm sorry I don't say it enough
See I don't put up a front, I just say what I want, nigga
Never let a nigga tell me I couldn't stunt, uh
Pro black but this twink white (white)
I'll sign if the ink right (right)
Two cribs, I can sleep twice (twice)
Niggas swear they woke but got crust in their eyes
They can't blink right (woo!)
These niggas fake confidence and fake show how they feel
Then go home and big cry because that acne is real
Show them scars motherfucker
How you think they gon' heal up?
Scab ass niggas fucking up all the deals
I got niggas tryna slander me, I knew from the start
But I can't do it back to them, it ain't no hate in my heart
Y'all Stephen Hawkings with the way that y'all make moves
But I'ma flip the channel on you niggas
Just stay tuned and watch em
I'm the real Fresh Prince, new crib in Bel Air
And I feel so free, the cheetah print in my hair (woo!)
Rainbow on the belt, gang shit yeah yeah
I hopped out that bitch, had to make some room for my furs
Niggas picking out their victims, hot potato, hot potato
Tryna' cancel me on Twitter, but got limits on ya' data
Tell the engineer to turn me all the way up on the faders
Because everything I'm dropping hot as fuck like clumsy waiters

[Verse 1]
It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
8 minutes ago it was all okay, yeah
I wish the year was just missing one day
I'm wishing I could forget it
'Cos it's still so hard to live with it

[Pre-Hook]
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

[Verse 2]
It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
Walking on 42nd tryna' clear my brain (no, oh)
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
So for 24 hours I'll been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space

[Pre-Hook]
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him

I keep praying that it won't exist no more

[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

[Bridge]
See I don't even wanna think about him
Or dream about him
Even just one day is one too long
There ain't no sense in bringing it up or bringing memory round
'Cause ain't no getting back the love is gone
I won't be crying no more no water will fall
The storm has passed and gone
And I wish amnesia would stay
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day

[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day

We were safe as the years flew by

If you could take two strangers
Leaning left and right
At a certain place and time
Like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives
And made us new
And took us through
And woke us up
I believe that no matter what
It can make us new
Take us through it
And wake us up again
What we had won't be the same now
But you will make something new
And it'll take you through this

If you can take two strangers
Leaning left and right
At a certain place and time
Like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives

And took us through
And woke us up
I believe no matter what
Take us through it

And what we had can't be the same now
But you will make something
And it'll take you through
It'll wake you up again

A live stream of my life
Is caused by this device
By this device
An internet Scheib
Ja, so ein grobes device
Das schafft einen stream of life

You better duck, run fast from the mania
Don't stare, don't laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya'
Don't let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up, and they'll shoot ya'
Face off, face off Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same law
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion
Watch em' close enough
Don't let the holster break or roast ya'
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon' switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner?
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!

You'd never have to be that rude
You wouldn't drag me down
Oh please don't leave me now

Thought those feelings were long gone
Said you'd see it through
And i stood next to you
Never thought you'd leave me, but now

You want to stay, do you?
Dont come running back
I thought we were done with that
You ain't ever been so rude
Leave me alone won't you

But i don't need you now
I thought you wouldn't believe me but now you
Said you want it back
You won't stop thinking bout that
Please don't leave me now
Oh please don't leave me now

You promised I would stop having nightmares
If I could do my best to just not believe

And that tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home

Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies

No, I won't put you out
'Cause what would this place be without my muse?
Nothing special

[Pre-Chorus]
Every book in here, I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of, some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote
Wish I could revise them, but there's no erasing
And the best advice I got was keep writing, yeah
And keep living, yeah
And keep loving
Oh, loving and living and loving

[Chorus]
And when the ink dries
And the pages turn to dust, so will we
Turn to dust, so will we
Dust, dust

[Verse 2]
Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library? Is that you?
No, I won't put you out
'Cause what would this place be without your smile?
Nothing special

[Pre-Chorus]
I fell in love with you, girl, oh-ooh
You let yourself inside, with no respect for privacy
You said, "There's too much on my mind"
Then you ripped out a page
And set that shit on flame, I quit writing
Oh-ooh, I kept living, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, ugh
I kept loving, ah, ah

[Chorus]
And when the ink dries
And the pages turn to dust, so will we
Turn to dust, so will we
Dust, dust

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Do you remember, that October night
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started
I thought that we were

[Pre Hook: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
I guess what we have doesn't matter

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
All I ever did was just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome, (t-tell me that I'm wrong)
But I thought we were

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter

[Hook: Frank Ocean and James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying
Fighting, every night
Dying
Fighting, every night

[Hook: Frank Ocean and James Fauntleroy]
You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
On the same side of the battle, oh....

I saw you, Chinese birthday
With a strawberry icee
Channeling Morrissey
Were we at the rave, dancing horribly
Pulse went through my face and my clear backpack
Sonic sound you made me
I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need
Hope you don't think I'm easy
What starts inside these hallways
Always comes and goes
I come from nothing
Like you come from nothing
Light like a laser cut from the navel
Til it's dark as a plum
Back where we're from
Don't take life so serious
If you find another
He could sleep right here
Between the two of us
I'll move over some
I hope he doesn't think I'm easy
Between the three of us
There's no one sleeping cold
Nobody said it would be easy
With you on my mind
I'm scared to think alone
Ohh why was it never this easy
The windows raise to show us
Daylight's come again

[Part I: End]

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

[Outro]
There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see

[Part II: Golden Girl]

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight
But I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night
But I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes)
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
I'mma stay right here, with you
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
'Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes)
I've found my gold

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Um, thanks for fuckin' with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl, I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green

[Outro]

[Skit]
Something is wrong -

I don't really have a dick in my ass

Even joking about it, that something is wrong. Is that what you're saying you want? Oh my Lord!

[character chuckles hysterrically]

Is that something you said you would like to experience? There's nothing funny about it

Nah, I really don't want a dick in my ass

I mean honestly. No, no, no, but why would you even be joking like that here at this place?

'Cause I was just playing

You don't do that -

But I wasn't even talking 'bout myself, I was talking 'bout somebody else. I was talking 'bout how this one gay dude act

Okay, but what was this when you-when you first came up? African music as well as an African market

Come on cuz, I'm-I'm hungry cuz

Hold on. What is the African market?

[Outro:]
You're listening to Blonded Radio

[Verse 1]
Hell yeah
A blind boy sees a green girl
She drives a green car through a dream world
She meets up with a green club
And talks of saving the earth from itself
A blind boy saw a blue man
Who rides a blue bus through a nightmare
He leaves word to a blue home
But the blue seems different since she's passed away

[Pre-Chorus]
And the same boy with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

[Verse 2]
A blind boy became a kind man
Who painted white lights on a canvas
He once said he didn't write songs
Cause making music would be selfish
And back then he saw the flags fly
Seen them fight and divide for it
He said war is for those who foresee it
But what good is border to me yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And the same man with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

[Bridge]
I said "I wish you could see the ocean"
He said "I wish you could see hope"
I said "have you ever seen the mountain?"
He said "no, but my faith could move those"
Ohhh woah
I said "I wish you could see the stars"
He told me I should see love
Love
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

[Skit: SebastiAn]
Oh, I was just telling that I got this, this girl before
And I was together since three years
And uh, I was not even cheating her or what
And Facebook arrived and, uh
She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it, because I was, like, in front of her
In front of her, and she told me, like, "Accept me on Facebook"
It was virtual, means no sense
So I say, "I'm in front of you
I don't need to accept you on Facebook"
She starting to be crazy
She thought that because I didn't accept her
She thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, "It's, it's over, I can't believe you"
I said, "Come on, you're crazy, because like, yeah
I'm in front of you, I'm every day, here in your house"
That's, it means, like, it's jealousy
Pure jealousy, for nothing
You know, virtual thing

[Intro]
This is how molly must feel
How molly must feel word
Molly must feel, word
Know what I mean
Know what I mean

[Verse 1]
Coming to you live, from California, California
We can drive half way across the stateside of California
Would you mind if I let the top down to feel the California
And all I see in the sky is sapphire blowing clouds of diamonds
Ive got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to do nothing to do
The beach is kind of average but the mushrooms are magic
When we've got nothing got nothing got nothing to do nothing to do
Im signing off the network I hope you're down to try to
There must be something something something to do

[Verse 2]
Coming to you
From California California
We can fly half way across the world now
From California
Would you mind if I let the top down to feel the California
And if you ask me why the birds sing then you know it's true
There's never nothing nothing nothing to do

[Intro]
(Really, though, I think)

[Verse]
Fertilizer
I'll take bullshit if that's all you got
Some fertilizer
Fertilizer

[Part 1: Fish]

[Verse 1]
Slip it in her drink, and in the blink of an eye
I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit
The judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link
Contended her to meet me at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fuckin' and we only met last week
We were both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
And it reeks on the sheet, girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie 'em and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go

[Chorus: Syd and Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh
(Yeah) Oh, oh (Wolf Gang)
(Wolf Haley) Oh, ohh (How you doin'?)
(All good?) Oh, oh (Cool)
(We cool?) Oh, ohh (I'm upset)

[Verse 2]
Bitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip
Make her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon
Busting Ottoman cannons, on the pill
Is he real? Gaza stripping (In my living room)
Wolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms (Mushrooms)
I'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon
This fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating

[Chorus: Syd and Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh
[Bridge: Frank Ocean and (Tyler, The Creator)]
(Frankie, Frankie)
Now I'd like to take this time of day
To thank the Mother Earth (Thank you Momma, thank you Momma, fish!)
Letting the sun shine down on the lake
While I fish your waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)
'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool
He on the loose, yeah (Yeah)

[Outro]
Got to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait
Wait 'til you see the semen swimming
Baby, please not half, the whole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion
Makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can't get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you
You're fucking wet, fish

[Part 2: Boppin' Bitch]

[Chorus]
So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin'

[Verse 1]
This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she's a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more Dora-looking sluts let me explore
Until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

[Chorus]
Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch (That's right), she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'

[Verse 2]
This little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn't feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

[Interlude]
Now, now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we can't fuck with this bitch, y'all? (That bitch she boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')

[Chorus]
Now I'm at a fuckin' clinic
'Cause my dick is swollen and keeps itchin'
Nigga, I'ma kill this bitch (She's a boppin' bitch)
Bitch (She a boppin' bitch)
She a boppin' bitch

[Outro]
Where's my gun? (She boppin') I'ma kill this bitch
Why am I gon' kill this bitch?
To all my niggas out there listenin', that bitch (She's boppin')
And don't let her suck your dick or you'll get hurt

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm hitchhiking love
Could you take me to the hills
I'm not heavy no, I promise
I heard you could fly, could you try

[Pre-Chorus]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
I'm spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Verse 2]
Oh I really ought to ask
If I need a parachute or something
Cause if you take me way up there
I'll be scared to death of falling

[Pre-Chorus]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
I'm spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Bridge]
Gravity's blowing up my phone, don't wanna answer
Them sidewalks calling to me (yeah)
Gravity's calling my phone, I can't answer
Ain't no service way up here girl
We're twenty-five thousand feet in the air baby
If love was sky, damn right I'm falling
Falling in love, but going up

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it, cause I see your wings
If that dress looks fabulous, don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Outro]
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me what
Show me what
Show me what

[Intro]

But listen here, I got some shit on my mind
I know its obvious that I'm the talk of the town
You seem to move fame or get the money bringing you down

I looked you in the eyes
I crossed my heart and hope to die
I will never let them cry
I held you in my arms
Said I won't let go until you feel you're ready
'Til you feel you're ready

Told me on the phone
Something bout you love me
Ooh baby say it to my face
I could have a place in your world
Kinda like your army, your air force, your peace corps

[Chorus]
So baby follow, follow, follow
Tell me where you want to go
Just keep your body close and don't let go
Follow, follow, follow
Baby let me be the guide
Just listen for the signs
And when I tell you right, left, switch it up
Imma take it slow, Imma take it slow, oh
Oh baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control, oh
Now baby look up at the star
If you wanna go, promise we can go, oh
You just gotta follow, follow, follow
You just gotta follow, follow, follow

[Verse Two]
Oh, baby if you like
We can go to paradise
Be back by the next sunrise
And no, I won't stay in Rome
I never go faster the limit, not unless you with it

And you told me on the phone
Said you wanna love me
Well baby tell me how it feels
Gotta have place in your world
Something like no other, your lover, your best friend, oh

[Chorus]
So baby follow, follow, follow

Down down down

It's for you, Forrest
Forrest Gump


[Verse: Frank Ocean]
The rings all ringed out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
We found out

[Verse 1]
I saw the train coming for me
With the force of a million marching
(Train coming in)
But I believe in us
(Train coming in)
I felt the eyes of so many
The whispers and shouts about
My belief in us
(Whispers I hear)
I believe in us
(Shouts in my ear)

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the cloaks on the judges
Flaws in the judgements
Beasts in the dungeon
That don't scare me
(Don't scare me, don't scare me)
And I'll say it on a mountain
Say it all in public
Hold a press conference
To speak about my freedom
My freedom

[Chorus]
Just us, Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us, Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us, I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us, Freedom!
Just us, Freedom!

[Verse 2]
I flew away this morning
What if I ran away and never came back
(I ran away and never come back)
And all of the fame means nothing
It's all a game and the gladiator just won't win
(its all a game, just a game)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I see cloaks on the judges
Flaws in the judgements
Beasts in the dungeon
Don't bring scared to me (no no)
(Don't scare me, don't scare me)
And I'll say it on a mountain
Say it out in public
Hold my head high
I'm a speak about my freedom
My freedom!!!

[Chorus]
Just us, Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us, Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us, I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us, Freedom!
Just us, Freedom!

[Bridge]
Free to run, on the water
Free to believe, free to love
Free to speak that mountain off the ground
I believe in us

[Chorus]
Just us, Looking upon a city of towers soaring
Just us, Standing our ground in a crowd of lions roaring
Just us, I won't be held, I won't back down no more
Just us, Freedom!
Just us, Freedom!

[Outro]
My Freedom
My Freedom
My Freedom
Freedom, freedom

I didn't think even think about this shit
But your bitch finna get a mink about this shit
You know what I'm saying I'm on Fifth and Broadway in this bitch
And now I'm at New York with my clip on my wrist
Yeah, nigga it's twelve on my wrist and twenty on my neck bitch

{Intro: Joseph Noah}
Sir, excuse me sir ay, um, would you like to check out my mixtape?

Excuse me ma'am, ma'am. How are you?
Would you like to check out my mixtape?
Well, at least y'all want to hear my music
Check it

{Verse 1}
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
It's two kids in the swimming pool
I'm not brave (I'm not brave)
Yeah

{Verse 2}
Just look into my life and understand all that I've seen
I been rejected from my friends and my family
I'm living on the edge and it feels like I'm lost and I'm losing my sanity
Just because I chose to chase an impossible dream, yeah
Check it I can't relate to my peers
The moment I'm unaccepted is the moment I fear
To outside the fringes places frigid and cold
Don't tell me how to fit in I'm too unique for your mold look
The outside, the fringe please don't call me your friend
You label me something else when you stop letting me in
The outside, the fringe this feels like home to me
'Cause being stuck on the inside means that you are not free
And they might tell you who to be
But love don't come from your acceptance in society
Fringe
(I'm not brave)
(Brave)

FUCK THE OPPOSITION.

I'M WINNING.

and EVEN WHEN I'M NOT WINNING, I'mma HAVE THESE AWESOME MEMORIES OF WINNING.

but i don't plan on ever not winning. so...yeah, i don't know what to tell these hoes.

[Intro]
Alright, hold on

[Verse 1]
If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day
And not skip a meal, I'm good
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour
Call my Momma like, "Momma
I ain't making minimum wage, Momma
I'm on, Momma, I'm on
Now  I'm making 400, 600, 800K, Momma
To stand on my feet, Momma
Play these songs, it's therapy, Momma
They paying me, Momma
I should be paying them
I should be paying y'all, honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me, Momma
Let me run this bitch
I'ma run it into the ground, Momma, the whole galaxy
God damn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you niggas
Fuck me if I hated on you

[Verse 2]
I'ma stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga, you got some just like me don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Family tree, throw a big shadow
(Jamming to the rhythm)
Tech company
Please gimme immortality
(It's a face to face)
I'm going rapidly, fading drastically
(Keep me high, Castrati)
(Punani fade the stress)
Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now
(Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway)
Smoke some'n
(Marks on that freeway)
They tryna find 2Pac, don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press, he escape the stress
La da da da da, la da da da da
La da da da da (la da da da da)

[Verse 3]
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena, they wanna murder a nigga
Murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cut bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my four door
I only got one four door
Remember when I had that Lexus, no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song so, I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Menage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas want fight in the streets
Now shit starting to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog this is chess now, not fetch
I ain't runnin' for a nigga, ain't ran since track meet
That's the only time I ran from a nigga
You could change this track now
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago
-know and -know, -know and -know
Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th though
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and Matt know
Shit went 180 on me, please run that back though
(Tucks til 24)

[Skit]
You say some shit about me?
Turn a real sport, my nigga
That second time Jerron was there, nigga
On God he grabbed me and then that nigga tried to pull me
Yeah, 'cause the nigga tried to boom me in my face
I had AD in a headlock, nigga, I had this nigga like-

Anybody else want to negotiate?

In the beginning I was humble
I don't give a fuck now
Any nigga say some shit
Automatic shutdown
A snap of my finger, I'll snap your femur
I know I a proper cleanup service that will drop by and cleanup
Blood and brains in the drapes, get vacuumed and steamed up
I'm married to the mob forever, baby no pre-nup
I'm talking big shit, yea, don't it sound good?
I call shots homie and I don't even run the hood
Think I was put on, I ain't even from no hood
Gangbanger don't bang, my gun do the same thing
Look good in red or blue, I never could choose between
That's really probably why I ain't never joined a gang
I'm too fashion savvy, indecisive, plus I'm happy
Fuck jail and I'm allergic to them hot shells
Grew up in it, tell you bout it like a bronx tale
I got a bone to pick, big as an ox tail
I got a sledgehammer for your answer
Blowtorch from my cigarettes yea
You think that is an overreaction
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun

I'm so damn suave, yea so damn hood
I'm coroner west coast, god damn a nigga good
Got a gun ain't had to use it yet, knock knock on wood
If I pop this big shit, it'll knock down redwoods
Wish a nigga would, no I don't. wish he wouldn't
'Cause if he do his brains is goo, homie, jello puddin'
I'm no killer, no terminator
But if you push me, I'mma make a great impersonator
These niggas ain't shit and ain't never gonna be shit
I'm on a yacht in c carters call me seasick
Blondes and brunettes, I feed them sea dick
A nigga get popped, I ain't see shit
Love will get you killed, I can't show no remorse
You rappers look like food, Aqua Team Hunger Force
So bon appetite, I'll pack a knife and a fork
A lot of rappers they eatin', cali and New York

I got a sledgehammer for your answer
Blowtorch from my cigarettes yea
You think that is an overreaction
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun
Wait till I get my gun

No, no, don't take your shirt off nigga we ain' fighting
Wait till I get this mo'fuckin gun
Nigga I have fun in jail

It's not that bad

Man I don't even care no more
A nigga stay high wherever I go
Either off weed, them pills, or some blow
Looking for the party. where the bitches? let's roll
I got my gun, my gun, if a nigga wanna start some shit
Mofucker don't run, don't run, cause I'mma kill you and your bitch

Whoa whoa wait a minute hold the phone
In no shape or form have I ever condoned
Killing somebody, him or his bitch
Unless he deserved it and she's an ugly ass bitch
I'm crucial, yea so crucial
But so's the whole world, best believe the feeling's mutual
Dog eat dog in Kathmandu
Fuck it, I'm gonna eat like man vs food

Nigga I'm senseless
I'm outta control nigga
If I get this gun nigga and you hear heads pop off
I'm popping niggas
I'm popping babies

Nigga I'm put a fucking nipple on the end of a silencer and put it in a baby's mouth

[Verse 1]
It's 2 am
Got a call
From a girl

She heard a noise
Got a little scared
Now you of all people know
She hates sleeping alone
But still you ain't home
So since you're nowhere to be found
Don't trip bro I'mma hold her down

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not hating
On your situation

For you to know what you really had
On the spotlight
But as soon as you drop the ball

[Bridge]
To be honest, I ain't perfect

And it ain't a pretty picture by no means
I could push up on her but that ain't me
I'm a just sit here and wait my turn

[Hook]
I'm your girlfriends best friend
Soon I'll be taking over
I'm your girlfriends best friend

[Verse 1]
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight
But I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards

[Chorus]
You're my golden girl
You're the one i've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey

[Verse 2]
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night
But I know I'm not going back home
I'm not going back home, no

[Chorus]
You're my golden girl
You're the one i've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (girl)
But the sky's never grey (never grey)

If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes)
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
I'mma stay right here, with you
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
Til the hurricane comes...

[Chorus]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k (girl)
But the sky's never grey (never grey)

[Outro]
Loving you, darling you
Won't be too easy
Thank god you seen me
I don't deserve a girl like you
I don't know what the hell to do
I just been quiet, here a few
Down on the bayou with the crew
With the crew...
With the crew...

[Verse 1]
Take my picture
Don't forget to frame it
Cause you'll miss me when I'm gone
I'll bet ya
You're gonna wanna hang it on the wall
Next to the door I walked out of

[Pre-Chorus]
(What now?)
That's the perfect spot for our love
(What now?)
Right by the door I walked out of
(What now?)
Just to remind you of what you lost
Everytime you walk out that door

[Chorus]
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
I'm good decoration

[Pre-Chorus]
The colors of your walls are depressing
The photo of me will brighten your place
You know it outta go
Right by the door that I walked out of
That's the perfect spot for our love
Right by the door I walked out of
Just to remind you of what you lost
Everytime you walk out that door

[Chorus]
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
I'm good decoration

[Verse 2]
Now you can fall in love with a picture of me
But it's not real
It's make believe
It'll be true
It'll never love you back like did
Back then

Ya Ya Ya

[Verse]
Here's to the good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
First time I'd ever saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
Here's when I realized you talk so much more than I do
Here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more than just some night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out

[Outro]
This nigga-all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you, nigga
He told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah-I ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that, my nigga, that shit... Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart
I don't even know how I feel about bi-

[Verse 1: Kent Money]
The same feelin' that you get when your troubles go away
I be giving you right here in a lyrical sort of way
It's my pleasure
Really you're all welcome
Couple taps on the chest for the niggas who all felt them
Live life nigga, that's what they all say
But you don't hear them ducking bullets in the hallway
Now that's life nigga
Open your eyes up
And stop frontin' on the team and disguise us
Fly music for all my people to ride to
Common rules and situations to grind through
Couple shots for niggas I never stuck with
A lot of praise for everybody I fucked with
Feelin' same reluctance towards them
I cause them
Everything but pain, they anticipating the reign of me
If you see it you can attain
But beware cause once you get it the feeling won't be the same, uh

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
It's only right
It's only right
It's only right, right, right (right)
They did me down bad but I'm good alright, right, right (right)
I swear this life is only meant for living high
I, I got to be right
I got to be right

[Verse 2: Kent Money]
Uh, you ain't believing a nigga
Why you coming around
What you perceive of a nigga, huh
Maybe cost a few diamonds bad bitches and a good time
I give these girls great dick and some good wine
You didn't get it when I said that I would do it
Tapping everything you feel
I've been through it, hurts don't it?
Throwing the worst on it
Feeling the curse so we smile for the moment
The pain, we postpone it
Hate niggas, it's a lot of those
Head of the class, the ain't shit honor role
You get a mouse and keys and a opinion
Snapping on the net, in person never offend them
Fall back you on that real life sucker shit
Bring it to my face if you a G, fuck a clique
And I ain't heated
Really homie? I'm chilling
I'm telling you the shit a nigga feeling, uh

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
It's only right
It's only right
It's only right, right, right
They did me down bad but I'm good alright, right, right (right)
I swear this life is only meant for living high (high)
I, I got to be right
I got to be right

[Verse 1]
Walked off the stage
In the middle of the show
I had to go, I had to see her, see her
I must be nuts, that's what they asked me
I may be, but oh I need her, need her
I need her yeah, she got my air

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh

[Verse 2]

My heartbeat loud as my sixers, sixers
Guys pull me over and then they ask me
If I know I'm breaking the law
I said yeah she got my air
And I'm running, I'm running low
Where my driver go? Man I don't care
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone

[Hook]
And try to be ready when I get there

[Bridge]
On my way, I'm coming

Traffic killing me, barely can groove but I coming, yeah I'm coming
Phone dead, can't talk to you right now
But I'm coming to get you, coming

You got what I what I, I, needed
Oh my baby

[Hook]
And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh

[Outro]

Got the keys so we're gone, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Got the keys so we're gone, oh

Got the keys so we're gone, oh

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm hitchhiking love
Could you take me to the hills
I'm not heavy no, I promise
I heard you could fly, could you try

[Pre-Chorus]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
I'm spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Verse 2]
Oh I really ought to ask
If I need a parachute or something
Cause if you take me way up there
I'll be scared to death of falling

[Pre-Chorus]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
I'm spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Every body knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Bridge]
Gravity's blowing up my phone, don't wanna answer
Them sidewalks calling to me (yeah)
Gravity's calling my phone, I can't answer
Ain't no service way up here girl
We're twenty-five thousand feet in the air baby
If love was sky, damn right I'm falling
Falling in love, but going up

[Chorus]
Don't try to hide it, cause I see your wings
If that dress looks fabulous, don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Every body knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Outro]
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me what
Show me what
Show me what

{sounds n other stuff}

[Verse 1]
I hated every time we go out
Got everybody complementing you
You love attention from a big crowd
Feels like I'm on the sideline
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
Who's this other guy, that's sending you these flowers
Oh, now you tell me, that your ex is your best friend

[Hook]
Call me crazy
But all I want is you
To myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous
But I just call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

[Verse 2]
The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn't cause of me
Who else could it be?
And why when your with your friends it's always movie night or girl's night
It feels like I'm riding the bench
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
On the dance floor you're showing off your best moves
You've see my blown fuse, 'cause everybody's on you

[Hook]
Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

[Bridge]
The only thing I wish is all that's in your heart
Though it seems like I'm nagging, oh
Is wanting only me too much to ask?

[Hook]
When all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love


[Verse 1]
Maybe I should just be clear
It sucks not having you here
There ain't a better way to say
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear
Like a bottle of Evian, you can see through me
My ego ain't here

[Pre-Chorus]
So many clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

[Verse 2]
I try to go some months without a call
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all
Maybe I could find something in the club
Or something in the mall, mall, mall
But them girls didn't matter
And this money ain't distracting me much at all
[Pre-Chorus]
I know some clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you

[Bridge]
Girl I wanted to cry
But I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To hold it in and save face
And it was harder to stay
So I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To just get up and walk away
Now I'm alone and the tears do fall
Open my mouth and the words do fall
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart

[Chorus]
The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

Never seen a cloud
(upclose baby)
Never left the ground

Never fucked the hundred miles up (uup)

Heartbreak plus jetlag
Heartbreak plus jetlag

But deep down im scared to drive back home
Cause last time it went up, it down, down down...
In flames

Heartbreak plus jetlag ooh..

Waiting at the terminal, waiting oh oh oh
I watched everybody else get on
But deep down I'm scared to fly back home
Cause last time it went up and went down, down, down
In flames

[Bridge]
But if I'd never met yo ass
I would never known how it feels to crash

[Hook]
We didn't land smooth, damn
It's heartbreak plus the jetlag
Ohh ohh oh
Heartbreak plus jetlag

What the Hell?

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
I ain't been home in a week
Barely been to Pasadena since them San Fran streets
I stay the night at the studio, I get no sleep
My passion for this music yo, it's far too deep
I rest for 3 hours a day, 4 and an half if I'm lucky
4:45 in the mornin' and I'm the only one up, see
I'm all about the hustle, Hodgy 'bout his grind
And you'll no longer struggle once you make up your mind
I had made up my mind and now I'm takin' the time
Steady niggas takin' from mines, I record in outer space
Bendin' time, lendin' rhymes, not a hand
Mixtapes to a fan, giving and gettin' grams
Odd Future shinin', S.P.F. sunscreen
Needs to be applied to burn from sunbeams
Teach a lesson if haven't learned from one's schemes
Mankind wouldn't be realistic if no one dreamed, yeah

[Chorus: Frank Ocean, Hodgy and Frank Ocean]
I got, I got anime on the screen
I got, I got pen in hand, scripting dreams
I got, I got - rich man said to me
"Just remember one thing: you'll never have time," time
You'll never have time, time
You'll never have time, time
You'll never have time, time

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
I knew it, mama, I knew it
One wish every birthday candle before I blew it
Son carved the paths out but I drew it, sicker than the flu
I'm on my stew shit, just let it simmer and brew
When I'm remembering you
We fall out in the winter
September, October, Novembering you
No contender with you, I'm like tendering food
Zip-Lock marinated, cook it if you care to take it
The time now to bake it, mama, show me how you make it
Bring me to life with an icing covered knife
Single handedly raised us, sacrifice and had to fight
For pay just to raise us, love is what made us today
Trust, we always got steel
I'll proceed to protect if I'm goin', shot, kill
I'm the star, twinkle, twinkle
Thanks for every birthday, you lit candles for cake, sprinkles, uh

[Chorus: Frank Ocean, Hodgy and Frank Ocean]
I got, I got anime on the screen
I got, I got pen in hand, scripting dreams
I got, I got - rich man said to me
"Just remember one thing: you'll never have time," time
You'll never have time, time
You'll never have time, time
You'll never have time, time

[Interlude: Left Brain]
Yo, yo, what the fuck is an interlude, anyway?
What the fuck is an interlude for, man?
What the hell do you need a fuckin' interlude for, man?
Fuck that, just play the next song

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
My flag is American, but I love some Queen
I'm young enough to vote, and toke the trees
I'll be playing concerts in the mud, until the sequel
I'll be finding subjects to paint in the buff, behind the easel
Tryna fuck, I'm a bad boy
I'm a punk, I'm a black man, I could dunk

[Pre-Hook]
And I'm hanging low, and I'm swinging far
Home, home

[Hook]
What you say
You need a hero
Heard 'em say
You need a save, hey

[Verse 2]
How high, tell me how high shall we jump
How far, really how far have we come
I've been wondering if we'd be better off without it
I was wondering were we better off before

[Outro]
Who needs you?, Who needs you?
Who loves you? Who doesn't?
What you say
You need a save, hey

[Verse 1]
Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self contained and aware
Of each other's forms
Still and in full strides just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

[Refrain]
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around the Higgs

[Verse 2]
What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video; only difference is, it's flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

[Bridge]
I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you've showed
What you give, my words can't hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours

[Outro]
Turn back, turn back
Turn back, turn
Back, turn back, turn
If you've never been in love
[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Gorgeous, chrome-plated horse whip
Home, making paintings for poor-quality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy
Sack swinging like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good Lord, walk light like the floor slick
Look bored, hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion, endorsing his own importance
Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating crisp spit
Fist clenched, emulating '68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle-age and limp-stick
Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliff's lit
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium
Heavy as insurance off a spanking new laser gun
Crazy heart, hazy lung, making art, raking funds
Crowd going dumb like Palin's son, ugh

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
And it always follows autumn
No home for the weak
No insurance for your pride
Jive
Jive
And it always follows autumn
[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I sit in thought 'til the flow is right
Then throw some D onto all available open mics
Smoke it right, proposing these niggas over
Wipe more because I normally toilet-bowl with a broken pipe
Shhh... The former soloist who flow was sick
The token sober kid stressed, so the role was switched
Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff
And who was useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit
Nigga, cold is what you need to keep the poultry in
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks
Early Man, you posers know me as the troll
Throwing moldy donut holes at your grody ho
From his cronies' whip
Eating like the kids when you take 'em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over tacks
Damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is
Missiles to the picket fence
Who spit as good as finger-lickin', bitch?
Bet it's 36 fish netted like the hook was inefficient

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
And it always follows autumn
No home for the weak
No insurance for your pride
Jive
Jive
And it always follows autumn

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, my
Oh, yeah yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, love, love, love
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Hollywood, Hollywood
Heard you like to take the love
That's why I came to town
With only my brain
Holly baby
Baby, yeah, baby, yeah
Why do you drive the talent crazy, crazy
Yeah

[Chorus]
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
And they come from far away to meet ya'
Then you break their hearts in pieces
They call you home
Their home, their home
Yeah, yeah
And you drive them crazy
Holly baby, Holly baby, Hollywood, oh

[Verse 2]
I met you on the TV screen
You told me you were single, and
We talked about the weather babe
You said it never rains in southern Cali
Baby, baby
Why do you drive the talent crazy
Yeah, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
When they call you home
Their home, their home, yeah
And they come from far away to meet ya
Then you break their hearts in pieces
They call you home
Their home, their home, yeah, yeah
And you drive them crazy
Holly baby, Holly baby, Hollywood
Oh yeah

[Verse]
Cityview turned to the mountain view
Find a place for a quiet one
Suburbia got a yard
All this estate for my mind to run
Run, run, run

[Verse 1]
What's the point of interacting?
If no one will talk to me?
And I'd rather have left be
And you all can go off with your money and weed

First let me find myself
So I can redefine myself
But I still might not come out
I'm not ready to shout

And be noticed
And make new moments
That I can cherish over
Being safe and sober

But if I put myself out
It might not be much
I won't lie
Like forever, I'd rather hide

[Chorus]
I can think better alone
Locked away in my home
I'm not respected either though
But I don't wanna if you should know

So goodbye for now
Maybe I'll wonder how
How I would've done without a frown
And instead with a crown

[Instrumental Change]

[Verse 2]
Stay away
I'm too afraid
To leave this cave
It's the only place

To stay away from doom
And nonstop gloom
And that cave is my bedroom
And no one better step a foot

[Chorus]
I can think better alone
Locked away in my home
I'm not respected either though
But I don't wanna if you should know

[Verse 1]
I got a question I wanna ask my momma
But she's been gone for some years now
I need the answers, I want to ask my friends
But they're to cool to be honest
And she's gone take it the wrong way if I question her
It just might break her heart, man
I can't ask my girl

[Hook]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie
And I'mma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
Am I in love?

[Verse 2]
Who the hell knows who Purple Rain is?
And am I standing in it?
I sing along to every single word though
And I feel like I need them
'Cause for all I know
Rocket love flew past me yesterday
But I gotta know for sure

[Hook]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie
And I'mma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
Am I in love?

She gone!
Ain't coming back
Like the keys to the lac
I used to see ya
I used to love ya
I used to kiss ya
I used to hug ya
Where'd ya go?!
I'll never know
I miss ya head down to the toe
I miss them kisses
I miss the fire

Tired out my my my mind
Lost all my money and my time
I used to be the best, now I do not grind
Shawty where'd ya go
I lost my mind
Tried to find ya
Tried to love ya
I miss ya food
When ya cook
Now you ain't never gonna, hear a reply again
She gone!

I used to hug ya
Where'd ya go?!

She gone forever
She was so flyy
Me and her
Her and I
Can I see you one more time
Before the day I die?
She asked me questions
I asked her "why?"
She said, "I love you"
No reply
I guess you can just spend it all on me
Me
But we could've been something special
Just know you always got a special place in my, in my, in my
I guess you can just spend it all on me
Me
But we could've been something special
Just know you always got a special place in my, in my, in my
She gone!

I miss them kisses

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Let the mother-fucking beat build in this bitch
About that

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you
Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you around

[Chorus: Beyonce]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
Why is that?

[Chorus: Beyonce]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

[Bridge: Beyonce]
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

[Chorus: Beyonce]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away (But you're away)
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

[Bridge: Beyonce]
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

[Verse 1]
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you, around

[Hook]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
If I got with you, would it feel the same

[Verse 2]
Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean them, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, now why is that?

[Hook]
Oh it's cause I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, I miss you insane
But if I got with you, would it feel the same

[Verse 3]
And it don't matter who you are
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything

[Part I: Impietas]

[Intro]
Are you against me or are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?

[Part II: Deathwish]

[Verse]
Is it a deathwish to doze off helpless?
Leave myself at the mercy of you
At the mercy, of you
And I be needing my sleep in peace
Need to trust you
At the mercy of you

[Breakdown]
You
At the, at the, at the
At the, yeah, at the
At the, at the the

[Verse 1:]
One winter morning I went for a drive, I stopped somewhere between June and July
I love these warmer days
But maybe I can't see that the snow's still falling
I only see the gift my heart just brought me
(Merry Christmas babe) That's what she said
She didn't have to do much, but she made me smile
December in Manhattan feels like South Beach now
I love my baby, ohh yes I do

[Hook:]
It ain't about you givin' anything, as long as you're my everything
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been givin me
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right here if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)

[Verse 2:]
It's just a regular morning, I'm a regular guy
Takin' the train to my 9 to 9
(But something's different today)
I had an envelope sittin' right next to my breakfast
And it's from my baby, not the bill collectors
(Happy Birthday Babay)
Then it said... I know we don't got much but baby we got us
And after you get off, we gon' make sweet love
Now go and get that cake (ohhh yeah)

[Hook:]
It ain't about you givin' anything, as long as you're my everything
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been givin me
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right here if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)

[Verse 3:]
One day the whole world will hear me sing
Then I'mma run and buy you those things
But right now, three months pay barely gets me a diamnond baby
But one day I'mma buy you that ring
Ohhhh

[Hook:]
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right there if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)

(Nothing but everything)
(I don't need anything, long as you're my everythinng)

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Every girl that I met on tour
I knew none of them would last
Cause it wouldn't work, nah it wouldn't work
A hundred chick contacts in my phone
About half of them I smashed
I put in work, oh, I put in work
But there's something missin' there though
Feels like I've gotta lambo with no gas to go
And I've got all the world, nothing to show
That girl just let me know

[Hook]
I need love
Yeah, I need you, yeah, I need you
I need love
Yeah, I need you, oh I need
I need love in the morning
In the afternoon
I need love all night, all night
I need love, need love, need love, need love
Need love

[Verse 2]
Two weeks ago
I would've never admit I had it bad, oh
I wouldn't do it, nah, no
Cause fifteen days ago
Never knew you, so never knew how this felt
Had no clue, I was too cool
But now I can't go a day without ya'
I wake up eating breakfast thinking 'bout ya'
We'll go around the world, don't ever go
No, don't ever leave me 'lone

[Hook]
I need love
Yeah, I need you, yeah, I need you
I need love
Yeah, I need you, oh I need
I need love in the morning
In the afternoon
I need love all night, all night
I need love, need love, need love, need love
Need love

[Bridge]
I wanna wake up from this dream
No sleep full of dreams, I'll stay
And I know it'll work girl
There's no where I'd rather be
Because I need

[Hook]
I need love
Yeah, I need you, yeah, I need you
I need love
Yeah, I need you, oh I need
I need love in the morning
In the afternoon
I need love all night, all night
I need love, need love, need love, need love
Need love

[Outro]
Baby in the night
Oh

[Verse: Frank Ocean and Jazmine Sullivan]
I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need someone out there
But try to love the one you're with tonight
Try to love the one you're with
Tonight late at night sometimes it helps
If you don't have to be all by yourself
In a moment life could end
And this could all be over with
I know you're in here somewhere
You came out alone
Something you need
It's been so long
Gotta find the one
Who'll hold you tight

[Outro: Lil Flip]
Feel what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)
Like 10, 10, 12, 11, 10, 6, aight?
Platinum

[Verse]
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket

[Bridge]
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
You make me violent

[Outro]
My room, my room, my room with me
Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead

Uhh, uh, what
I gotta leave you be, every night you iggin' me
Boy, baby, get your life right, baby, message me
And I hit you back, fast, Mackin', like in Tennessee
Off in my room, doin' what I ain't supposed to be
Wet sheets my sex be, I speak so messy
Babe pass me that death tree and let me smoke please
At night you be in my room, don't care what city
You dyin' to catch my seed, take off and reunite
Don't freak like you desperate, shout out your exes
They dealt with your selfish type of aggression
I beat then I flexed it, that's my confession
I skeet just to exit off to your best friend
Don't take this hard, me pretty boy, how I exit
You dread a thought, I made your heart an investment
We creep 'cause you pressed it, that ass a weapon
No sleep on that bed spread, you get this message
Now go on

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made
It usually doesn't rain in Southern California
Much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears
But boy they poor when

I'm thinkin bout you
No-no-no-no
I've been thinkin bout you
You know-know-know
I've been thinkin bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya

Or do ya not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin bout forever
Oh yeah
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin bout forever
Oh yeah

My mama called
Seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed
Ever since we was on
I dreamed it all
Ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin' say we changed
And look we made it
Yeah, we made it

I spy with my little eye
I spy-I spy with my little eye
Cause I've been thinkin bout you
You know-know-know
I've been thinking bout you
Now they always say congratulations

[Hook:]
Thought that I was dreamin'
When you said you loved me
Yes, it started from nothing
Had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
And it started from nothing
Oooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate you now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down, is good
You broke my heart last week
I'll probably feel better
But if we can still remember how you'd hold me
As you're screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good
It's all good, all good, all good
It's all good, all good
It's all good, all good, all good
It's all good, all good

[Verse 1:]
If I could see through walls
I could see you faking
If you could see my thoughts
You would see our faces
Safe in my rental
Like an armor truck
Nah, nah, we ain't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
I'll never be a kid again
We'd try to see if Heaven exists back then, back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Life was chill as fuck back then
We were friends...

[Hook:]

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing, oh
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then
Back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming, oh
I could dream all night
Dream all
I could drive all night
Drive all
I could dream all night
Dream all
I could drive all night
Drive all

[Outro]
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

[Bridge]
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Outro]
All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to? Mean to
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin', dreaming

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could guess your password
You know I'd break in
To the empty heart
That you keep my face in
Deleted scenes where I took off my shirt back then
You couldn't take off work back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
I had a twin
Took out all the mids back then
Back then
No matter what I did
I couldn't fucking sing back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends

[Chorus]
I know that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the mall in the nighttime
You came back alone with the flashlight
Had to admit, I couldn't see it ending well back then
You were dressed to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids at all
It's not the same
Sasquatch is over
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
We could start again with nothing new
I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Outro]
All those things I didn't need to say
That I said to you
There were things you didn't need to say
That's okay too
Baby, I could dream all night, dream all night
I could dream all night, dream all night
DreamI thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
I had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothing
Ohhhhh I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still down is good

*If I could guess your password, you know I'd break in
To the empty hall that you keep my face in
Deleted scenes, where I took off my shirt back then
We couldn't take our food back then.*

I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
*I had a twin
Took out all the mids back then
Back then
No matter what I did
I couldn't fucking sing back then.*
Everything sucked back then
We were friends

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
I had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothing
Ohhhhh I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still down is good
*In the moon, in the nighttime
You came back alone with the flashlight
Had to admit I couldn't see it ending well back then
You were dressed to kill back then.*

You ain't a kid no more
*We'll never be those kids at all.*
It's not the same
*The (hard part?) is over.*
Don't you remember?

Broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy, screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
I had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
*We could start again with nothing. *
Ohhhhh I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling's still down is good

All the things I didn't need to say *that I said to you
There were things you didn't need to say
That's okay too.*
*Baby
I could dream all night, dream all night
I could dream all night, dream all night
Dreammmmm...*

[Spoken Word: Will Toledo]
Thank you
Now, we're gonna do one more

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you loved me
The start of nothing, I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothing, ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still, deep down, is good

[Verse 1]
I catch z's at work now
So they're gonna fire me soon
But I've been dreamin' of our love
I wish my new day job was you

[Pre-Chorus]
But they say my checks come from the bank
And not your heart (not your heart)
And not your heart
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
And not my heart
And not my heart

[Chorus]
But if my job was only to love you, yeah
There wouldn't be no recession
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression
If my job was only to love you, girl
There wouldn't be no stressin'
Be no stressin', ain't no pressure
'Cause it pays way better babe
It pays way better baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
My boss works my nerves, girl
If you knew him you'd wanna quit too
I just know he's jealous
Cause he's lonely and I've got you
(But what I'mma do)

[Pre-Chorus]
But they say my checks come from the bank
And not your heart (not your heart)
And not your heart
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
And not my heart
And not my heart

[Chorus]
But if my job was only to love you, yeah
There wouldn't be no recession
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression
If my job was only to love you, girl

It pays way better baby, yeah

[Outro]
If I left this place today with the love that we made
I'd be paid for the rest of my life, rest of my life
I love you the rest of my life, oh
Be paid for the rest of my life
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh



saturday I'll wake up in central london
stretched out lil low on serotonin
cus last night was extra'd out
place both knees on the ground
then ask god what he's talking about
before i kiss him on the mouth
God himself breathed in and out
last night i had a dream
Gyllenhaal on a mountain top
holding on two stone tablets with ten commandments
and a flower crown power couple propaganda phamplet
black panther and white panther you could run the jungles sleeping free on the tree branches no light pollution
look how slow all the life is moving once you get your heart racing
today if i survive i'll let my feet leave the ground
levitations and revelations
take me up in your rapture now

[Verse 1]
Look up, look up, look up
You'll see the lies flying in the air
Reach out, reach out
Try to catch one if you can

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, right now they're flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
Causing kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Verse 2]
Feels like I'm on the 30th floor
Staring out my window
See them, they about to crash
Right into you
You're marching on the sidewalk
Umbrella up, oblivious
No clouds, shades on, no sun

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, right now they're flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Bridge]
Look up, look up
You better look all around, all around
Baby you better
Look up, look up, I know
They're coming down, coming down
They're coming down
Look up, you better look up
Look up, look up, look up, look up

[Chorus]
But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
Till you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Outro]
Look up, look up
And baby you'll see the light
You'll see him flying
Look up, look up
You'll see the lies
No, look up, look up
Flight 143 took off a minute ago
Flight 143 was just on the ground

[Intro]
Aye, listen
It's Lonny
Wait a sec
Okay, go

[Verse 1]
Hey let me tell you something
Don't be frontin' like he ever did it like I does it
Every time you wanna argue and stress
You always say you could've stayed with your ex
Well I guess you coulda'
But deep inside I know that you don't wish you woulda'
'Coz when you was with him
You was always checking for the kid
Late night coming to my crib

[Chorus]
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

[Verse 2]
So so so, tell, tell me, tell me something
You really think it'd be that easy just to let me go
I know I try to play it cool when we fuss
But truth be told, my heart would be crushed
(Cuz it's just for you)
I'm tryin to settle down
(Tell me who)
You know could make you smile
(Like I can do)
Tell me who, tell me who

[Chorus]
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
Like me, like me
I, I know that you'll never finda
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

[Bridge]
So, so, so
Baby I know
That without you I'd be broken down
But you'd feel the same
If I went away
Why can't you just say it?
Just say it! Just say it!
Forget it baby, it's cool
Cuz I already know

[Chorus]
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
Like me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

[Pre-Hook]
I'll cook your dinner
I'll even take out the trash
When your mind is cluttered
I throw it all in my bag
Baby, better yet I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you call my number
Lay it down on me

[Hook]
Yeah I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me
I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me

[Post-Hook]
Now baby I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you dial my number
Lay it down on me

[Verse 1]
You say you havin', car issues, license trouble
Vision gettin' pretty blurry 'cause your sight done doubled
Cause one eye so focused on your past and how your life was troubled
To the point where even if you meet a Mr. Right he'll suffer
One time for the independent women with children that's pickin' up with all they're baby daddy's slack
One time for the independent women that don't wanna be still dependent on piggying on they're baby daddy's back
But I know you ain't either
Even though you're curious I know you ain't eager
I know that's a positive 'cause you got no prerogative
You know I got a girl and you know I ain't gon' leave her
You think you my type? Oh I think I know yo' type though
I'm stereotypin' like a keyboard on a speaker
I never professed love unless I love a teacher
That was in college, I always liked 'em older
I guess that's why I fell in love with Queen Latifah
I like what I see in you
They tell you that you bein' mean, I say that you bein' you
Comin' from the same city where they ain't no bein' true
It could be discouragin' to a flower that's flourishin'
Gotta be full of yourself due to an ego that nobody's nourishin'
If we take a break we might hit a curb again
And take the risk of gettin' hurt again
If not this time it might not work again

[Pre-Hook]
I'll cook your dinner
I'll even take out the trash
When your mind is cluttered
I throw it all in my bag
Baby, better yet I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you call my number
Lay it down on me

[Hook]
Yeah I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me
I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me

[Post-Hook]
Now baby I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you dial my number
Lay it down on me

[Verse 2]
I love the girl that I was fuckin' over
I hate the girl that I was over-fuckin'
'Cause now it's nothin' but an old discussion
Almost forgot about it, so it wasn't
I'm way too focused on openin' new doors to get the heat out like an open oven
It's okay to toot your own horn if it's no 'percussion
But I ain't marchin' with a wedding band
She the type to meet a new nigga with a wedding plan
Your mind is cluttered, I would swoop you off your feet
But I got feelings on the shelf, and I hardly keep it neat
But I always think fun, so there's a party every week
And that's where I throw it
I sit on my watches, I'm on my own time
And you're never at the party 'cause you're never on my mind
I guess some things get better over time
But no more time mean to play your time's out
I don't wanna wait or stay to find out
Fuck this chat, I'm leavin' the room, I'm signed out
Then I ate her inside right after we dined out
Every time she comes, I arrive
My dick swings like it comes with monkey bars and a slide
And she slept over 'til the next mornin'
The other cried on my shoulder had the next mournin'
Last night was a movie so I kept scorin'
Now she's addicted guess my "no" was the best warnin'

[Pre-Hook]
I'll cook your dinner
I'll even take out the trash
When your mind is cluttered
I throw it all in my bag
Baby, better yet I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you call my number
Lay it down on me

[Hook]
Yeah I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me
I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me

[Post-Hook]
Now baby I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you dial my number
Lay it down on me

Yeah it's that lemonade
First Class yeah you know this is The Cook Up lets get it
O.K. I'm spitting these abortion bars all up on this lemonade
Got these other rappers really wishing they were never made
I'm always in the game these niggas never played
My gears always fucking sharp like I'm wearing blades
I only spit just so that I can get paid while these mothafuckas do it so they can get laid
I've been have these chicks open. Marcus Colston
Grabbing for my dick like a rebound. Postin
I got two bad chicks I call it double trouble and they both 10s that's a double-double
They got fat asses that's a double bubble
When they playing with my balls that's a double juggle
I'm serving up these bars call me the bartender
They say I should sell my rhymes but I'm not a bar vender
Man I just keep goin (goin) call me a machine
One of Octobers own but this ain't Halloween
I'm a punck line maniac this is my routine
The way I cook up all these bars you would think it's a cuisine
I'm not an undergroung artist more like a submarine
Got these mothafuckas bouncing kind of like a trampoline
I'm from that east coast, east side, EA we live we fly G5
Smoking up we high
Got your girl wet so I'm going in deep dive
The reason why all these schools buzzing. Beehive
Every where I go I always got my back pack
And girls ask me if I want to hit Black Jack
I'm made of money call me a casino
Make the haters sick to their stomach I should give them a beano
And I'm dangerous Scarface kind of like Pacino
When you see me call 911 Reno
Got a chip on my shoulder but I don't mean Doritos
And these niggas all beans it's a wrap burritos
I'm eight bars from greatness
The haters can't take it
The head above the shoulders I just see them shaking
Look I'm kind of gas I really can't fake it (no)
'cus if the right gears here my shit I'mma make it (Imma blowing up)
Yup man I know I'm gonna be blowing up and when that time comes I'mma drinking till I'm trowing up
In the club sipping bottle after bottle seeing 20/20 nigga I an't got them beer goggles
Chicks grinding on my slow moving like a snail man
And they open up for my delivery. Mail man
Look I got this on lot like a gel man
You think I'm being funny like Doug. Quell man
Dog I'm so serious
(not really)

[Verse 1]
My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light
Are you ready to go? We gon' be waitin' in line
Yeah, you look good, would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that, almost
Back home with that, next time
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
Freeway

[Chorus]
Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me (smiles on me)
I feel their smiles on me (smile on me)
I feel their smiles on me (lens on me right now)
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah (Know I got some sins on me)
Then get the scream mask for the vert rides (ridin')
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizin' (got some sins on me)
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college
This thing won't last unless we're both lyin' (both lyin')
Fake flowers, no water needed
Real life drowned by the weekend
No "whens", call it timeless
No ends 'cause you're timeless

[Chorus]
Despite our history, yeah
Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me (all this life)
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me (on me, on me, on me)
I feel their smiles on me
I feel their smiles on me

My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"

Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light

Yeah you look good, would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that, almost
Back home with that, next time
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley (Come on!)
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
Freeway

This thing won't last unless we're both lyin' (Both lyin')

Real life drowned by the weekend
No wins, call it timeless
No ends 'cause you're timeless (Timeless!)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I don't know if I ever told you this before, before
But you're the only one I ever waited for this long
And now the room is crowded, right now
So tell me are you about it, right now?

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
I've been thinking of you all the time
There's been various issues, but would you let me, let me tonight?

[Verse 2: Kyle Christopher]
Got all them couples floating on your pink champagne
You know there's bottle service, bottle service, babe
Long as the DJ's playing all these raunchy songs
Girl, we can do this on the dancefloor all night long
Now I know the room is crowded, right now
But tell me are you about it right now?

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
I've been thinking of you all the time
There's various issues, but would you let me, let me tonight?
See, I've been dreaming of you in the daytime
And it ain't right, so would you let me, let me tonight?

Now listen, don't you get this twisted girl
If I leave you, without you, I miss you girl
And if I had you right now, I wouldn't change a thing
You tell me this ain't what you're used to
But baby can't no man judge you
I can tell ain't no man loving you
I can tell ain't no man loving youLet me start by saying I feel like an asshole right now, but a tough decision had to be made in regard to my schedule over the next few months. The casualties of that decision include my appearances at upcoming festivals in Europe and my opening slot on the European leg of the Coldplay world tour. Sorry as fuck, I'll be back if you'll have me

[Verse 1]
Donald Trump said buy an apartment with her (uh)
Buying an apartment with ya
Greenspan said the rate was good
My pastor says that your faith is major
Best friend said I ought to wife you today
Like jumping over the broom
The white dress and all, yup the rice and all

[Pre-Chorus]
They said you love that girl
You need that girl
But don't you let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who going solo baby?
I know, you told 'em baby
Watch you, you tell 'em baby
It's cool, it's cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That's the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know them lights will never turn off
But it's cool
Cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool

[Verse 2]
Your father really likes me
He calls me son
Your brother, I think he hates me
But you say thats how you know it's right
Your mother invites me to dinner
All of the time
Only thing she's been grilling is me

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep telling her I love that girl
I need that girl
I won't let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who goin' solo baby?
I know, you told em baby
Watch you, you tell em baby
It's cool, it's cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That's the reason why I kept this love in the dark

That's the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off

[Bridge]
It's strobing, baby, and they burning baby
But don't worry baby, just stay close to me
They flashing, it's like dynamite
This love will keep us about 55 degrees
Don't mind the lights
Don't mind the lights
The love is gonna keep us cool
The love is gonna keep us cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That's the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off
But the lights is gonna be on us
That's the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off

Cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool

I'm the real livin' evil, I speak on the devil's nameliving. it's a plain difference from dead. seen a dead body this afternoon. the people who felt they had that body in their lives, have to let it go. the memories of the life that used that body are just as finite as the bodies of those who remember him. the woman or man that enjoyed that mans body, will only have the thin almost holographic recollections for as long as they live. then again, who knows how long we live, and if life goes on after these heartbeats stop. who knows where life went when it left that body. who knows if it went anywhere, not you. matters of faith, are matters of faith and faith is not knowing. what i know is that when i see a body without life, i feel sort of childish. a kid in a big complicated existence. a game with no rules and no point of winning other than for the sport of it. like the things i know and have learned mean nothing really. a feeling of confusion about the point. a bone chilling awareness of my mortality. still i wanna live. live and bring other lives into this world to live and die as well. some would say we are one consciousness divided. i would say we'll find out. but we do not know that. eh. life. where's my fuckin lighter.

[Verse 1]
I hear the rain drops
Fall on my rag top
And come down the windshield of my car
Parked on the same lane
We came to get away
And trade our kisses after dark

[Pre Chorus:]
You were everything I wanted
Everything I thought I needed
When you said that you were leaving
You got my heart in a vault
You were the only one with a key
And I couldn't get free

[Chorus:]
Still locked in love
So locked in love
In love alone
My baby's gone
I'm locked in love (In love)
So locked in love (In love)
And I gotta get free

[Verse 2]
I feel the clouds start to form
In my mind but
Rain starts to pour, then blurs my eyes
Maybe there's one whose heart is worth more to you
Than the one you left behind
By throwing my quarters out into the water
I wish that you'd meet me here like you used to
A heart in a mind we shared
How could you take your half
I don't know, but it will never be the same

[Pre Chorus]
You were everything I wanted
Everything I thought I needed
When you said that you were leaving
You got my heart in a vault
You were the only one with a key
And I couldn't get free

[Chorus:]
Still locked in love
So locked in love
In love alone
My baby's gone
I'm locked in love (In love)
So locked in love (In love)
And I gotta get free, oh

[Bridge]
My baby's gone (My baby's gone)
The vault is closed (Is closed)
My heart is cold
And still all alone
Sometimes I hear my (Hear my)
My own heart beating, beating, beating
Against the wall

[Chorus:]
Still locked in love
So locked in love (So locked in love)
In love alone
My baby's gone
I'm locked in love (In love)
So locked in love (In love)
And I gotta get free, oh (Gotta get free)
(I'm locked in love) Still locked in love
So locked in love
In love alone my baby's gone
I'm locked in love (Oh baby)
So locked in love (Oh baby)
And I gotta get free

[Outro]
My hearts pleading, so free me
Won't you set me free?
My hearts pleading, so free me
Won't you set me free

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh baby
I know I've been gone
I know it's been so long
And girl I hope you missed me
Cause you know I've been missing ya baby, missing my baby
Yeah we talk on the phone everyday
But that just don't do it for me
I need you around me
I can't do without you
Shawty, my plane just now touched down
I'mma send a car to come get you from your house
So be ready in a hour
Just be ready

[Hook]
We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love, we'll be making, oh
Just tell me
(You ready, ready?)

[Verse 2]
Open up the door
Girl you got me throwed off
Cause whenever you kiss me, girl
Can you feel my heart beatin', oh
Look into your eyes, pretty waves of brown
If you only knew what I'm thinking about
But now you're right here, oh
And now it's so real
Shorty my plane leaves at nine A.M tomorrow
But between then and now we can go far
Oh

[Hook]
We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in a while

We still got moonlight

Ayo, we got one

Oh baby, I'mma take it slow
I don't wanna let you go, never let go
Oh, I know you been patient
Been waiting for this moment
Right here, right now

[Hook]
We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in a while

We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now

Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love, we'll be making, oh
Just tell me

Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl

I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong (Ain't nothing wrong) with a lie (Ooh)
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
With another short plane ride (Ain't nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

[Verse 1]
Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
That's the moment that I see her as she leaving
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in
(No I don't wanna) but I gotta answer this call
Could you wait, it really won't be long?
(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone

[Pre-Chorus]
How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
Oh

(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone

[Pre-Chorus]
How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
Oh

[Chorus]
I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?)
She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
(No I don't wanna)
(And then the kid came)

[Pre-Chorus]
How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
Oh

[Chorus]
I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A

(And where she go?)
She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

[Bridge]
Oh Angel, tell me what am I to do?
Angel, I can't find another you
Angel search downtown, now I'm on the 10 West
Doing 90 tryna' get to you
Exit La Cienega, I'm looking, I'm searching
La Brea, Santa Monica, Sunset, Sepulveda
Robertson, Melrose and Hollywood
[Chorus]
I lost my Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
I'm posting pictures of her

Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

[Verse 1]
Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for my girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on you girl
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

[Chorus]
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Bridge]
She's at a stove
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong)
With a lie (Ooh)
Nothing wrong
With another short plane ride
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

[Chorus]
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Crazy
I plead insanity
Crazy for you, baby
Crazy, na, na

[Verse 1]
Talk to me
And I better not hear a word
Oh, do me baby
Ooh, I better not feel it, girl
Baby, I, I still got one bullet left
In my nine
Finna do a love crime, love crime
Finna do a love crime

[Chorus]
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes

[Verse 2]
You write me love letters
With your father's pen, oh
If he knew the freaky, freaky things
That you write with it, oh
Is it really wrong that I want
To be the baby daddy?
Is that a love crime, love crime?
Tell me it's a love crime
[Chorus]
Eh, murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Oh, yeah, yeah
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
In the getaway car
You know I love it when the ride is smooth
If we ever get caught
It'd be a long vacation for two

[Chorus]
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes

[Outro]
"Millions of years of evolution, right? Right!? Men have to stick it in every place they can, but for women- women, it is just about security, and commitment, and- ah, whatever the fuck else! If you men only knew. But you're not the jealous type, are you? You've never been jealous about me, have you? And why haven't you ever been jealous about me!? You are very, very sure of yourself, aren't you?"

[Verse 1: Mann]
I, woke up and rolled up out the bed feeling like a king
My reality rare, I'm living like a dream
The world is unaware of the type of change I could bring to it
Who you know went through my struggle and this type of pain
It's only trouble after I bubble on top of things
I'm not the type of rapper who chase after guap and chains
Bro I do it 'cause I know my swag can stop a train
Just a young, wild nigga, Waka Flocka Flame
Follow me, as I ever so properly
Begin to break down this whole birthday philosophy
Honestly if you not part of the movement
I do not need you to figure have to offer me two cents
Man who's this? I surprise my damn self
My mom showed 'em she did it without a man's help
So God bless us with a present like everyday
So in her case e'ry day is her birthday
Get it? That's the message I deliver
Chasing dreams, tryna make figures as big as Jigga's
And you can hide the brick nigga, put the guns away
Follow me and it'll probably be

[Chorus: Frank Ocean (as Lonny Breaux)]
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay, a lovely day

[Verse 2: Mann]
Look, I'm not just your average Joe
And this is not just your average flow
This is something magical
Cali home-grown, extra potent homie, that's fo' sho'
And if you didn't now you know
This is everything I practiced for
Showtime, 'bout to make an impact in yo' life
The young graduate of '09
I'm more than just swag and dope rhymes
Or walking fashion show lines
My aura of [?] is gone shine
Like the sun during the day time
Yeah they was hot during they time, it's our turn
Do you not see me? I'm a star sir
Fresh off the plane looking for car service
I just landed in my dreams and I'm 'bout to go sightseeing

[Chorus: Frank Ocean (as Lonny Breaux)]
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay, a lovely day

[Verse 3: Mann]
BDB established at the Grand Lux
Tryna find a perfect name to brand us
Had to identify the type of name I wanna push
And then the birthday mojo came through in the clutch
BDB, I was like, "it stand for what?"
Birthday Boys bro, in the cake we trust
Everyday our B-day, everyday we fresh
And everyday we celebrate, celebrate with us
That's why your girl leave you to come hang with us
What y'all be trippin' off [?], ain't a thang to us
Livin' life, everything is plush
And when she were here mayne, it ain't a rush
When she roll with a B-day boy, feeling dangerous
And the kush grade A
Behind my back they hate us
But in my face they hush, they sus'
Sleepin' on Mann, nigga, wake up

[Chorus: Frank Ocean (as Lonny Breaux)]
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay
A lovely day-day, day-day, oh-oh
Lovely day, lovely day-ay-ay, a lovely day
A lovely day
A lovely day

And He'll bring you out the, out the darkness

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said, "You going to school, I'll give you a summer"
Then she met No I.D. and gave me his number
Ten years later, she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
And I'm rapping on the beats they was supposed to buy
I guess I'm getting high off my own supply
Downtown, mixing fabrics, tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folks'll tell you not to play in traffic, uh
A million hits and the web crashes, damn
South Park had 'em all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin', uh
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain't no fashion show, mothafucka, we live it

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I pledge allegiance to my Grandma
For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm and Hammer
Straight out the kitchen, shh, don't wake Nana
Built a republic that still stands
I'm tryna lead a nation to leave to my little man's
Or my daughter, so I'm boiling this water
The scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order
Hold up, here comes grandma, what's up Yaya?
What's that smell? Oh, I'm just boiling some agua
No papa, bad Santa
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
I got my liberty chopping grams up
Street justice, I pray God understand us
I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
This is the Star Spangled Banner

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Yes, we did

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Yes, we did

[Verse 1]
Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles 'til I'm at the greyhound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinking 'bout what my mother would say
As I'm singing an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

[Verse 2]
So I turn around and headed to the old run-down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back
I watch the upper-classmen drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them
Still haven't got over it yet
It's been playing in my ears all morning I swear
My iPod's the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

[Bridge]
Never get mad enough to walkout
If I do then I won't be gone for long
Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what I'll love her just the same
That's my mama, yeah
So no matter what I ain't leaving unless she's coming soon

[Chorus]
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

[Verse 1]
Girl when I met you
The numbers were runnin' through my head
I coulda wrote down your number
But I memorized them instead, ooh
And on the first date, remember the minutes spent together
You called me Rainman, then kissed me for three seconds
Ooh, no one else has ever fit the equation quite like you

[Hook]
White picket fence and house to make love
Two kids and a dog named Doug
Thanksgiving dinner, snow fast in the winter
Keys to the truck, crib and the car
Add the life that we live for us
Get rid of the life that we live for us
Multiply by trust, divide by trust
It equals love, equals love
You're part of the math, you're part of the math
You're part of the math, you're part of it all
You're part of the math, you're part of the math
The math, the math, the math, the math

[Verse 2]
You see, if colors were numbers, you'd be a fuchsia seven
And I'd be a platinum three, and we could be a ten together
Oh, and I don't ever want to part, subtraction or division
And if you ever left
I'd go full calculus to get you back, back, back
Geometry, you're math
Cause the fact is, no one else quite fit the equation like that

[Hook]

You're part of the math, you're part of the math
You're part of the math, you're part of it all
You're part of the math, you're part of the math
The math, the math, the math, the math

[Bridge]
I said, one plus one says it equals two
Baby me and you only equals love (It equals love, it equals love)
If one means one then it just ain't two
And it can't be love cause it's only one

Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize

[Verse]
I memorized the wayward expressions
Never look down
Never let you see me down
I memorized the way no directions
Can I come over now
I'd like to stay a little while
I memorized your body exposed
I can fuck you all night long
From a memory alone

I never forget a face
Don't go plastic on me
Nothing's set in stone
You're not dipped in gold
Dipped in gold
You can't breathe if you're dipped in gold
You are not on paper
You are not a copy
You're so, you're so..so thick, so thick

[Verse 1]
I'll stack these magazines in the corner
After I'm done with them
And I still got the same hope that I started with
That you'll be in one of them
My camera shed some tears since you left him
With nothing, with nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to remember?
I got the memories
But memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl?
When I'm older, and my mind is telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

[Verse 2]
We didn't make love
We celebrated its invention
Confetti on the mattress - I used to have those images
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
Along with my hard drive, no notes, no goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Tell me now, I got the memories
But memories don't last...
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?
When I'm older, and my mind's telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you

[Verse 3]
No videos, no polaroids
No record of the love we had
My Nikon wasn't fast enough
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frame, no
Just got them little basic ones that the pictures frames come with
Models, wedding pictures, you know

[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so...

[Intro]
That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice 'cause his wind gone
Niggas sound like Reggie
(Already, ran through already
Nigga goin' in, fuck it)

[Verse]
Pray to the pipe, (fuck it) I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow, I'm mindful of size
She chock full of my swipe, like a capsule sealed tight
With that substance you need, start a family tonight
Big body Merc, LED lights and it's all overprice
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in, from the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watching my fence, like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope, got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my my
Get it, get it

[Intro]
When the wind blows
That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice cause his wind gone
Nigga sound like Reggie
If life is a woman them walls gone
They ran through her already

[Verse]
I'm thinking
My life is a virgin like wife in all white and
Tonight I'm determined
To give her insight, eat her right till she creams
'Till she writhes with delight
Andale andale, make her pray to the pipe
Make her worship that false phallic idle
I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow
I'm mindful of size
She's chockful of my swipe like a capsule
Sealed tight with that substance you need
Start a family tonight
In this Camry we might
Mean this big body Merc with the leather
Oak and the LED lights
That I don't even drive
I'm in London tonight
And it's all overpriced
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in
From the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich
Or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watchin' my fence
Like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope
Got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my my
Get it, get it

All day plagues, I've wondered
We threw grace, I'll find a new high (?)
Could it be you?

[Verse 1]
Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch Westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Live in the clouds
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Life in the clouds
Keep em high, y'all
Beautiful stars
In the sky

[Verse 2]
Monks in the mosh pit
Stage diving Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a runaway, young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhaya Mudra

[Bridge]
I never ask for much
But please keep up lover
We've got no choices left
The running's fast
Run, run, run, run
You're beautiful to me
Run, run, run, run, you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world, my world

[Verse 3]
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archers' bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end

[Outro]
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Keep 'em high, y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me, oh (Right)
Beautiful

MY RANDOM

I miss all the tension
When all this is over
I'm moving to ghana
You sus and you watching me
They used to be brown
Now them contacts is green
Why the fucks u finessing me
I know how many licks
It'll take me to get
To the center of ecstasy
How come the ecstasy
Only depresses me so
Chemically I don't have
Any new places to go
Every face looks pale
When the seraton' gets a lil low
When they lower my coffin
Bet a few bitches jumpin in the hole
Few old ones that I left alone
I never lie cus I don't remember
No tales cus it's two heads
Even twelve got a lil forgiveness
Who do you love?

[Verse 1]
The first time your name was used
It was beauty and I knew
Sat in a violet room with some people I saw through
Gathered 'round the television's fire
Watching for the people I admired
Outside my words were frozen in my mouth
I couldn't let them out

[Chorus]
When I see my willing heart
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?

[Verse 2]
It's a strange spell that we lust for
Every now and then, every now and then
Every now and then, every now and then

[Chorus]
When I see my willing heart
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?
[Verse 3]
It's a strange spell that we watch for
And one I swear I never saw
Every now and then, every now and then
Every now and then
You're still on my screen
Every now and then
You're still on my screen
Every now and then
There's a glare from the sun and it's heavenly
Every now and then

[Chorus]
When I see my willing heart
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?

[Verse 4]
It's a strange spell that we watch for
Every now and then
You're still on my screen
Every now and then
They must have heard my scream
Every now and then
There's a glare from the sun and it's deafening
Every now and then
[Chorus]
When I see my willing heart
How will I know?
How will I walk slow?

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Been breathing so hard, we both could use the oxygen
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Just hop on my back, I'll take you down the stairs
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Into my backyard, then lay you right on the grass, eh

[Pre-Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Give it to you over again, over again, over again
Over again

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Making love
Underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl
Tell me how my nature feels
Said, oh, baby (Oh, baby)
Up against the cherry tree (Ah, ah)
Baby girl (Baby girl)
I'll give it to you naturally
Naturally, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Feeling like Adam when he first found out this existed
"Ha, wow..."
Me and my Eve trying out our first positions
Ha, yeah
And it's all good, and it's all free
And it's all you, and it's only me
Playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you
Yeah (Ah-ah)

[Pre-Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Give it you over again, over again, over again
Over again

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Said, making love
Underneath the cherry leaves (Ah, ah, ah)
Baby girl
Tell me how my nature feels (Ah, ah)
Said oh, baby (Oh, baby)
Up against the cherry tree (Ah, ah)
Baby girl (Baby girl)
I'll give it to you naturally

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
My cavewoman
I'm a caveman
Doing wild things
In a wild land
We keep going, baby
We keep getting it, baby
We'll get pebbles, maybe
A couple bam-bams
Bam, bam
Bang, bang
Girl, your heart goes
Bam and bang
Feel my heart go, go, go...

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Bridge: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys, I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me, want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation, y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out, I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free, you niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me, you know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys, fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves, y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye, y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country so you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters, so I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up, they tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison, get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons, braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house, I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse and in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up, I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out, now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro: Kanye West, Frank Ocean and Kobor Janos]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh

My father was a black panther
My father who ain't in heaven

[Verse 1]
My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"

"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?

[Bridge] (2x)
You see there's leaders and there's followers

You see there's leaders and there's followers

[Outro: Kanye West and Frank Ocean]
I won't end this high, not this time again

Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
(Too high again, too high)


[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waiting on you all my night
I'll buzz you in just let me know when you outside
All my night, you been missing all my night
Still got some good nights memorised
And the look back's getting me right

[Part II: wet wet]

[Verse: StoryofSaint]
I just took a portal to the nether, I'm returning never, if you want me hit my cell up (My cell up)
Dots and cuts, my area is fashioned
Blades could propel you, get the hell-i out my sector (My sector)
These villains walk around with the ender (ender), draggin' youths to creep up on a nigga
Squeezing triggers same way they squeeze rations, now he got to rob you to make sure it doesn't happen (It won't happen)
All I want was mansions with the mandem chatting pasa ('ing pasa)
Moonrock on the block'll make you think you stepped in NASA (In NASA)
'Bout to make it great again and I ain't talking MAGA (MAGA)
When I die, somebody tell the mayor I want a statue (A statue)
I done way too much to let my mama be unhappy (Unhappy)
C-D-X-V-I-I, Roman numerals I stand by (I stand by)
Never been the bad guy but my folks'll call me bad man (Bad Mon), something 'bout the treatment of these niggas
I-C-Y-M-I I am the real'est, tired of the villains? Nah (!)
Yah-ah-ah

[Interlude]
See, I'm just cruising in the coupe because my tunes sound better
Kingpin, I got my own damn agenda
Pretty Ricky, if I want her, I'ma get her
I ain't got to worry who getting jealous, darling

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Wanna see Nirvana, but don't want to die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every night shit

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, (bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a seance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you, everybody needs you
Oooh, nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnin's, ahh
New beginnin's, wake up akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, my every day shit
(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)

[Bridge]
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right

[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every night shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every night shit

[Intro]
Go for it

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody, being honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporate
My whole body see-through
Transportation, handmade (G!)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy, have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right, you know I won't need you
And I tell you (Biiitch!)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that, I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation, can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a seance?
You were from my past life, hope you're doing well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first, signal coming in and out (Huh?)
Hope you're doing well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Oooh, nani nani (Ooh, nani, oh)

No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body, ugh!
[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep being late on me
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, everyday shit

[Chorus]
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that nana, though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
Every night shit
Night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit

[Verse 2]
Bubble goose down, blue punch
Pocari Sweat, ghost sweat
Her wet wet, her mouth wet, two things I don't regret
My dick long, memory long, two things she don't forget
Game drives so wet, my Black friends just wear black
But only fly in black jets, if it's roulette, black's best
Niggas ain't sold crack yet
Flyin' private, ain't wasting seats
Niggas lapped up in that bitch
Black bodies in the summer breeze
Runnin' four flats, tryna get in the lead
Tryna get in the league and play wide receiver
Nigga, pass the sticks, call winners winners
Up-seat, gotta walk it off
Winners hate to lose, gotta run they mouth
Sets thrown, now they lockin' up
We ain't break it up
Tryna see who face getting knotted up
That was Monday, we was back friends on Tuesday
Still talkin' 'bout it 'til this day
Need fifty hunnas, that's 5 racks
Hit Costco, keep the fam fat
Fuck a weed-man, grow your own plants
Tell the cashier give you five blacks and the purple packs
Some loud burnin' out on the grill
Black Adonis on the diving board
Gainers only, I'm bringing Guinness
Jordans floatin' on the deep end of the pool (Yes)
Somebody got thrown in again, y'all are fools
Phone drown on the concrete in the summer blaze
Blaze too, blaze too
And it better work when the morning breaks through

[Break]
Oh we gon' line it up? Nah, nah
I just... What?!

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnings, ahh
[Inaudible talking]
New beginnings wake up, akh
The sun's going down
(I just got these shoes man)
Time to start your day, bruh
(Look at 'em... Look, they're fucked)
Can't keep being late on me
(Some more fuckin' shit)
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
[Inaudible talking]
The every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that nana, though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, every night shit, everyday shit
Every night shit
Night shit, night shit, night shit

Everyday patches the night up
On god u should match it it's that KO
No white lighters till I fuck my 28th up

1998 my family had the acura
Aww the legend/
Kept at least 6 discs in changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the reverends
Preaching self made millionaire status
When we  could only eat at Shoney's on occasion

After trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night
Dropping baby off at home
Before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though
Could you come by
Fuck wit me after my night shift
You know them boys wanna see me broke down
Bummed out
Stressed out
Everyday shit
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit everynight shit
My everyday shit everynight shit

Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
-was our philosophy
Oooh, nani nani (ooh ah)
No bitch [?]
Your [?] in my lap, uh
Backwards at Pilates
Back to back that voodoo got-

[Verse 1]
Can't break my heart if it's already broken
Can't dry your eyes if they already soaking
What's done is done and now we left with the blunt of our repercussions
Communication is dead there ain't no need for discussions
I block yo gram soon as I can so i can't see who you fuck with
These new adjustments hit my body with a clang
How we go from co-pilots to us jumping from the plane
Now we both gone show silence as we cover up our pains
How the growth was once vibrant now it hides beneath the blame
Is it me or is it you?
Lack accountability for all the things we do
Quickly making these decisions without niggas thinking through
Difference in the moves only show that we similar in our forms of healing
I like to drink away my woes, you like to force the feelings
Out ya body like you got exorcists here performing magic
We drive reckless with emotions so of course we crashing
But there ain't no airbag to support our sadness
Plus we ain't prepare with any form of action
Enough of passion
We passively get aggressive
We barely trust what we saying
We asking each other questions
You trying to go through my phone
I'm trying to get on your socials
We heating up more than ever
We finally getting vocal
You try telling me I'm wrong
And i hate accusations
I feel the patience in my body start evaporating
Evacuation of the scene might just be the best
Hesitation in my legs
My heart start beating through my chest
How our frequencies meet static, how these pieces don't connect
We was pose to be them Twitter goals these dreams gon be suppressed

[Bridge]
But i now it feel that love is fading
It don't come around
Stuck out in the ocean
You gon watch me drown
Sluggish in my motions
When you let me down
This shit is getting ugly
Please don't hit my line
Because you never loved me
Please don't waste time
Cause you never trust me
Second chances dead
Cause you forever dub me

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for ASAP, R.I.P. Pimp C
R.I.P. Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel, like twigs wit' them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body-jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came witcha
But he ain't witcha
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I may be younger, but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here, I'll save some for you
I'm not him, but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

These bitches want Nikes (This is a setup)
They looking for a check (Oh my god)
Tell em it ain't likely (This bitch tryna set me up)
Said she need a ring like Carmelo (Hands up, oh my god)
Must be on that white like Othello (Oh my, it's a real life angel)
All you want is Nikes (Yeah)
But the real ones just like you (Tell these niggas)
Just like me (Tell these guys you ain't basic)

[Verse 1]
I don't play, I don't make time
(Tell these guys you wear Zanottis, you a hottie, this is heaven on earth)
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line

Love everybody)
Pour up for ASAP (rest in peace)
RIP Pimp C (rest in peace)
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!

That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
(That's rule number one
Rule number two: don't take no photos in the party)
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
(Rule number three: I got one left)
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath
Weighted down
(If you in the-)
Punk madre, punk papa
(If you couldn't get to the-, go your ass to sleep, we in the-)
He don't care for me
(Special shoutout to them live niggas at Rap-A-Lot records)
But he cares for me
(We keep it hot)
And that's good enough
(I've been working on my bod, I feel hot)
We don't talk much or nothin'
(If we in the- holla at ya gwalla)
But when we talkin' about something
(Oh my god, hold up)
We have good discussion
(Tell these basic bitches we don't wear Nike)
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to something
(You guys are naughty, you a hottie, hold up)
That's good for us

[Verse 2]
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy

We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first

It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

[Verse 1]
I'm running from the man, I'm running from my flag
I made love to my lady before I packed
I left her while she slept
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cos I got her

[Hook]
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
But I won't risk her life for mine
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

[Verse 2]
I'm running water through my hands
And flipping pictures in my head of her
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun
So I wouldn't worry as much
Oh, last night
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cos I got her
(I got you, oh)

[Hook]
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(I wis you could be my Bonnie)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(Won't risk your life)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(I know you love me)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(You wanna be where I am, but no, girl)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie

[Bridge]
The money should last awhile
But I know without a dime she got me
When the feds come around she got me
No snitching allowed from my baby

[Hook]
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(My Bonnie)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(My Bonnie)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie
(No Bonnie)
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(Oh girl, I wish you could be mine)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(Won't you risk your life, no Bonnie, your life)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

[Outro]
So sorry
So sorry
No Bonnie

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked, whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It's something that the pastor don't preach
It's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild

[Verse 1]
Okay, thought about it for a minute
Can't let love go spinnin' down the drain now
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
Simple math, pen and pad; gotta work out
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
But you're my only, baby you're my only
Just grab a pencil, don't you wanna help out
It can't be hard

[Pre-Hook]
You gotta find the answers to the problem
Ain't no answers here without you, no

[Hook]
I been writin' all day, fillin' my page
Tryna fix this, wreckin' my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writin' all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm gonna tell you everything
The whole truth, not fractions of a bad lie
You're my homie, baby you're my only
She's the past, you're my future, my right now
You're my only, baby you're my only
And I'm sorry, girl you gotta know it
Grab a seat, just try to hear me out girl
I know it's hard

[Pre-Hook]
You gotta find the answers to the problem
Ain't no answers here without you, no

[Hook]
I been writin' all day, fillin' my page
Tryna fix this, wreckin' my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writin' all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love

[Bridge]
Wish I could use a calculator, but it won't even work
I can't use an elevator, to get back up to you
To get back up to you
Never had a clue

[Hook]
I been writin' all day, fillin' my page
Tryna fix this, wreckin' my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writin' all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love
I been writin' all day, fillin' my page
Tryna fix this, wreckin' my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writin' all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love
I been writin' all day, fillin' my page
Tryna fix this, wreckin' my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writin' all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love

[Verse 1]
I'm knocking on your door, and it's cold, yes it's cold
But I brought your favorite flowers, teddy bear and a card
Cause I know that loving me is a chore, it's a chore
But I won't stop loving you that's for sure, that's for sure

[Hook]
You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there's no way, no how I'll stop loving you
It's non-stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
It won't stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain't gonna slow
It's non stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
I sat down in my car, not to leave, just to park
I'm still not losing hope, though the sky's getting dark
I wish you'd just peak out the blinds to my heart
But you turned your bedroom light on
Well at least that's a start

[Hook]
You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there's no way, no how I'll stop loving you
It's non-stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
It won't stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain't gonna slow
It's non stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Bridge]
Said I'm sorry, oh baby
But the love won't stop, no no, nah uh
Take me back, oh love, Take me back
Cause the love will keep flowing on
The love will keep flowing on

[Verse 1]
Clean your room, momma's coming home soon
She needs you, momma's gonna burn too
Close your eyes and remember all of me, and I will take you to eternity
You've got a sundress on it's december, I missed my flight but I can't remember

[Pre Hook]
Carry me to the trees, I want to know what you mean to me
Carry me, help me feel free, I kinda know what you need, what you need

[Hook]
Oi Ah ah
Got me peelin on a light
Got me got me fucked up
On me million dollar bike
Got me got me fucked up
Got my million dollar bike
Got me got me fucked up
Got me setting up up, Got me

[Verse 2]
I get your feedback marry her, (get me on my bike)
But I don't want to run away with ya (get me on my bike)
And I'm not trying to build some character (get me on a bike)
On your one track mind

[Bridge]
An add-on room where it starts again, asleep at noon, where did this all begin? Man, I wish she' slip my mind, fucked up that night
But I know I'd try again. Another fight, should I start begging, knew I wish I'd been right honey, knew I wish I'd been right honey, knew I wish I'd been right

[Outro]
Do you want her? Or do you want this high life?
(do you want me?)
Do you want her? Or do you want this high life?
(do you want me?)
Do you want love? Or do you want this low life?
(do you want me?)
Do you want love? Or do you want this low life?
(do you want me?)
Well, I know them,  come comb my hair, (don't comb my hair)
I missed my flight because of you, (I missed my flight)
Well, I don't care

[Snippet]

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead
Young queen, cross your legs

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
'cause even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't set foot in no penitentiary
And don't taste the poison
Don't you bail on your families

if i could dream about this place right now that'd be nice. had a dream about obama and some missing kid last night. i was in a warehouse fight scene too for some reason. like a jackie chan rumble in the bronx type thing. i think it's because i watched too much tv yesterday. i mean, I'mma lil sick so i saw more of the tv yesterday than i would normally see in a week. that shit messes with your mind man.

currently on a long ass plane ride. going through my own little existential crisis. i wish i could talk to you all as friends. and im tempted, but the truth is you're a mixed crowd. so i'll spare the details... for now. unfortunately this emo shit is running concurrently with the most progressive weeks of my career so far. i'd like to enjoy the success more. but.. i am experiencing success. which is more than many could ever say. i don't have any noteworthy or overwhelming gripes about this business. i may call certain people/institutions out for their bullshit from time to time. but the way i see it i make a decent living doing exactly what the fuck i want. how could i not be grateful? besides, i'm not famous. maybe a little popular. i do think social networks can make you feel a little bit more poppin than you actually are though. hahaha. anyhow, im gonna get a dog soon. i know it might not make sense.. i mean i'll be/have been traveling a lot more frequently than i'm used to. but the companionship just might keep me off the proverbial 'ledge'. what do you think of this guy?alrite. alrite. let's get this out in the open. the only songs that i, myself, frank ocean, have ever released are...'pyrite', 'acura integurl' and of course the songs included on 'nostalgia, ultra'. all other songs are on the internet as a result of record industry email hacks/leaks that happened some years back. several of these songs i had no hand in writing. i only laid reference vox on em because i was being paid. the rest are incomplete ideas, reference songs that were sent out for placement on other artists. records that were never intended to represent me. notwithstanding, i am a chill bro. as well as a sage/zen master in training. so im not angry or anything. i just had to let it at least be known. enjoy.

[Skit: Rosie Watson]
Stop thinking of this as being money
It's just money, I'ma make more
No, no no no no no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing
Let's see, I have
Ooh yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you
Saving my seven dollars

[Verse 1]
I'm willing to die doing this shit
Might even take a life for this shit
By that I mean decode their lies for this shit
And watch you cry cause your shit

Freezer got gold rims
In debt, now go dim
This is what happens
When you too focused on balance

[Chorus]
Dollars come in a bakers dozen
Like we getting bread
But I know focusing on that too much
Will get us dead

So try to understand my footprints
But at the same time, make your own blueprints
If you want it, go for it
But know it's not just money

[Verse 2]
You're worrying about how much wealth it is
So you can add to your wrist
I'm confused how mumbling can get you a car
In the future, it can only take you so far

I won't judge what you wanna do
But it's kinda talentless, it's the truth
Like Cole said, "Imma make sure the real gon' prevail."
And not the people that only worry about the sales

Those sales might not even get you a nice boat
But that cold hard cash could maybe get you a coat
You're washing yourself in this ego to cope
And you messed up like you just dropped the soap

Ever since I was born in 2003
My family trying to make ends meet
Living in brick houses like Rob Zombie
And now I still don't care about where I live this week

[Chorus]
Dollars come in a bakers dozen
Like we getting bread
But I know focusing on that too much
Will get us dead

So try to understand my footprints
But at the same time, make your own blueprints
If you want it, go for it
But know it's not just money

[Verse 1]
I think I started something
I got what I wanted
Did-didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
At least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste"
But can you taste a little taste?

[Chorus]
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Verse 2]
Sink full of dishes, pacin' in the kitchen
Cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod
Little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick
This is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
But it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow
I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had
Never had, never had (Never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back
And pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around
Quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smokin' anyway? (Ahh)
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" (Ooh)
But can you taste a little taste?

[Chorus]
Novacane, baby, baby (Ohh)
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Bridge]
Novacane, novacane, novacane
Novacane, novacane (Ohh)
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain
Numb the pain, numb the pain (Ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane, novacane
Novacane, novacane
For the pain, for the pain (Ohh, ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane (Ooh)

[Outro]
Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, I can't feel a thing
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane, novacane, novacane
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane for the pain, for the pain
I can't, can't feel her
Feel her, feel her, ohh
Novacane, novacane-cane

(You see this motherfucking face)
Blessings, blessings, yeah, I see..

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Dope boy still smelling like cocaina
White boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner?
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
I'm anti-Santa Maria
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket
Black card go hard when I'm shopping
Boat docked in front of Hermes picking cotton
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick
See me in shit you never saw
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
Aww, whole world's in awe
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Me and Ty Ty is like Pablo and Popeye
Winding dirt roads on mopeds spilling Opus
Welcome to the magnum opus, the Magna Carta
The best-selling author Decoded
On the holiday playin' "Strange Fruit"
If I'ma make it to a billi, I can't take the same route
Swoosh, that's the sound of the border
Swoosh, and that's the sound of a baller
Muhammad Hovi my back against the rope
The black Maybach, I'm back inside the boat
Shepard Fairey they finally gave me some hope
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote
Democrat? Nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn how to float
On the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

[Verse 1]
Fairy-tales come and take my hand
Turn the page and help me understand
Maybe, I'll fall in love again
If I know how the story ends
Her song has me
Looking for traces of my melody
And I slowly hum, sing the simple phrase
And not another she can deny
Caught in the sound waves
She can feel my every line
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah

[Hook]
So ohh in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

[Verse 2]
Found a way to whisper in her ear
Everything I wanted her to hear
Said I would catch her every tear
Hold her through the many years
So long I've been looking
For chances of this heart in me
Now I know that she's the lyric and the tune
That explains the meaning of life
There is no music
Without her to give it to me
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah
[Hook]
So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the one she loves
And I'm hoping that she plays me

Ohh in love

[Intro: Taco and Tyler, the Creator]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude
Shouts out to L-Boy, awwwwk
I told you

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
The big-eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, "Catch up, nigga," it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark-skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead (Not a Logic)
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five-panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang see, he did come back, though)

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
What's up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak (Yeah)
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher (What up, what up, what's up, smoke)
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
(We out here)
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, "Get 'em, Mike G," then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Culk
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area (Motherfuckin' area)
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
('Fore I bury ya)
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
(Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya)
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? (Wassup?)
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude: Frank Ocean]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a supercar for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pothead, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo)
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch (Wow)
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit (Woo)
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap (Shit)
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat (Cat)

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin and Earl Sweatshirt]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face (Ugh)
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler, the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word
And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah
Golf Wang

[Verse 1]
No baby don't do that, don't touch that
Could you please be still? (Baby, stop)
No baby, you can't have that, until you eat your dinner
Guess I gotta treat you like a baby girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing, oh oh
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, all for it
But it ain't easy, you won't make it easy

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Verse 2]
Now you know you should be sleeping, but okay
I'll give you ten more minutes
We've been sleeping in the same bed
Cause you been having nightmares
And you need me here
I guess I always treat you like a baby girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing aw yeah
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, uh huh
But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Verse 3]
You want love? Well no more sugar for you
And you don't know how to act, so no more sugar for you
You're jumping off the walls, no more sugar for you
I said ain't no sugar for you
Well, just a little bit, but

[Chorus]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror

[Verse 1]
I've seen it and I liked it much
I told myself I had to have it
I looked, but I do not touch
Wondering why does she walk like that (that, that)
There was something in those jeans
Locked up
It was dying to be free
And it was bound to happen, oh

[Pre-Hook 1]
Didn't have a pick up line to use
I was way too cool, way too cool
And instead I hoped you're watching me too
Like I watched you

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

[Hook 2]
That's a good look baby, baby
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look
My eyes must have been on drugs
Your color and your shape looked so crazy
I couldn't see the floor beneath you
But, baby, I could see you pacing on
Thin air, mid-air, no
Long brown hair swinging, no
Red bottoms in your high heels
Like I'm watching a Blu-Ray

[Pre-Hook 2]
You in HD baby
I didn't know what to say
I was way too cool, I'm way too cool
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too
Oh yeah, you know it's true

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

[Bridge]
I wanna stare at you some more
When I can feel you in my soul
I'm not looking from the outside
I could feel your hands in mine
I wanna grab on your body
Touching that booty
Feeling on your booty
Say that you love it
And you said it's all mine

[Hook 1]
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, couldn't run away from you
No, couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look
[Hook 2]
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look

[Intro]
What, where am I?

[Verse 1]
What's life like on a train?
Nobody there knows your name
As your decision changed
Do you wish that I came?
I thought you'd pick me up from work
I waited for your truck for half hour
I know you said you were gonna
But I never thought you'd leave

[Chorus]
This one thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody, oh

[Verse 2]
Square face and puppy eyes
Found out they never lied
Your old man lived in the sky
Left your house with a yard
But you went away a different try
Found a place that's your size
Too good to finish life here with me
I couldn't get you to say
Why you wouldn't let me come
What should be simple just ain't
And it shouldn't hurt like it does

[Chorus]
This one thing is made for us
Won't stay with us, it ain't saving us
But I'll take one thing over everything
I'll take that thing over anybody

[Bridge]
Baby, hold me, don't pick me up
I need a compliment
Just a touch from a friend
I need a gentle word
I need your company
I'll keep

[Chorus]
One thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over anything
I take that thing over anybody
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody
Oh, oh, anything
Oh, oh, take one thing

[Verse 1]
I fall on my knees and pray
For heaven to show me the answer
Make me complete today
Soul, heart, body, and mind
If I could ask for just one more thing
Send to me the perfect lover
And I, Wouldn't want for anything
I'll be happy in time, my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing

[Verse 2]
I hold out my hand
And pledge never to sell myself short
I'm vow to hold my head up
And i'm gonna keep it high
And I go out into the world wondering
If I make it too hard to find someone
To love me for me no more wasting my time
My heart
[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
Missing that One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing

[Bridge]
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who's gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Really need that one thing
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who's gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Just that one thing
[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
Missing that One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing

[Bridge]
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who's gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Really need that one thing
Is it too much to ask
For a man that I can love who's gonna love me back?
Give me that one more thing
Cause I need that
Just that one thing
[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts so ready to fall
But the fact I got it all
It all means nothing if I ain't got love

[Chorus]
Missing that one thing
One touch, one kiss
I need that one thing
Just that one more thing
Missing that One thing, one touch, one kiss
I need that one thing

[Verse 1]
Sitting by my window
Watching the moonlight
In my home
Suddenly my mind
Is bringing out desire
In my home
So I got a new man
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

[Verse 2]
So I had a phone call
From a new man
In my home
He was burning
Burning of desire
Just like I do
He wanted me to
Put out this fire
Burning in his soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby

In my home
So I got a new man
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby

[Verse 1]
I had my feet in the water
And right when I was about to get up
Oh, suddenly I caught ya
With a hook line and a sinker
You were swimming at the bottom, yeah
I said why you gon live down there
Well baby you can love up here, on land
And what a difference it makes, you'll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Verse 2]
You said you're feeling ways
That you never could've felt under all that pressure
Used to it being dark at night, and you're kinda afraid of the lights
But you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive
And what a difference it makes, you'll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Bridge]
Baby I could show you the world
And the seed that's inside of my heart, baby
Don't know how you got on land in the first place
Just promise you won't go back again
It's better up here you know
Just trying my best to show you
But you started feeling like you're floating higher and higher
Don't ever go under no more

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

When I-

[Verse 1]
I remember being immortal
I though that I was
I wanted to conquer the world
Before I could drive

I remember when you were born
Ohhh, how happy I was
Cause If it didn't go as I planned it
At least you'd double my chances

[Bridge]
And it's no pressure, man
Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)

You gotta know you hit the lotto (lotto)
Cause they don't make em like mamma no more
Hug her and tell her that you love her
That's good time spent

And when your outside running
It's ok to as where you're going
So you're never back where you started
Wondering where time went

[Part 1: PartyIsntOver]

[Verse: Tyler The Creator]
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator]
Yeah, um
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting

[Interlude: Kids]
We're making s'mores by the campfire
Camp Flog Gnaw, Golf Wang summer

[Verse 2: Laetitia Sadier]
Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, but radical
Transformation ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart

[Interlude: Tyler, the Creator]
Yo bring the bass back in
Yeah, haha
Who ate all the fuckin' chocolate?
Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha
Yeah
I ain't trying to go home, really

[Part 3: Bimmer]

[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your headlights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator and (Frank Ocean)]
Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame Impala
(It'll get dark outside soon)
And I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You're fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don't know, I think you're chill
(Ride for)
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah

[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your headlights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Mmmm it'll get dark outside, soon (My baby, ride for me)
Where the street lights trail (My baby, ride for me)
You ain't gotta lie to kick it darling
It's cool we're moving slow

[Bridge: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer, smash
You remind me of my bimmer

[Outro: Lionel]
Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
I got a can of these baked beans too

[Verse 1]
Intimate scenes, fresh from my dreams
Of a triple X movie scene
I could care less about being seen
A higher self-esteem if you on me (Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar's so sweet, it'll rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me, yeah
Spoiled crazy

[Hook]
Public display of affection (Got 'em hatin')
Pointin' in our direction (Watch 'em watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
We be at the club, the restaraunt
The grocery store or the movie
Kissin' and touchin' with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, we is, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A

[Verse 2]
Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets
And were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we meet, the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense, you being tense
Has got me convinced
You're the fingers to my instrument
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
From the lobby to the patio (Boy you're so crazy)
And we so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navajo (You nasty)
And we so compatible

[Break]
The club, the restaraunt
The grocery store or the movie
Kissin' and touchin' with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, yes, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A

[Outro]
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)

[Verse 1]
I'll stack these magazines in the corner
After I'm done with them
And I still got the same hope that I started with
That you'll be in one of them
My camera shed some tears since you left him
With nothing, with nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
How am I supposed to remember?
I got the memories
But the memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl?
When I'm older, and my mind is telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

[Verse 2]
We didn't make love, we celebrated its invention
Confetti on the mattress - I used to have those images
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
Along with my hard drive, no notes, no goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Tell me now, the memories
The memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?
When I'm older, and my mind's telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you

[Bridge]
No videos, no polaroids, yeah
No record of the love we had, yeah
My Nikon wasn't fast enough
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frames, no
Just got them, little basic ones that the pictures frames come with
Models, wedding pictures, you know

[Chorus]
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

[Verse 1]

And I still got the same hope that I started with

[Intro]
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (Ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (High)
Go head, fly that thing!
High, high, yeah
But fly alone

[Verse 1]
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known

[Chorus]
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

[Verse 2]
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse
And no, I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known, ever known
[Chorus]
I know what I was on (Ever known)
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

[Verse 3]
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'ma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my Pilot Jones

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
And the peaches and the mangos
That you could sell for me

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Hey, hey
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

[Outro: Andre 3000]
You're good at being bad, you're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fucking good
Make her swab the mu'fucking wood
Make her walk the mu'fucking plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

[Intro: Big Boi and Frank Ocean]
Remix
And the peaches and the mangos that you could sell for me

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?

That soft pink matter

My God, she's giving me pleasure
Oh, nah, nah

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet, then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure over matter
[Verse 3: Big Boi and Andre 3000]
(Hey, hey) Yeah
Doesn't matter if she wanna be with me, so it's cool
I make her call me B.B. King because I give her the blues
But not on purpose though, she was the perfect ho-stess
When I come over, we would do the grossest
Most beautiful-est things on a bed of roses
Would be the coldest when you hit the hardwood floor
We sippin' 'Gnac, not mimosas
She's in my naked lap, goin' HAM like she supposed to
And she could make it clap if I told her
Or make her ass spread like the back of a cobra
Standin' at attention like a soldier
A G.I. Joe, man, see, me, I go in (Ask a bitch, nigga)
Yeah, that nigga goes up in it
Like smoke through a chimney (Hey, hey)
Slow stroke, 'cause she feelin' me up in her, nigga
Killin' me softly, raw dog, she wants me
Strong and black like her coffee, get off me
Act a donkey, I pin her tail to the mattress
I've been a player, make her go from classy to nasty
Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty (Ha, ha, ha)
To sloosh (Hey, hey)

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw

You're good at being bad (Yep)
You're bad at being good (Oh)
For Heaven's sakes, go to Hell
Kno-, knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
You're bad at being good
(For Heaven's sakes, go to Hell, knock on wood)
For Heaven's sakes, go to Hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well frankly when that ocean so muh'fuckin' good
Make her swab the muh'fuckin' wood
Make her walk the muh'fuckin' plank
Make her rob a muh'fuckin' bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, uh (woo!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Verse 2]
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

[Chorus]
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Outro: Frank Ocean and Beyonce]
Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality

Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse]
Grand mommy told me: "Don't run from no police" (Fuck 'em)
Grand mommy told me: "Watch out for yo partners" (I love 'em)
Saying "They too much older, won't you stay in your range?"
I been trying to sponge, been trying to know some things
See the mailman keep coming, and the bills keep on coming in
And all you wanna do is fight me on this shit
You say: "Don't go bending yo wrist, don't go being no sissy."
OK
"Don't go locking no doors, you ain't paying no rent in this bitch," OK
Checks I used to bring
They wouldn't make no difference in this bitch
Now the checks I bring, I mean
Who else paying the rent in this bitch?
Landlord see me outside, wanna take a picture
I said I gotta autograph on the check you can take it with ya
He said "The house on sale, you wanna buy it?"
I say, "Not this one."
Gotta make moves, not a ton of moves, tryna keep it simple
This summer
Said you didn't wanna go with me
That's a bumma, bumma, bumma, yeah
Boppin' at Bacchus, that was the first parade
Bounce remixes of Aaliyah had the spinal cords crackin', crackin'
Cups of methazine had 'em lean like Michael Jackson
Yeah
And you was fuckin' with your nose trying to be a Jackson
Oh yeah
Poolside convo, about your summer last night

[Intro]
Now, to the edge I'll race
To the end I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my faux friends
We pour a taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The height right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now
That might be what you need

[Verse]
What it means to be alive on this side
(Said you wanna kill me now)
On this side
(Don't let me down)
On this side
(Down, down)
Fuck the other side
I'm on this side, I'm on this side, I'm on this side
How it feels to have arrived

Those are my niggas for life
Mothers of us be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us be kind

Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah

Oh, oh, oh

Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a

Then I'll applaud you, and then

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh

Memo finna start acting out if I don't see him soon
Yeah my best friend ain't backing out, it's still on sight, fool
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
Trophy case still light, body need a race stripe
And these minerals on my body break light
And these reds on my body brakelight
New man comin' up ahead on his own two
Is you a natural blondie like Goku?
Sleepin' on my belly in a loop like a serpent
Talking Heads ripplin' on the surface

Provided, diamond lane that didn't exist
Packed the Astro van and brought my kids through
Prada tee on the eldest, throw the Gildan on the children
Hand-me-down fits
Chest pass, see mist off rotation (Swish, swisha)
Stiff smile just like I'm Aphex Twin (Yeah, come to daddy, yeah)
Pat the Patagonia pockets, tryna find my zip (uh, where it's at? Yeah)
Blunt twist, tightropes, I'm not fallin' off (never that, no)
Watch friends, go pro through fisheye lens, drownin' off clear
I just saw JAWS, divin' under influence
Been feelin' like the Lord just out of reach for me (for me)
How I feel lettin' man speak
How I feel lettin' man speak for me (for me)
Holyfield, keep your ears split for me
Can't show my face if you spit for me
Spit for me, yeah

[Intro: ASAP Rocky]
I've been busy (Busy, busy)
I've been fuckin' busy, I've been busy fuckin'
I've been all kinds of busy, or sorta kinda busy
Like shorty is we fuckin'? Well if not then fuck it
Apologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em
Said I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'
It's busy shit, busy that, busy this
And I need a minute (Hold on)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, ASAP Rocky, and Frank Ocean]
See this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ooh, going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (I'm going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violins on the floor
Fast forward, linings on my skull
This the type of design I could afford
Fast forward, bands out
Got they hands out like they acknowledgin' the Fuhrer
I rewind, Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense
Just like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me
Raw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass
Pour it in foam, this white got eggshells in my omelet
My earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck
Woof, woof-dogs in the place, loose tooth-lost in the fray
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rozay, brute force, Brut champagne
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable slow, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth, chewing on nothing
You're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'
You're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you're overthinkin'
One blink and I'm pre-cummin'
That could turn every no one into someone

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Frank Ocean and ASAP Rocky]
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ohh, do do, do do, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
I just need peace of mind for my purity
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky and Lauryn Hill]
Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keepin' me up and focused
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
NY throwback like the old Fab
"I'm undone because"
Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
Hold up, hold that (Hold on, my nigga, hold that-) thought
Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough, tryna hold back
The call had dropped when the FaceTime paused, don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco
Saint like Joan of Arc, bro, ring barcode
Two of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face-to-face with my demons at a barstool
Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost nothin' since September
Last seen her September '16
Man it feels like
"I'm undone because"
Lose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me (ASAP)
Press is gone and I grief, I share with you my peace
[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
"I'm undone because-"
"I'm undone because-"

[Part I]

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They have taken Cleopatra

[Bridge]
Run run run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra)
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cleopatra)

[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids, tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

[Hook]
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

[Outro]
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Part II]

[Segue]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid

[Verse 2]
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, that's right
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 1]
Babe, just say you miss me, is it that hard?
Too long since I've heard about our love
Am I in this by myself? Hey yeah
With rose colored lenses on my store bought frames
To see something other than these blues and grays
I need something different, hey yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you ain't feeling the same

[Hook]
Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat, yeah
Cubic's from genuine diamond, yeah
A call from the woman who loves you and hello from a friend
I know when it's real, I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh I know when it's real

[Verse 2]
Oh, I can tell the difference every time that you call
But I don't need a drink I need some time in my car
Time to drive and think, time to park and cry
You shoulda known you were beautiful
You shoulda known what I saw in you, yeah
Please forgive me for feeling like it's all your fault
A heavy heart can't carry blame for the loss

[Hook]
Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat, yeah
Cubic's from genuine diamond, yeah
A call from the woman who loves you and hello from a friend
I know when it's real, I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh I know when it's real

[Verse 3]
You might not know this but I'm a man with pride
And this hurts me baby deep down, deep down
I can't let go of this, gotta know I tried
It's pathetic baby don't lie, don't lie
I'm a candle, you're the sun
And you're burning baby, you're burning baby
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up, burning up, yeah

[Outro]
Pyrite from 24 karat yeah
Cubic's from genuine diamond yeah
A call from the woman who loves you
And hello from a friend
We'll never be more than friends
We'll never be..baby

I got all of this flick for the Lord's worship
You ain't slammin', got the Asperger's
I'ma drag that nigga, he deserve it
I'ma read his ass like a LaBeija (Drag)
Anna Wintour cool with my mama (True)
And it's winter fool, need a bomber
Plate of ravioli at Obama's, right, right, right
Can't you see I'm eating (What's poppin'?)
Wrist like ravioli, stuffed with diamonds, right, right?
We don't have the same problems
I get Raf Simons 'cause I'm gifted
That means sometimes I get it and don't even want it
Give Raf Simons when I'm giftin'
That means sometimes I give it, you know that you want it (Yeah)

Everyday we turn up party like the weekend
Come and take a picture in here
Money we'll be seeing
Er'day we turn up
Money we'll be seeing
Money,money we'll be seeing
Money,money we'll be seeing

If you love life put a hand up
Know some times you may break down
All in all and everything is cool
When you make moves and you paint towns
Have good drinks with good friends
When the city's borin' you take trips
They'll go with you to the end and back
And then catch you if you may slip
And then help you get back up
Reach for the stars and find your peak
Many nights of that great work
All I got was some bad sleep
But for all the nights that I stayed up
These the moments we prayed of
The ones that thought we wouldn't make it
Finally get to see what we made of
We paid up

[Verse 1]
I heard my teacher say that I'd be better off
If I just took what I've been given
They said I never know what to do
Unless I'm told
I feel underestimated, So unaccounted for
Then you want to call me to your office right after school
And tell me your version of my future

[Hook]
But let's take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don't talk me out of it
Don't talk me out of it
It's my life, Don't talk me out of my life
It's my life

[Verse 2]
I used to put an apple on Ms. Jacob's desk
But she never liked me
She said I'm gon' fail, no matter what I give
She said 'cause my skin wasn't light enough
Tuition wasn't high enough
I couldn't understand just what I did
So underestimated, You left me unaccounted for
Now you want to call me to your office right after school
And now you wanna tell me, your version of my future

[Hook]
But let's take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don't talk me out of it
Don't talk me out of it
It's my life, Don't talk me out of my life
It's my life

[Bridge]
Just tell me how
You're much better than me now
You tore me down till there was nothing left
Look at me, Look at me, Look at me, Look at me
I'm still standing
Look at me
Look at me now, Look me in my eyes

[Hook]
But let's take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"

[Verse 1]
Ever since you came into my life I been moving closer to
Tryna' build a vault around the both of us
When you're gone baby I ain't cool
No I ain't cool no, I can't move
And I don't know what the hell is happening to us
But I don't wanna know because it feels like something that I want
And baby I ain't never fell in love but if this is what they talk about then I don't ever wanna get up
They say it's infatuation
I say I don't care what you name it

[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

[Verse 2]
No I don't care who wants to question us or break us up
Cos' I'd lose a thousand friends for what I got wit you
Right here baby I'm all good, yup, I'm all good, ah
I'm all good, oh
And I don't want nothing but your heart and trust
Every little tender touch
And I know love ain't only made for us but I feel like we own it
Feel like we own it
And I already know what they say, they swear that we will never make it
But if I lost you today it'd be real just the same
[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

[Bridge]
Oh I know it all can't be just a figment of imagination
A dream that won't come true
I know it all can't be just and illusion
I know what you're doing to me

[Chorus]
Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know its real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for realNot funded by Gilead Sciences

[Verse 1]
Got a heart full of gold, that I own
The clothes on my back and a pencil
I can draw my own money
You wouldn't even tell the difference
But I just can't sketch the feeling
I get when you're not home
Or recreate the paintings
You've hung onto my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh but I bet they're worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I'm a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can't tell me nothing, nothing

[Chorus]
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can't buy what I got
Cause I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

[Verse 2]
She got a heart made of glass
What's inside of it's like lightning in a bottle
Now what would that be worth in your museum
Recently we traded
And now that hearts my own
And since we're sewed together
I feel like I got both

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and I bet they're worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I'm a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can't tell me nothing, nothing

[Bridge]
Time itself wants what I got
So I don't care about what you've got
All I know is my girl is precious
You make me better, baby
You make me happy, baby
Nobody needs to remind me exactly why I'm
The richest man in the room

[Chorus]
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can't buy what I got
Cause I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you

Cause they all want what I got

[Intro]
We in the studio
I said, we in the studio
Is this mic on? Check, check

[Verse 1]
I'm thankful for my position I was given in life
Cause I know some people living who ain't living this life
Read about starved children who ain't eating this right
Drug lords declare war, selling cheaper the price
Stunting dummy drug money, yeah them sneakers is nice
Get your swag from the blacks selling bags of the white
Niggas can't get a job, so we self-employed
If the coppers come a-knocking, we gon' help that boy
Bail money, welcome back home out of jail money
White girl pale money, sunny when we sell money
See seashell money, we sell money
Rain, hail money, heaven what the hell money
Dusty paper, stale money, I thought they restricted it
Did for most people but we out here getting it

[Hook]
Bunch of hands under her dress, we get the feeling that she's faded
And she's willing screaming Wolf Gang, whip me off, get me off
The sex, it turns to children, then the children turn to villains
Villain wolves screaming kill them all, fuck 'em all
And that go for anybody that come around here, that ain't from around here
Ho, you too, you ain't special, Wolf Gang kill them all, fuck 'em all
[Verse 2]
She handles herself with class
She got a nice ass but she can't run no games on me
She claim to like the stores and the clothes
Jeans bleached with the holes, but she can't get my bank homie
Too smart is no good, if she smart for no good
It's so good, she can't flaunt her thing on me
She can be full of swag, drive a Jag
Poppin' tags on the Ave but she can't get her cake from me
That sounded like the hook I threw at her and the swag I reeled her in
Said she came to feel me in, when she really came to fill me in
Like baby what's the deal with it? Seem to be attracted
By the fiancee and finance that no wifey concealin' it
Dealin' with life's shuffle, then fold
Dippin' with the duffles I hold, if we are a couple, let's go
To the place where we lead in the life to some sleep
Bring the pipe, blow the weed, punchlines to be received

[Hook]

[Intro: Sample]
"Three minutes forty five seconds and counting, we are still a go at this time"

[Verse 1]
Listening to Star Trek's star tracks
On the track to stars and back
Only after we get to the end

Passing planets feeling small
On the mattress floating off
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl

[Climb]
But you look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

[Hook]
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh

"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"

[Verse 2]
The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, Big bang, look at what we made beautiful

[Climb]
But you look good in that spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

[Hook]
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh

[Verse 3]
We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this eclipse oohh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no

[Hook x2]
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh

T minus 15 seconds, guidance is internal
12, 11, 10, 9, ignition sequence start
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, all engines running
Lift off, we have a lift off, lift off"

Listening to star trek, star tracks
On the track, starting back only after we get to the end
Parts and planets, feeling small
All the matches floating off
Help me breathe in out here tonight
Nothing new, nothing old, baby girl
But you look good in a space suit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus, it's easy to love you up here, up here

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We'll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket love

The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you lie, girl
They glow, they glow
Oh yeah, we were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, big bang, look at what we made beautiful
You look good in a space suit
I can't keep my hands off you
'Cause it's easy to love you up here, up here

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We'll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket love
We could make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this secret, so
If the lights go by that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us
No, no, no, no

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We'll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket love
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rocket burns, they burning
We'll be making love baby, rocket love
Rocket loveIt's another day in Los Angeles
Beverly Hills to be exact
Today, I decide to take my new Rolls-Royce Wraith
I leave my multimillion dollar mansion and blend in with the morning LA traffic
Usually being in traffic is not a pleasant experience
But when you drive a 260 plus thousand dollar car with a 6.6 liter twin turbo V-12, a 13 thousand dollar starlight headliner option, and complete sound isolation from the outside,
It's kinda hard to pay attention to what happens outside
I stop at a red light
Holding  the bespoke hand-stitch leather steering wheel with one hand
And adjusting the air conditioning to a cool 68 degrees
And I notice this guy in a third gen Honda Civic
He's staring at me
As soon as our eyes cross,
He looks else where
But I can see the look on his face
He's jealous
He wants a car like mine
His girlfriend is sitting right next to him
Pretending to look at her phone
But she is actually taking a picture of my car
I bet he told her to do so
The light goes green and I flow past them
Reaching 60 miles per hour in a mere 4.1 seconds
Not bad for something which costs as much as your house
I get to my destination in complete comfort
As it's always the case when you drive a Rolls-Royce
But to look good,
Its gotta be the latest model
Can't be seen driving around in a series 1 Phantom with the wrong fog lights
I mean,
You can buy those for less than a hundred grand,
That's like,
What I spent in two weeks

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you
Who else gon' believe in you? Who else gon' believe in you?
Believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you?
Who else gon' believe in you, who else gon' believe in you?

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Who else?
I knew all this back on the Shaw
When I had no bedrooms at all
Now it's tears in a wraith feeling soft
Now I'm based like I'm lost at a rave
Really miss my landaulet
Look at the stars, it's a plane
This plane right here cost me bank
That Bentley truck ugly, I'm straight
It's straight, but that's just not my style
That's just not my style
When Sage pushed it mongo
Way before the Uber
Was stranded as fuck at the house
We just landed we scuffing the ground
We been knew the earth was around
These goofies ain't looking for Mickey
They looking for mini me, copy my style
Copies is selling and I don't know why
Mostly I cockblock myself on the pop
400k I could spend it on lots
Can't pay for play Christmas day no Xbox
Last Christmas Day was in LA with Flack
Pourin' this red, sky gettin' blue
We couldn't tell if it's IMAX or not
Butterfly hinges on a cocoon

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors go dat way, doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors, Wraith, my doors, uh

[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

[Verse 1: Nas]
A known fraud once fell on his own sword
Scrawny as a fiend, he'll tell on his own broad
His lady's crazy and it bugs me
Behind her best friend back, she call her best friend baby ugly
Less then a week ago
He's beatin' his dick to a freak he know
Talkin' dirty to him on speakerphone
Right before he clinked up, his girl creeped up
Swung a knife, hit his cheekbone, made a deep cut
He holdin' his face, he out the door
She yellin' out the window, "You can stay with that whore"
Hours went past, stitched up with the gauze
Gettin' drunk by the store, smokin' blunts with some more
Fraud ass niggas who like to front and big talk
Never swung at nobody, never let a gun spark
Big nine-seven Benz with the old body
Pulls up to the corner, out jumps his old hottie

[Chorus: RaVaughn and Nas]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty (Nigga)
But they gon' know when they see us (Yo)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Football wives, basketball wives
Mistresses slash more tires with knives
They lookin' for a dollar
I'm lookin' for a JoAnne Chesimard to turn to a shotta
Spot a King of Diamonds, Onyx, one bitch get it off the floor
Other chick out of her man's pockets
What kind of shows you be watchin'?
It shows, this is how we choose who we should rock with
I think about settlin' down again, have more seeds
Ten toes on the ground again, let hoes be
Nothin' like makin' love with somebody you love
Nothin' like comin' home to grub
Netflix, hugs with a wet kiss
The best shit, take my mind off of makin' records
I need that moral support
Give me a reason to spoil you more
Make 'em jealous of who we are

[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

[Verse 3: Nas]
Tryna get my niggas legitimate
Shit is ugly, my dudes strugglin', drug dealer shit
Silhouette of a murderer, thug nigga, fitted Mets cap
Drunk liquor bit, young black militant
Just hopin' I hit a lick, a criminal's wit
Intelligence, still a menace each Guinness I sip
Bring the kid ideas, the visions I get
How this dude rich? He snuck in with no citizenship
Motivation, so I get off my ass
I'm the star of the movie, lookin' for my supportin' cast
Read the Forbes pages, lookin' at G4s
Wish it could be more, pray I beat the court cases
Women with small waists, lonely, I ain't too far
Smoke weed, and count paper
I'm about paper and pussy and buyin' the bar
Fly ass niggas, y'all jealous of who we are

[Chorus: RaVaughn]
Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (Cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (Penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (Poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (No), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

[Verse: Frank Ocean and James Sullivan]
Gonna be somebody, oh I follow
Oh and it's so cloudy
Running showers and the mist so fly
Enough time to know, know nothing at all
Oh I see the lines, there's two lines (walls)
You'll live a life anew
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, to be kind
You cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
Its a rush to the head
We've been here before (It's just like the water)
The first time is not the past time
I ain't felt this way in years
First, I was rushing for a wait
This time I'm waiting for a rush
(Oh, help me up off my feet)
Infatuation's your rush
(Help me, help me, help me off my feet, yeah
Do you....)
Keep pushing on 'em, never let 'em stop
All that happens to be, what happens to me, upon his feet
Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off and on
Bygones but we're still here, ride around in my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel
(What happens to me)
Bet you wish you was me
(You, just you and me)
(I need some help on my feet)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be up to my feet
I wake up feeling weak
Wake me up in a week
It don't matter
It don't matter, pipe it down
Two is a crowd, quieting down

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
What stays and what- what's gone and what's here still
And what's here still
Riding my two wheels
They're gone and you're still here, rid-
They're gone and you're still here, riding my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel


[Verse 1]
Turn a lamp on
Let me talk to you
See that light bulb, does something to you
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don't it?
Make it difficult to run and hide don't it?
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
Come close to me if that's you
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
The lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

[Chorus]
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

[Verse 2]
Just turn the lamp down
Don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Or gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
Took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blend in, too perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

[Chorus]
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

[Bridge]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirror oh you're so unfair to all of the beautiful ones

[Chorus]
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

[Verse 1]
Turn the lamp on, let me talk to ya
See that light bulb, does something to ya
Makes it little harder, to tell a lie don't it
Make it difficult, to run and hide don't it
Told your truth to me, the truth to me
Come close to me, if that's you
I wanna see the details
Inside those beautiful eyes (Beautiful eyes)

[Pre-Chorus]
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before
And I wonder
What on earth is he searching for

[Chorus]
No wonder why
There's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why
Your so terrified of beautiful

[Refrain]
Scared of the good
More than the evil
Scared of the light
More than the dark
Scared of a truth so much more than a lie
I'm scared for me
I'm scared of me
Scared of beautiful

[Verse 2]
Turn the lamp down, don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
I took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blame him to perfect
All this beauty ever came
It was reason for some beautiful life

[Pre-Chorus]
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before
And I wonder
What on earth is he searching for

[Chorus]
No wonder why
There's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why
Your so terrified of beautiful

[Refrain]
Scared of the good
More than the evil
Scared of the light
More than the dark
Scared of a truth so much more than a lie
I'm scared for me
I'm scared of me
Scared of beautiful

[Bridge]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
Mirror mirror oh your so
Unfair to all of the beautiful ones oh

[Chorus]
No wonder why
There's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why
Your so terrified of beautiful

[Refrain]
Scared of the good
More than the evil
Scared of the light
More than the dark
Scared of a truth so much more than a lie
I'm scared for me
I'm scared of me
Scared of beautiful

[Outro]
I'm scared of me
I'm scared of me
I'm scared of me
I'm scared to be beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful

[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (brave)
I'm not brave

[Verse 2]
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views (nice views)
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell (It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do?
(And the other side of the loop is a loop)
This, this fe-, this feel
This feel, this feels
This feels how molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel, this feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel

[Bridge]
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (brave)

[Verse 3]
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot

[Verse 4]
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon (In the dark)

[Outro]
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for

[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
(I'd rather live outside)
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm a fool (?)
Maybe I should move
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (Brave)
I'm not brave (Mind out here)
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool

[Verse 2]
Living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move
Maybe, two kids and a swimming pool
Two kids and a swimming pool (I'm not brave)
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell
Other side of the moon

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
(Speaking of Nirvana, it was there)
I be dreaming a dream in a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot-

[Verse 1]
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

[Chorus]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

[Chorus]
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control

[Chorus]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, yeah, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

[Outro]
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, y'know you got it, yeah
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
(Keep a place for me, for me)
You're spitting game, y'know you got it, yeah
(I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing)
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
(It's nothing, yeah, it's nothing, keep a place for me, for me)
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
(Keep a place for me, for me)
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
(It's nothing, yeah, it's nothing)
You're spitting game, y'know you got it, yeah
(It's nothing, yeah, it's nothing)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (Denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (Black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (On the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (Brown cock)
Last night I slept over hers (Over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

[Chorus: Frank Ocean and Tyler, The Creator]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)
I just wanna talk and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
He's at your window

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous

[Verse 1]
Her state of mind is constantly changing
To hell and back
She drives, switching lanes
Not knowing what she has til she knows where she's going
If she can just get past this traffic
She tries and tries to find peace of mind
But these days everything's in your face
So she stays soul and in her mind
Blowin' smoke in the sky
Cause it's her only vice
I wonder why

[Hook]
She blows smoke in the air, in the air, in the air
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

She shaved off all of her hair, of her hair, of her hair
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

[Verse 2]
Some people seem to think she needs changing
They don't know the struggles that she was raised with
So shut the fuck up
Just shut the fuck up
Stop thinking that you know everything
You don't and you never will, so just let it go
And be free as long as you're kind and and you've been born with the fight
So don't wonder why

[Hook]
She blows smoke in the air, in the air, in the air
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

She shaved off all of her hair, of her hair, of her hair
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck
Cause she don't give a fuck, no

[Verse 1]
My best friend
What was cooler than us?
Whole school already knew what it was
Kiddy crushing, puppy loving, no
Ah, you are my high school wifey
College made it different
I stayed at home and you didn't
You got a scholarship to Michigan State
Drove my heart two-thousand miles away

[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't

[Verse 2]
My best friend, wish I could have went with her
Can't afford to visit her
Let alone stay
But I wanna, I really wanna
Oh, we did everything together, now I'm missing all the silly shit
The way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed
I'm x-ing off the calendar days
I'm praying, oh, you come back again

[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her

[Bridge]
My baby (baby), what am I to do without her?
Whoa I've been losing patience calling her
[Pre-Hook]
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

[Hook]
Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't

[Verse 1]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Woah)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noe, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin' (Fightin')
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Yeah)
Clips on clips like Mike (Hello)
It's really all

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

[Outro]
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home

[Intro]
Woo! (Woo, woo)
Woo!

[Verse]
I was in all them hours in it
10K, tokin' mid strokes
Prime prime time of my life witcha
Puttin' prime numbers up though
On them 777 flights witcha
Take a shower with it, gotta cleanse it
Keep the safety off innit
Now we finna have a mini
Outta wedlock, God forgive it
Then forget it
'Cause only God can forget it
All this hotel living
Might as well pay the mortgage what I'm spending
Said the dick long as a swan neck
Put some real swans in the pond then
Fell asleep in the foreign
After the free show at the Garden
Let the LED roll, deer hunter
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Bet we sell the biggest out next week
On me on, my partners
[Outro]
When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm sideways, yeah, I set me straight
When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm down they gon' celebrate
Sittin' sideways, too sideways
Nah, it's not too late

[Verse 1]
(We're spendin' too much time alone)
Spendin' too much time alone
(And I just ran outta Trojans)
Horses gallop to her throne
(We're behaving like teenagers)
We're behaving like teenagers
(Making less than minimum wage)
Still inside our parents' homes
(No, I don't live in Denver)
No, I don't live in Denver
(I grew up in Sierra Leone)
And her pink skies will keep me warm
Sierra Leone
Sierra Leone

[Verse 2]
Tid bits of intuition that I be gettin' abandon mission
(Sierra Leone)
Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different
Shit feelin' too good to me
Glistening, shimmerin' underneath the sunlight, the sunlight
(Sierra Leone)

[Outro]
And a new day will bring about the dawn
And a new day will bring another crying babe into the world
(Girl now)
Our daughter's reaching for your nipple 'cause it's time for her to eat (Reaching for ya)
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle if it's time to go to sleep (Oh, go to sleep, oh, oh)
I'll sing a Lennon lullaby, she can have a pretty dream
Baby girl, if you knew what I know, knew what I know
[Outro]
Na, na na, na na, na...
Na, na na, na na, na...

[Intro]
It's simple, so simple

[Verse 1]
These hands that I pray with for just one more chance
They also took off the dress of that woman
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems
A simple, simple mistake
Simply made it so hard for you to love me

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Interlude]
My mother said "son, don't break her heart
And staying in love won't be so hard, it's simple"

[Verse 2]
These same lips that once said I love you, I do, I do
Admitted, they kiss her over and over and over
Simple man, couple simple problems
One simple, simple mistake
Simply made it hard for you to love me
[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Bridge]
I wish I could've simply say I'm sorry, baby ooooh
I wish you'd say you simply can't fall out of love with me
Then maybe we could move one (cause I really can't)
Move on (I gotta)
Get on (I gotta)
Get on with our hearts
With ours lives, cause they're simply too short
Without love

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Verse 1]
This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your metal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
'Til God strikes us
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fucking, underneath moonlight now
Pretty fucking, sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, haze)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication
Strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you come when I call again?

[Verse 2]
On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
Piece in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away
Because I'm stronger and the Congo is dim (smoke)
In comes the morning (smoke)
In comes the morning (haze)

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D (Star Trak)
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, (what?) now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Me? I'm from the slums, niggas who push a ton
Ton of drums, with foul flow, dirty mouth, like kissing bums
Mama done made her one, um, a witty son
With no respect for women, so show me your titties hun (what?)
You eighteen? Me? I'm twenty-somethin'
OK, I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit, it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, "Should he come?"
I'ma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, um, that mac and cheese
New 'Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics ("How's your dick?") Shit, how's your knees?
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee
I came up with ''Rella'', ain't touch a bag of weed
Shit was doper than Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, ay
Getting T.U., O.F., indeed
We was missing Sweatshirt, like "Where's the hooded sleeve?"
Okay, nevermind, we found him, yeah

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Guess I win, checks started cashing in
I stop rapping and start asking where my fucking passion is
Probably where that faggot went (who?) Tyler talking father problems
Shocking shit, he spit to popping topics in them gossip columns
I ain't ask for this, I did it out of boredom
Thought that roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom
Now; Ye's, PJs, sipping leche
Chips Ahoy, boy, listening to "Cowboy", ay!
Boy, land in Melbourne and skate to Fitzroy, ay!
AUS was awes', I enjoyed, boy
Y'all niggas played as a tot's toy
Have a good day as I annoy, oi

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Canons with panorama views
My shoes that seen more vans than Mexicanas
Or crackers in Alabama
G-O-to-the-L-F, this OF
I opened up a store so I don't stress
But nigga, I (what?) mosh in gardens
Jazz punk shit, playing chords
Making up shit, pardon my Dolly Partons
And I keep shartin'
Hoodies with rectangles and different colors
Niggers think I started kindergarten

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Frank Ocean and Both]
My bitch is on my handle bars
I, just, wanna, ride, my bike
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
Hair blowing in the wind
My bitch is on my handle bars
I, just, wanna, ride, my bike
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars (Handle bars)
Hair blowing in the wind (Ooohh)
Her freckles look like candy bars (Shit)
My cool summer never ends (Cool)
My bitch is on my handle bars
Yeah (Bars, bars)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Oh my God, seriously? Mister Cool Guy, haha
You're talking to a fucking bike, loser!
Hehe, oh fuck!

Do you slide on all your nights like this?

Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (Uh)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Put that spotlight on her face (Spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (Ah, yeah)
We gon' pipe up and turn up (Pipe up)

My diamonds gon' shine when the lights dark (Shine)
You and I take a ride down the boulevard (Yeah)
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good lord

[Verse 3: Offset]
(Offset!) Good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out a spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia (Info)
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo
She havin' it, went to college, workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average (M's)
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it (Skrr)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Smile at you (smile) I got my eyes on you (eyes)
I wanna climb on you
Can I ride with you? (can I?) touch the sky with you? (phew)
A-huh-huh-huh-huh
Say the place and we go where you wanna go (where?)
She say Rodeo, I say I'm thinking 'bout Tokyo (Tokyo)
With the top gone, won't turn up the stereo (stereo)
Singing every word of my song that's on radio (aye)
I'ma roll one, I know that you don't smoke (I know)
Sit back, let your mind float (phew) never give up hope (no)
And if ya got a problem, let me know (let me know)
I try my best to keep you close
The life we in, no boss to match 'em on the ropes (ooh)
If I'm top ten, to win, I gotta be the GOAT (GOAT)
I feel like when I step in (what?) gotta make an announcement
But y'all know (but y'all know)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear

[Intro]
Gotta rinse off here
I can't see your diamonds
I need a week paradise
I went god mode all year
I can't see so cloudy
Paradiso laundries
I keep the cheats on all year
Sometime in Heaven
You still behind like ancestor
All on your mood board all year
I went god mode about it
You ain't got no muscles, lil' nigga
I ain't in the mood for it all year
I keep the cheats on always
Wrong side of average

[Chorus]
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on or peace out on me, yeah, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, ohh, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
For your mentality
You play ball, you run 5 on 5 least three times a week
Glen Park down the street
Waitin' on you to tire, retire with victory
Play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose you don't cry but you lowkey sad to see
If we cut like some champions you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-haha, smiling
I'm still working while you dream pop
I could never let a scene stop smilin' on me
I don't think they get the point pop
They forgettin' that it's me, akh
Akhi tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day running numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall
They're like "something's gotta give"
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather
If you ain't in the streets you can't see the sky, I'm out here
I could see the sky and it's paradise
On the regular
[Chorus]
And when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on, ohh slide, yeah, yeah
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
First time on me, ohh, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way
This is for that night when setbacks won't let that much fade
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
See you peepin' out the peep hole
Gamblin' with your life, nigga, Cee-Lo
Three stripes and they're all green gold
Three strikes in a row mean go
And you die slow, oh
Nigga, die slow
I screamed when I saw the titties on Janet Jackson
I'm screamin' from the top of the planet
They first saw my swag, they was laughin'
But my bitch bad, she leavin' damage
I'm higher than a mothafuckin' ladder
I'm ballin', I'm ballin' on all you scrubs
Got you ridin' in your foreign, you livin' it up
Front's 21's and the back's on them dubs
Jeffery got a mink on, he look like a cub
Ridin' in the Rozay away from the world
Oasis on and I'm feelin' a grudge
Oasis on when I'm seein' you girl
Oasis on and I'm seein' the dust
Oasis on and I'm feelin' like water
Oasis on when I'm servin' the plugs
Oasis on when I'm servin' these drugs
Off white molly, I sniff it off her
All of y'all on hold on while I tangle my buzz
All white hoes puttin' dick in their guts
All type of hoes puttin' dick in their guts
Bad black hoes, they drinkin' the cum
Told her when she cum I wanna drink a lil' some
Molly bite down, man, I need me some gum
Cop me a Sudan I'ma gon' turn up a bomb
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on peace out, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
For your mentality you play ball
You run 5 on 5 least three times a week

[Outro]
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way
This is for that night when set backs won't let that much fade
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Gold chain and some J's like Nas in Illmatic
I'm so real, I'm something to feel, peel fabric
My folks kill, they hunt every meal, meat cabbage
Lyrically get out my way, protein the beats radish
Roll the weed LB the police smell me
High profile, sweet, bring them hoes to the tele Nah
Bitches fuck your shit up words from DMX in Belly behind you back
Planning your downfall, I thought that was your relly-
Relative, skin of ribs and eat healthy
I belch a bitch and leave her tits on a shelving
I felt a bitch, she let me in, welcoming
Fuck duct tape nigga, I like Velcro-ing
I ain't the one to be tampered with
I make you shit all in your pants and your pamper, bitch
Niggas quick to sing a hook and make a dance up quick
For you it's never or never, my camp's legit

[Interlude]
Wolf Gang! Fuck your crew, nigga! This Wolf Gang, nigga!
Go the fuck home, mutherfucker! Night night, mother fucker!
Smoke up, Left Brain!

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Snow so white, moon so bright
They're on a playground making canines fight
Ain't no place for my kids to go
[Verse 2]
The wolves are rowdy and in the parking lot
I don't mean basketball when I say that they be balling in the park a lot
It's like the big bad wolf duplicated
If they getting shitted on by critics, it's cool, they super rated
Life on the huge and playlist, daily's the fucking basis
Accounting for all the hatred, get off the children's sacred
I'm international, actual but in fact I go from
The US to the UK to Amsterdam in like two days

[Hook]
Snow so white, moon so bright
They're on a playground making canines fight
Ain't no place for my kids to go

[Verse 1]
I'm afraid to say it
Don't wan't you to think I'm playing
My mistakes take the pretentiousness down like I'm standing naked in a crowd
And I'm sorry I know that I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong
If I could I'd go back I'm exposed give me back my clothes cause I just can't take it
But look at you, loving a fool, making it easy
I guess its cool naked with you already seen me

[Chorus]
Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
You don't mind them flaws, you've already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable

[Verse 2]
You keep on forgiving
Rewrote all my wrongs in pencil
When you stay it makes me forget that I'm down, now it's all so simple
'Til the end, even when, I look dumb like I do when I lie
Feels so good letting go, I'm exposed, you can have my clothes cause I'm not afraid
But look at you loving a fool, making it easy
I guess it's cool, naked with you already seen me

[Chorus]
Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
You don't mind them flaws, you've already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable
[Bridge]
It don't matter, it don't matter no, you've seen it all before
It don't matter, it don't matter, you've seen it all before
It don't matter, it don't matter no, you've seen it all before
So comfortable, so comfortable, so comfortable

[Chorus]
Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
You don't mind them flaws, you've already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable

[Intro]
Oh no
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
So fresh (so fresh) oh yes
And I, know I was in love with you
First moment I met you, butterflies
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt
First word that I spoke it made you smile
Cause I got a little style goin'
You laugh in my face but I didn't care
Cause it started the conversation
That led to our first date, now
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt it
I know it's true if, they're, just like you

[Chorus]
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
Each time when I closed my eyes
Fade in and your lips touch mine, oh
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
You're like my favorite
I swear you could play forever...

[Skit: Frank Ocean]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow

[Verse 1]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (solo), solo (solo)
S-solo (solo), s-solo, (solo)

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

[Verse 2]
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

[Outro]
By myself
Solo, solo, solo, solo
(By myself, by myself)
(Solo)

[Intro: Andre 3000]
Ayy, ayy, so now I'm-

[Verse: Andre 3000]
So low that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So low that I don't get high no more
When I "Geronimo!," I just go "Heh"
Solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So low that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, ant
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling, this only worsens
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
Don't pay no attention to it
So low that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
Watchin' the summer come close to an end
After twenty years in, I'm so naive I was under the impression
That everyone wrote they own verses
It's comin' back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
I've stumbled and lived every word
Was I working just way too hard?That's right. Now tell these motherfuckers, um, what the house warming party gone feel like. 'Cause I feel like we need it to be about, umm, large picture, wide-frame, panoramic views, and above 78 degrees, 'cause we don't do that cold shit. This is for the sun-lit motherfuckers in the building, this is for the bitches who like to wear, um, nothing but skin and,-and-and loose fitting things, like a sundress. This is for motherfuckers who like, uh, shit that ain't sepia but that's bronze like a motherfucking, uh, tan you can't get from a bottle, you broke bitch. This is for blonde, uh-uh, nature walks and shit. This is for that blonded bitch.

[Intro]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
How would you have learned if I ain't leave?
I guess I was way too naive
I should've been checked you
But I let you get mad disrespectful, huh
Couldn't be serious nigga was you?
Looking at my new man, wish it was you?
But you're dead now
Sign of the cross on ya chest and ya head now
Guilty is what you pled now
Left Queens, hit Brooklyn, I'm on a belt now
Stupid is what you felt now
When you see me on TV, have a meltdown
B-b-b-bombs away
Tryna sneak tip hit me when slimes away
Rollie on, but I ain't got time of day
Time'll tell, Chanel, get that Lagerfeld, nigga

[Pre-Hook and: Mario]
Now I'm alone, said she wanna be ghost, yeah
I don't really like it, but I gotta take it
Damn, damn, damn, girl
When you coming back?
So you never coming back? Yeah
I-I don't believe that
But right now I gotta accept the fact yeah

[Hook: Mario]
You left me for somebody else now
I wish I never loved ya
You left me, baby you left me
Girl I can't stop thinking 'bout you
You left me for somebody else girl
Girl I wish I never met you
You left me, baby you left me

How many cars on the drive are actually yours?
You never go out for a ride, you keep them indoors
You got a big big mouth, a big big house
You're the king of cribs right now

A real big hit, no hard shit
I swear that won't change me one bit
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me

Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

The world will still go on without you
The newspapers still talk about you
And if your ever low, pick up the phone
I'll be 'round, don't tell a soul

Cause I'm not you, you're bullet proof
I'm in a crowd and I can't move
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me

Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

Let me in, let me in
Gimme the sunshine all year 'round
Lemme out, lemme out
Gimme it now, hear me out, hear me shout

Gimme the munchies , show me around
Lemme out, lemme out, gimme the reason
Gimme it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Gotta big big house, big big mouth
Big, big, house, big, big mouth
Big, big, house, big, big mouth
That's not helping me right now

Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Haha
When I was younger, I used to wonder, like...

[Verse 1]
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, "Girl, don't be dumb-
I'm riding shotgun"

[Pre-Chorus]
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

[Chorus]
And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Shit, oh well, oh well," ha
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me..."
[Post-Chorus]
You'd be singin' to her
Like, "La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da"

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me

[Chorus]
Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Okay, I don't believe it"
I say "Nope, I swear, I never do it"
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend"

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah
(Ooh, ooh, ah) Ooh, ah
Yeah
Fair enough

[Bridge]
Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair
But it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half
Ah, ah
I'm singing, "La-da, da-da" 'bout heartbreak
And now, I'm singing, "La-da, da-da" 'bout love lost

[Break]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Damn
Haha
I'm saying though, like...
All I write is love songs
I mean, I try
I come to the studio
I-you know what I do
What you think I do it for? Huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listening, never
But if you were...
Might bug with it
Haha, yeah
All these songs for women
Songs for women
Songs for you, baby
For you

[Cassettes changing]

Four 4's I'm tippin'
Wood grain I'm grippin'
Catch me lane switchin' with the paint drippin'
Turn yo' neck and your dame missin'
Me and Slim we ain't trippin'
I'm finger flippin' and syrup sippin'
Like Do or Die I'm po' pimpin'
Car stop rims keep spinnin'
I'm flippin' drop with invisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shakin' the block with four 18s
Candy green with 11 screens
My gasoline always supreme
Got Doe-Doe the brown with a pint of lean
It takes a grinda to be a king
It takes a grinda to be a king
First round draft pick comin'
Who is Mike Jones? comin'
Slab shining with the grill and woman
Slab shining with the grill and woman
I'm Mike Jones who Mike Jones
The one and only
You can't clone me
Got a lot a haters and a lot of homies
Some friends and some phony
Back then hoes didn't want me
Now i'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me
Now i'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me
Now i'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me
Now i'm hot hoes all on me

[Second Half]

The player on the side
Keep it fair, fair
Let them both know that each one is there, there
So my conscious
Be clear where I stay (Stay)

[Verse 1]
I'm standing by your locker
In the hallway after class
Swear I'm amazed, yeah
The drawing in my binder
Every picture I put a halo on your head

[Pre-Hook]
I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

[Hook]
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

[Verse 2]
Saturdays I'm at the snow cone spot
Trying to guess your favorite flavor
I'm thinking cotton candy, maybe
I bought it and I placed it on the table next to me
I wish you could taste it
Cause it's surely melting

[Pre-Hook]
I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

[Hook]
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still

[Bridge]
While the rain storm takes over, outrageous baby
I'll be standing here, seconds forward
I'll take it later, I'll be right there
Oh no, matter what I'll be here
However long

[Hook]
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

[Intro]
They look like twins

[Intro]
La da da da daaaa (Okay...cause it never felt like that)

[Verse 1]
Baby, I don't really know which way to go
It's like your energy keep callin'
I, Im bout to lose my self composure
Even sex has got me braggin'
And You, you look so good
I wish you would give me what Im looking for
Touch is so electric
Got my heart racing. Pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front. I'll be there 1 on 1
And you're the one I want girl

[Hook]
You're like static
It's way beyond me girl, its like magic
Got me feenin' for your touch like an addict. Gotta have it
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would
You're like static
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would

[Verse 2]
And I ain't even playing girl
Theres so much truth in what Im saying girl
You got my head all in it. Like a game of chess baby check me
This ain't no first date. Don't hesitate. No ??
And Ima take it nice and slow, yeah. Take your body where it needs to go
Give me what Im looking for. Touch is so electric
Got my heart racing. Pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front, I need the 1 on 1
You're the one I want, girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Doin' 85 on a freeway. Switchin' lanes in my "range"
GPS is saying next exit. I got your text message
I'm on my way to you. Here's what were gonna do
And girl I'll take it to you. Fit closer, don't stop
Don't mess up the flow. Don't be scared
Touch right there. Make it personal
I don't really know what it is that you do
Its like a force, im stuck onto you like static

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
My baby, my sweet pumpkin pie
My honey, my darling, my love
I only really miss him when he's gone
Cause when we're together we argue two thirds of the time
And I miss him more than a fraction when we part

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh you're calling me crazy
Saying I'm always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You're packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I'm screaming get out

[Chorus]
But don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I say that you should leave but don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Sugar bunches of oats
My buttered toast on the side
My full serving of love
And then it's like
Whenever it's just me and you
You know I don't wanna fight
But I know that you know my buttons
And when to press them, baby, dammit

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh you're calling me crazy
Saying I'm always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You're packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I'm screaming get out

[Chorus]
But don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I say that you should leave but don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Bridge]
I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
You gotta leave

[Verse 3]
Boy, you know I bet the sun won't set
Before we go at it again
It's just gon' happen
I don't understand it
My heart's sane
But my mind's going crazy

[Chorus]
But don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I say that you should leave but don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Outro]
I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
I want you to leave
Oh, just go
No stay, go
Stay, go, stay, go, stay

mind is pretty blank right now. i'm sitting in my kitchen listening to age of consent by new order. i like this song.. i fuck with that gwen stefani song 'cool' too, i never knew 3000 played keyboards on it- sounds like some teen coming of age movie. i used my birthday week pass to stay in my apartment for too long.. sit still and catch up on some information. i saw that movie 'glengarry glen ross' and 'bottle rocket', 'pi', 'blackfish' (sea world is the devil), 'this is the end' (hahaha), 'the purge'(smh), some funny horror movie i forgot the name of '...' . my homie in aussie suggested that i read 'mr. norris changes trains'.. the writing was really nice. i read 'the new jim crow' it made me not fuck with humans for an hour. oh and 'diffficult men' which talked about great tv ..dexter, the wire, the sopranos, breaking bad and whatnot. i didn't watch any news or read it ...figured all that shit was gonna happen either way. i'm back to work these days.

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
My money burn
Synonymous to treatment of the fuzzy herb, I keep it G
In places you wishing you and your niggas be
Salute the gang, bitches cheer loud for the winning team
Bring it home, pull it out, break it down, roll it up
Smell it while we rolling down the street, you niggas know it's us
We got that fire, man you niggas know what's up
King Zag papers, Juan the only nigga rolling blunts
Other than that, you lame niggas is wack
Smoking on a J, while I'm smoking on a track
Cliche shit, stay way way far from basic
Kush cologne, I wear mines no K-Swiss
Damn, all I get is high; and brains
From a long-haired mistress preferred skinning light
Prejudice, marijuana evidence
Pipes, bong, vapes got me blown out my element, element

[Hook: Hodgy]
Every single day I smoke (smoke)
Every single day I smoke (I smoke)
Every single day I smoke
Every single day I smoke
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the greenback)
I get high, I get high (Grams of the green sacks)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I grasp my intoxication, digital cinema
Third dimension, I can't move, verb suspension
Putting my lips to the purp, hemp burns is tempting
Bitches in the studio and we copped about a quarter
On the phone with her dad, I'm getting high with his daughter
Euphoria, mouth cotton, percent? A hundred
Many places I go or I have went, I'm blunted
Weed, you got it, I want it, I want it if you got weed
T, T-H, H-H, H-C
Out of no eyes, I'm so high, hashish I can provide
In your life, you gotta pick it up, cause I have no ride
When you arrive, I'll be outside loitering
I hate potheads who front like they don't blaze it
Your body needs Mary Jane, nigga, it craves it
I welcome Mary Jane, she doesn't violate
Inhale, exhale, feel the vibe-er-ate

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator and (Frank Ocean)]

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
When we were kids
We handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious
Then
I'm still kicking
I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting
All the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb
Comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear
I've loved
I've loved the good times here
I've loved our good times here

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Say hello, then say farewell
To the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we?
Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, oh
Even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear
That I have loved
I have loved the good times here
And I will miss our good times here

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Spaceships are lifting off
Of a dying world
And millions are left behind
While the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I
Only you, goodbye
Goodbye

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be grey
Without you, I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time

(*alarm clock*)

[Cassette tapes changing]

[Verse 1]
I told her that I missed her, put her on a plane
Goyard luggage, just a product of the fame
I told her that I dug her, I wasn't running game
And if she left a nigga, I wouldn't be the same
She met me at the W, she grabbed me by my chain
Then kissed me like she meant it, so glad she came
Told me she was in love, she wasn't running game
And since she got off the plane, she didn't feel the same

[Pre-Hook]
I made a change for my baby, a difference for love
And I ain't frontin', feel like you were the one
That got the ring, girl if you want
Could have my name, girl if you want

Feel like you let me shy and wasn't feeling them at all

Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love

[Verse 2]
Summer lovin' in the winter, flaming in the rain
The only one I'm into, never gonna change
Cause when I said I dug her, I wasn't running game
Since she been rocking with me, the crush has been insane
She's a 1 of 1, D color VVS stone
My precious you're my everything, no please don't leave me lone
She told me she was so sprung, I never was a lame
And that the feelings so good, she wish that it would stay

While you're looking at me (at me)
I hope that he don't think that he is the only man

[Pre-Chorus]
When you sleeping at night, she's creeping out
It's not you it's sex that she's worried about

[Verse 2]
Her body's fierce, she's like scorpion
Her body said get over here
If I knew she had a man
I can't lie, I still would hit it
But I don't really understand
How you blind and you can't see it

[Pre-Chorus]
When you sleeping at night, she's creeping out
It's not you it's sex that she's worried about

[Chorus]
Tryna cuff her, cuff her

And someone's gonna break your heart

[Verse 1]
My right hand to God
Left hand holding the jewels
And I'm swearing up and down
I'm cursing out the moon
Tide stole my youth
The creases in my brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun's burning black and blue
Too cold this side of June

[Refrain 1]
It ain't natural

[Verse 2]
Right hand in yours
Left hand holding the juice
When that jungle flower blooms
Better leave it in the ground
Don't try to cut it out
The creases in your brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun burned black and blue on your green eyes
Too cold this side of June

[Refrain 2]
That ain't natural

[Bridge]
I'll rebel, I'll rebel
But this ain't natural
I'll take care, I'll take care
If this ain't going well
I'm no match for you
This isn't hard to tell
That it ain't going well

[Verse 3]
When we're under the palm trees
Thinking heaven must be
Somewhere under these palm trees
With all the hell we're raising
At least we had the palm trees
To shade us from the ray beams
But not even the palm trees
Could save us from the flames
Summer remains
Oh, summer remains
Oh yeah, summer remain
Summer remain

[Verse 1]
My right hand to God
Left hand holding the jewels
And I'm swearing up and down
I'm cursing out the moon
Tide stole my youth
The creases in my brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun's burning black and blue
It's too cold this side of June

[Refrain 1]
It ain't natural

[Verse 2]
Right hand in yours
Left hand holding the juice
When that jungle flower blooms
Leave it in the ground
Better not cut it out
The creases in your brow ain't (yours)
Saltwater swole my eyes (yours)
The sun burned black and blue on your green eyes (yours)
Too cold this side of June

[Refrain 2]
It ain't natural

[Outro]
(Right hand in yours)
I'll be right (yours)
I'll take (right)
(Yours)
Right (yours)
Right (yours)
Right (yours)
Yours, yours

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into
And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded, I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
See, it seems that

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like, um

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
I'm coming back, I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
I'll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
When you parade my homecoming, don't cry
You know I can't live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I'd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please, palm, no marijuana trees
Your hickeys on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I'm playing surfboarder, put whiskey in that salt water
I emptied every canteen
Just to wear that straight-edge varsity you think's cool
They called me soft in high school, thank God I'm jagged
Forgot you don't like it rough, I mean, he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean, how anal am I gon' be when I'm aiming my gun?
And why's his mug all bloody? That was a three-on-one
Standing ovation at Staples, I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit, I'm not supposed to be stunting
It's all melodic, this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep, but I'm just jet-lagged is all
And restless

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you's a little different I don't like you a lot
I mean... fuck

[Outro: Both, Frank Ocean, Earl Sweatshirt]
I don't know what we're about
What good is West Coast weather if you're bi-polar?
If I'ma need this sweater, I'd rather be where it's cold
Where it snows, I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls, I know they're coming in droves
You'll only miss when it goes
Yeah, I think that's it
When it goes

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

[Bridge: Beyonce and (Frank Ocean)]
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, like a bear
A tough love

[Chorus: Beyonce and Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower

[Bridge: Beyonce and (Frank Ocean)]
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Oh, like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, too much to bear
(Superpower)

[Chorus: Beyonce and Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we got plenty power
Nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

[Outro: Beyonce and (Frank Ocean)]
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Close your eyes to what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny-gnashing
Caddy-smashing, bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup

[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
'Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my hand
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Real love, ain't that something rare
I'm searching for a real love, talking 'bout real love
Real love, yeah
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Talkin' 'bout a real love



Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines

[Verse 1:]
I didn't notice the signs
You covered both of my eyes
(Mix-match text messages, voicemail evidence)
The audience yellin', "damn, she's blind"
Now it's all so clear
And I was also not scared
(Now I know she missed stunt double skipped on it)
Audience kept yellin', "Not the space

[Pre-Hook:]
I could say that I knew the whole time, but I would be lyin'
You'd have to be a hidden camera, recordin' each take of cryin'
I would say that I would just go to your part, to stop the taping
But the end's here, and I can't change it

[Chorus:]
So I laugh, cuz you think I'm finished
You don't know I've set up an suprise ending
In love, sometimes you don't win it
You just don't go messing up the suprise ending
The suprise ending

[Verse 2:]
You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
(Guess you kept missin' it, homeboys visitin')
The audience yellin', "yeah, that's right"
And now it's not so clear
You don't know how you missed me
Don't buy you were gone
Stopped goin' through your phone
The audience yellin', "'bout damn time"

[Pre-Hook:]
I could say that I knew the whole time, but I would be lyin'

You just don't go messing up the suprise ending

[Bridge:]
Everything was okay when I was the victim
Had me made out to be so naive
Never knew I was workin' on a masterpiece
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah
I worked on my grand finale, yeah
So now as the credits roll
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds

[Chorus:]
So I laugh, cuz you think I'm finished
You don't know I've set up an suprise ending
In love, sometimes you don't win it
You just don't go messing up the suprise ending

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
The suspense is buildin'
Sittin' on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickenin'
I was hangin' off the cliff, love
You said it's a surprise, what's the surprise ending?

[Verse 2: Brandy]

[Verse 1]
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

[Verse 2]
The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life
[Pre-Chorus 2]
A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born (Yeah)
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach?
The sweet life

[Bridge]
And the water is exactly what I wanted (Ah)
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy, ahh

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

[Verse 1]
That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see 'em
And I've got this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off these shoes and swim good, swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, swim good
Good...

[Verse 2]
Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD
Memory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference?
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze
Ever since I lost my baby
I've had this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile 'til the road runs out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off these shoes and swim good, swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, swim good

[Bridge]
I'm going off
Ahh, don't try stopping me
I'm going off
Ahh, don't try saving
No flares, no vest
No fear, waves washing me out

I'm about to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off these shoes and swim good, swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, swim good

[Intro]
Damn, you hungry
I mean, its cool, want some more?

[Verse 1]
I built us a little gingerbread house
You said you loved it, I baked you a little
Gingerbread Benz, and you said you dug it
I make stacks and stacks of cake in the bank, bank
You ate through 'em, you ate through 'em
You ate through 'em, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
When I re-up, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you
Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweety, you tell me now that your craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby

[Verse 2]
We took chartered flights
All around to taste those malls that
You like most, said the jefe food taste like pink raspberry
Good credit, A1, just like that sauce
Said you liked Ruth's Chris way better
Lean back my seat, watch your head go down
[Chorus]
Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
When I re-up, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you
Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweety, you tell me now that your craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing

[Bridge]
I know that your going to
Love me as long as your fed, you said
But I like you around
Just want to keep you here
I got to know girl, I ain't running out
I ain't running out

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweetie, you tell me now that your craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing
[Outro]
Hey baby, I've noticed you eat your jewellery for break
Hey baby, noticed you eat your jewellery for break

Give me my power
Give me my power
Give me my power
Give me my power
I built this city

[Verse 1]
I got plenty concrete, plenty steel
Please give me my trees, give 'em back
Give me tourists, give me traffic
Give me noise, just give it back
Could you bring back all my police, give me order
Turn back on my lights, give me fuel and water
I think I'm begging, cause now that everything's gone
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
With the streets all dark, it looks like my buildings are gone

[Hook]
I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city
Gave you, power over, power over me
Give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more
[Verse 2]
Tell the government, please give me funding
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?
Give me floodgates, give me levees
Too much water can you push it back
How you just gon' leave me out of order
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
I know I'm begging, cause now that everything's dried up
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
And with the streets all dark, the buildings look lost

[Hook]
I made you the mayor of my town honey
I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city, all power over, power over me
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

[Bridge]
We used to be sky high

BUT WE OUT HERE.


Yeah, it's real simple bitch
You understand me?
Bitch I'm a player now
Your main bitch works for me
Yeah. Yeah
I haven't worn a shirt since 1993
That's the year I moved my operation to the beach
Half a dozen cameras on me when I'm in the streets
Pop, pop!
Hit out on me
Building mansions on the sand
Your girl looks like Kelis
She must hate you so much right now
She must hate you so much right now
Run my fingers through her hair
My girl looks like Kelis
Man she must love me so...

[Verse 1]
Sid: This is my once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Felt the morning sun and knew that
This was my once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Even got a kiss from you
I feel like hoppin' up and down
Like a kangaroo
Jumpin' fences, climbin' trees
What pleases me is what I'll do, 'cause

[Chorus]
This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Everyone's entitled to be wild
Be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year
This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Once a year we're jumping fences
This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Once a year we lose our senses

[Verse 2]
Look at Charlie up a tree
Kissin' Katie's ear
Charlie's wife is mad as hell

[Chorus]
Oh well it happens once a year
And this is that once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Everyone's entitle to be wild
Be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year

[Verse 3]
Look at Papa Halterbush
92 today
Running off with Sadie Lee

[Chorus]
He's heading for that pile of hay
'Cause this is his once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Everyone's entitle to be wild
Be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when the tears have run out
We'll be numb and blue, blue

[Refrain: Mr. Hudson and Frank Ocean]
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I still dream, dream, dream
I still dream, dream (There will be)

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
My grandaddy was a player
Pretty boy in a pair of gators
See, I met him later on
Think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know
But pretty soon, he'd be gone too
Hide my face, hide my face
Can't let 'em see me crying
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying
My friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had
Well, I can
I'm sad and
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
There will be tears, I have no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
"I can't be there"
That's all you had to say to me was you couldn't be there
Why couldn't you say to me you won't be there?
You coulda warned me you wouldn't be here
Right here, you wouldn't be here for me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
You say you got a girl
Yeah, how you want me?
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless, of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, always in your lap
Like is you comin' home? Are you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 2]
I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal, just two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them
More of you on me, on us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you what you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for, 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday (Don't worry 'bout none)
Then just send him my way (Don't worry 'bout none)
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Outro]
Think I got it covered
Think I-

"'A storm is coming,' Frank says. 'A storm that will swallow the children. And I will deliver them from the kingdom of pain. I'll deliver the children back to their doorsteps. I'll send the monsters back to the underground. I'll send them back to a place where no one else can see them except for me'..."

[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when...

'Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho, since you think

Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though I'm lying down
[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1: Einstein]
To be honest, I don't really know how to start this
I never been big for showing emotions, but I'm broken hearted
Wow, that's crazy, it's hard to accept the fact
That after, everything we been through, its still too hard to forget the past
But, that's life, that's how the story unfolds
We doing our thang, two different ways, living life and growing old
We always said we were meant to be, and other people begged to differ
But none of that mattered to me, as long as you were still in the picture
So I, decided to frame it, but recently I been getting famous
I'm hitting the road, doing different shows, while you stuck at home, just waiting
Well, that ain't fair to you, but it ain't fair to me, what you decided to do
Going behind my back, but I ain't gonna go and put you blast, so I'mma leave it at that, cause I'm still too nice of a dude
That's cool, do you, I'mma do me
20 months, of love and trust, ha, could of fooled me
Jokes on me, we wasted time together
But you spend a lot of time getting wasted, so I guess wasted time was pleasure
Ha, it's whatever, might as well leave it at that
You changed so much there ain't no way we'll ever be able to turn back
But, it's hard to even think about being without you
Oh! Remember you wanted your song, here, I wrote this when I was thinking about you

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?

'Cause I been thinking 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinking 'bout forever

(Oooh, oooh)
[Einstein] You and me happily back together, together
[Hook Repeat]
[Einstein] Cause I've been thinking about forever
You and me happily back together, together forever
[Einstein] Cause I've been thinking about forever
You and me happily back together always and forever, and ever
Always and forever, and everOooh na na na, oooh na na na ooh, thinking bout forever

My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge]
Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Look up look up look up
You see the last line in the air
Reach out reach out
And try to catch one if you can
Right now they're flying
Circling in coasts in the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Feels like I'm on the 30th floor staring out my window
And seeing them right about to crash right into you
You marching on the sidewalk umbrella up
Oblivious no clouds shades on no sun
Right now they're flying
Circling in coasts in the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
(Look up look up)
You better look all around
(All around)
You better
(Look up look up)
I know they're coming down
(Coming down)
They're coming down
(Look up look up)
You better look up
(Look up look up)
Crashing

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Look up look up
And maybe you'll see the lies
You'll see him fly
Look up Look up
You'll see the lies
Look up look up
Flight 143 [?]
Flight 143 [?]

I've been thinking bout you
You know know know
I'v been thinking bout you
You know know know
I've been thinking bout you
Do you think about me still
Do ya , do ya

Verse:
I've been thinking
Bout the thing that we call the future
Can it come, any sooner
Stuck in my heart is the voice of a dreamer
Young hiroshima
Blow up the mind of the doubters
Spiritual doctor
He can heal your hate
We can never make a connection if we don't relate
By my faith, Got me
Feeling optimistic for the things that I see
See through Jesus so we can walk on Seas
I'm way above average, so what I see is not what you see
Its not C
I pray for the grace to be amazing
Sing along to my songs like hymns
Praises be to him
But my future is all I think about

I'm always thinking so far, ahead
I've been thinking bout forever
Thinking bout forever
I'm always thinking ahead (3x)
You know
Ive been thinking bout forever
You know

[Intro]
Get on my bike and I'mma fly through time
Until I'm with you
I promise

[Verse 1]
I'm scared
I guess I shouldn't be
But I'm a boy
In this adult body
I know I said
That we would grow old together
But I haven't
And thats cost you years

[Pre-Hook]
This is has been the one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears

[Hook]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go
[Verse 2]
I tried
With all my might, I peddled as fast as I could
Until the years just started to flicker past
Our life, oh all of it
I saw memories on both sides of the road
I pointed them out as I went along
Right there, we're making out listening to Purple Rain in the basement
And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it

[Pre-Hook]
This is has been the one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears

[Hook]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself

[Bridge]
I'm on my way there
To that time in space
I wish you could see, all that I see now
I'm headed towards you, yeah
I wish that time could wait
I'm on my way home
[Pre-Hook]
This is has been the one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears

[Hook]
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go
Lift off and go

[Intro]
Why do birds
Suddenly appear? (Mmm, yeah-yeah)
Everytime that you're near (Ooh-wee, baby)
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you

[Verse]
I'll be honest
You had me devastated
Shit you coulda
Held my hand through this baby
Just like mine
Versions of these
Belong to you
(Yeah-yeah, aye, aye)
After a while
They're keeping me
Close to you

[Bridge]
And that is why

[Verse 2]
Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, I
Never can say goodbye
Even though the pain and heartache seems to
Follow me wherever I go
Try to hide the feelings but they
Always seem to show
When you say you're leaving me
I can't help but say no
Tell me why, is it so?
I don't wanna let you go
Never can say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Oh, we're in this together
Have a little faith
Oh, you ought to know who you are
Oh, we're all children
We're all human, we're all breathing
We're all needing, more than what they're giving
Can't you feel it?
The space of what's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky
So you look down
Cause you've convinced yourself
That this is all you've got, all you've got

[Chorus]
But picture four billion hearts beating with yours, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it, together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together, we're together

[Verse 2]
I love you
And I don't know you
But I know the light in you
Is the same as in me
I trust you, like a brother
Cause who could understand the pain
Better than someone who's going through it
[Pre-Chorus]
You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky
But don't you look down
Don't you convince yourself
That this is all you've got, all you've got

[Chorus]
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it, together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together

[Bridge]
I've searched the souls of my people
For something to believe in
Oh, not words that I could say
But I heard them, I heard them

[Chorus]
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it, together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together

Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse: Lupe Fiasco and Frank Ocean Sample]
Elegant dust falls like water off tall cliffs
What starts as icebergs and small drips
Gangs up in what you can call crips
(Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?)
Blue seas, slipping like skis over the top like T's
Camouflage colored, chamomile on the battlefield
I relax and chill, yeah
Dapper Dan daffodils
Two G's worth of recording gear to make reports for your ears
I'm a little teapot, short and stout
But I'm a little ski shop, sports and routes
(Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?)
[?] double black diamond
Took that shop to a resort now I'm shining
Don't get a bullet lodged
I'm just here to lift 'em up, I didn't duck
Figure the flow icy so get a puck
[?] homie is sick as fuck
Look at it closely, but do it anti-socially
It's a winter wonderland but it's toasty
Two slots i work with both days
Two shots dapper pants
Niagara used to fall on my pair
Step outside, hear the voice of Creasy Bear
All up in the air like "Yeah"
Shit's the bomb, come talk to the derriere
Take every care, go blind stare in that glare
The air, Kool-Aid and Pierrier
Three cheers til they get him to cheer
I be blessed, sports and routes
I play with paths like Professor X
My on IG, that means you can snort the house
Tokyo freeze, look all this powder about, ha

[Verse 1]
You didn't come out tonight so a man could talk to you
Just wore that dress cause you knew that we'd all be watching you
You got enough cash to buy your favorite drink too
Out with the girls for the night and us guys, you give 'em the blues

[Hook]
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothin' for me
You can't do nothin' for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fuckin night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down

[Verse 2]
You see if I was another type I'da ran away from you
Off to the nearest one who woulda rolled because of who I am
So tell me your name or somethin', she said "Is it game or somethin'?"
"You pullin' the famous card, it's cute and all but not enough"

[Hook]
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothin' for me
You can't do nothin' for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fuckin night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
I see the end of the night

[Outro]
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down, oh

Go, go, go

[Verse 1]
Forbidden from the beginning
I saw her there (up there)
Been like that since I met her
They said I couldn't have her
Way out of my league
I never believed it
I gotta get her heart
I gotta make her mine

[Verse 2]
But what if she just tells me
I'm not quite her speed or
Shows me her bares hands
And crushes my ego
Dismiss me as a kid
Tell me I'm barely legal
But bareley legal

[Chorus]
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
I slept with someone I little younger, younger
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Who loves ya

Girl if I gotta show ID (show ID)
I'm gonna (gonna)
Won't let you get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Younger, no

[Verse 3]
This conversation is taking us for a loop
Taking you serious is difficult to do
Cause I don't believe ya
When you say that you don't
Ever look at me quite that way
You say that you trying to settle down
But you I'm handsome
I should be having fun
I shouldn't move fast

So I went faster
Cause it ain't no fun
Without ya

[Chorus]
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
I slept with someone I little younger, younger
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Who loves ya

Girl if I gotta show ID (show ID)
I'm gonna (gonna)
Won't let you get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Younger, no

[Verse 1]
Taking turns with pressing ignore
Only to come to the conclusion
That there's no one we both love more
Back and forth, emotional tug of war
Girl I love you
But I just can't do this revolving door any longer

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain't making sense no more

[Chorus]
Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I'm calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Maybe it's the "me" in you that I dislike the most
Ironically, in the beginning that's what made us close
And now that's the very reason
That we're slamming doors
But we're both adults, it's time we get over it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain't making sense no more

[Chorus]
So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I'm calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah
[Bridge]
If we stop this fighting
We can dance all night in this bitch
Be no fighting if you keep on rocking that shit
Won't be no fighting, I'ma throw the towel in
Cause I decided, I like us way better like this

[Chorus]
So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I'm calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I guess it felt a little bit better when we were still arguing about it
Cause in the words I could still hear love
Somebody still cared
And I would rather sleep on the sofa as long as you're still in our bed
At least I'm sure that you're at home and you ever left me yeah

[Hook]
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't

[Chorus]
Try to leave me
Try to stay
Giving up
Is harder baby
Don't try don't try
Don't try to leave girl
Try to stay
Try, try

[Verse 2]
It's breaking my heart to see you there
Sickening I hate standing at that station
It's a picture that I don't wanna frame
Tears in your eyes
Luggage at your side

[Hook x2]
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta work too hard
Tryna break my heart
But don't try, don't try, don't try
You ain't gotta work too hard
Trying to move on ohh oh
Try to stay
Try to think

[Chorus]
Don't try to leave me
Try to stay
Giving up
Is harder baby
Don't try don't try
Don't try to leave girl
Try to stay
Try
Try, try
Just try

[Verse 1]
Sad he never takes her no where
And she always in these rooms
She was more than just a phone call
She says she's really in the mood

Don't you move cause I'm coming
Girl tell him don't bother
Cause baby I'm rushin to you
Don't you move

[Hook]
Girl you know thats all you needed to say

[Hook]
Girl you know thats all you needed to say

U-N-I-T
U-N-I

[Verse 1]
My head fatiguing off the opus
Kept it underground to focus
I feel afterlife, six under oath, don't want no hocus pocus
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact, rip my facemask
Nothin' but, nothin' but net, is you Roger or Novak?
You still are no match, you get no rematch
Boy, you missed your moment
Persuing the MoMA, I'm all on my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold 'cause he's sculpture
Where's the shaman, Ayahuasca
I had WhatsApp'd him for atonement
I never ever trust the pre-rolled
I never let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him 'cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though
It forever seemed like time's up
When we swerved in the Honda
Now forever seems like no time
I mean, time flies when you have some
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons
My crew saved your crew
Like niggas came through with the Groupons
Cookin' with the grease now, truffle fries and Cholula
Are you slowin' down? Are you holdin' down?
Whoever held you down
Whoever propped you up, built the structures with you
Swished the buckets with ya, who was fuckin' with ya?
Really brothers when you needed that?
When you see 'em now is it forced black?
Hail Mary on fourth down
Hands to the sky, yeah

[Verse 2]
Peace to the holy, peace to the people that think they know me
Piece of Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing
Peace to the boys that we used to be though
Geto Boy North Face too cold on these hoes
Peace out to Willie D, Bushwick Billy and Face
Piece of steak grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace
Hands to the sky

[Verse 3]
U-N-I-T-Y, Neptunes and peace signs
Chiraq, Palestine like
Iberville 1995
You'd think that was airstrikes on outside
I put refugees in my villa, play kids the Fu-Gee-La
All this space Atlanta
Place order McMansion and two apple pies
I want the Porsche Bugatti-designed
Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up
How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine?
Sick, blue nose pit foamin' white like frappo jacko
El Chapo, de facto
Bell nacho, shell taco, crunch crackle
Green emerald, pink diamonds like Apple Jack bowl


Versace Versace I'll play the piano I'm not Liberace
You could stay seated I'm taking that Grammy your music is sloppy
Niggas is heated they keep on repeating the evening in slow-mo
I sold enough records I'm selling out cities, I don't do no promo
Marina Abramovic Riccardo Tisci Madonna Beyonce
And Donatella if you don't believe me believe what the blogs say

Like when you get all that you wanted and that shit is not what you hoped it was
You had you a formula, one hit the wall now you Ayrton Senna
You had you a lady, then she hurt your ego, now you can't forgive her
Yea

[Verse]
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
(Voodoo)
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
(Voodoo)
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
(Voodoo)

[Hook]
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands, in his hands

[Intro]
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a dream

[Verse 1]
From my Lou's I'm seeing colors
Turquoise, ocean green, hurricane silver, yeah
I'm falling, down a well
Wish you were the water there
Just like a sun without a flame
Fell asleep without a dream
I saw the light fade
I let it drift away
I'm in that air and it's hard to breathe
Gravity won't hold my feet
(How'd I let my love breathe?)

[Pre-Hook]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

[Hook]
Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Verse 2]
I'm in Emerald City, looking for Wizard Oz
Maybe he could tell me the way
To your heart again
I click my J's three times wishing she would've stayed
And then I thought I put her on a plane
Found a diamond for your ring
The crows on Saturn, then I'm back in L.A
I woke up, she ain't there
Levitating off the mattress
Baby where you at?
I said, oh, baby where you at?

[Pre-Hook]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

[Hook]
Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Outro]
It's just a dream, that's all our love is
It's just a dream
(It's just a dream)
(My love is in that bottle)
(Save, save me)

[Intro / Verse 1]
We missed the light show
(That's what I call the weather)
Missed it like a three, a three
You and me and
I'm so sorry
I meant to lift the blinds some
So the sun could show off on us
It kind of slips my mind
Whenever we're in bed

[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

Shades on, lights off
But you on
And I'm on you
Oh yea
[Verse 2]
See my reflection on your chanel
(vintage)
I just got those for you
(tight)
I put em on you
(haha)
If you want baby
I'd go and lift the blinds some
So the sun could have a look at ya
But I see you just fine
Whenever we're in bed

[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

[Bridge]
Now just right
Round my head too
Keep em on
When we going
Going strong
Got the red ones
With the polarized tint on em
Oh
[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

Shades on, lights off
But you on
And I'm on you
Oh yea

[Verse 1]
I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose, but baby, don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman, but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something

[Chorus]
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try
You and I try, try
We all try

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I still believe in man (Oh, oh)
A wise one asked me why (Oh, oh)
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked (Wicked)
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try (Try, try)
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try (Every girl tries)
You and I try (Every boy tries), try
We all try

[Outro]
Try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe, try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe, try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe
Oh, I, I do believe, I do believe

[Verse 1]
I don't believe in love, cause I don't feel no pain
Been with so many dudes, it just don't feel the same
I don't believe in you, your albums sells ain't true
I believe strippers should get health insurance too
I don't believe that you gone leave her for me
At that award show tweeting out yall selfie
I don't believe that you call yourself suing me
I've been through enough, why can't you let me be
I don't believe that God took my aunt from me
And I'm just crying because I don't believe in

[Hook]
Nothing, nothing
Pray to God that he'll show me
Something, something
Cause I feel nothing

[Verse 2]
I don't believe I'm single to this day
I don't believe in much, but I still pray
I don't believe the Grammy's didn't nominate me
I'm a lil' ratchet, but my music's everything
I don't believe my best friend stole from me
I don't believe my sister cares for me
Make me a mother, and I'll make me a wife
Never made me smile, but always made me cry
It don't work out, but I gotta try
And I'm just crying, cause I don't believe in
[Hook]
Nothing, nothing
Pray to God that he'll show me
Something, something
Cause I feel nothing

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt (Skrrt!)
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga

[Chorus: Frank Ocean and Tyler the Creator]
I ride to California (Yeah)
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me (ayy, yeah)
Slick circles float roll
Out this world
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Tyler, The  Creator]
Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton
Water your garden, my nigga (Stunt on these niggas!)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too (What the fuck?)
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man
It feels like I'm winning (I'm winnin', nigga)
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me
Slick circles roll float
Out this world
Yeah, yeah
Run it, run it, run it, yeah
(Ohh, ohh!)

[Bridge: Tyler, The  Creator]
I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I-
(Let's go!)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a lil' while, nigga makin' leaves
Keep it in my branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is skrong
Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez
Droppin' them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Ah, shit!

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh
Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it

[Verse 1]
I'm out in front of Supreme, like I own it
Buttercream Benz, goldfinger wheels
Driver can't steer, but look like Pam Grier
She like "Where's there parking around here"
That spots reserved, so are those right there
Reserved for who?
For pretty girls in sports cars

[Bridge]
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Cause my license been suspended
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Got my feet up on the wood grain, roof missing

[Hook]
You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be a gun but you're a girl
Only if whipping could kill

[Verse 2]
Up and down Mulholland, on the weekends we chill
You're driving with no shoes - cruise control
Love the way you take the wheel
Got your photo on my air freshener
In a sense just like the

[Verse 3]
I just finished practice
She's on her way to get me, she's in traffic
She said give her 20 minutes (I'm finna hop in the shower)
Girl I hope 20 don't mean an hour
And as the cold water runs over my chest
I've been thinking 'bout your skirt on my head rest

Pretty girl driving my sports car
Pretty, roof missing

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4]
I let you drive my Benz
Flossing all your friends around town
I let you fill my seats with shopping bags
I let you go do your thing riding with your friends round town
Riding with your girlfriends
And I always keep it clean
So why don't you park in the front just to stunt
That'll make all them bitches mad
Why don't you lift up the roof just to stunt
It'll make all them bitches mad
All them girls wanna be you
[Hook]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything is going to be alright?
One look out my window, there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and it was silent
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I'll forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love like you forget a daydream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
We'll all fade to grey soon, on the TV station

[Verse 1]
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
(Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed, we're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times

[Verse 2]
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

[Verse 3]
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life (life), in this life (life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
(Thought you might want to know now)
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life

[Verse 4]
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam



They treat you rough out there
But we've got Alcantara everywhere
Ferrari

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mine on the road
Your dilated eyes
Watch the clouds float
White Ferrari
Had a good time
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're so familiar
White Ferrari
Good times
I care for you still
And I will
Forever
That was my part of the deal
Honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari
Good times

(In this life)
You love me still and you will forever
You got that part of the deal
We got so familiar
Running my hands thru your hair
White Ferrari
Had a good time
(in this life)

One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids
On a facelift
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it it'll be over in no time
And that's life

I'll drop you off and in a few months
We'll talk again
When you need a break
Which part of the circle will you stand on
You keep doing the dance wrong

I'm sure we're taller in other dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of moving
Your body's aching
We should vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull
Least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam

Like a mirage
Always one step ahead
Where we belong
I've got a son somewhere
He'll be picking up where I left off
I might name that boy Ferrari
He'll meet a girl named Altashonda
He'll treat her soft like Alcantara
My brain is soft like Alcantara
My hands are rough, I'm iguana
Your hair is long, are you Nicaraguan?
I can't go soft, I'm Viagran
You want it all
You're always one step ahead
Where you belong

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]

Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything, is going to be alright?
When I look out my window there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and there was silence
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I forget

[Verse 2: Melo-X]

I forget 23, shit what year was that?
Nowadays life can fly by so fast like cars you see on highways
Watch 'em driving past, they all got a destination
Many elders say that you should focus more on the steps that's takin
To get there, but damn it's taking too long, been waiting so long
Now I feel like I'm breaking my strong
Ways of thinking about the reality of this industry
And exactly what it takes for me
To get to where I want to be
If trees could speak
They would talk about these brand new humans that came around
Building things that brought smog around
Now, how's that for gentrification?
While I'm patiently waiting the arrival
Of real shit that goes viral
I speak to those with they eyes closed
Tell 'em open 'em up
Sit, back, relax and tote on a blunt
Frontin' like I been sober for months
Last night I was in the club laying drunk
Screamin' out what the, huh
Yeah you know the word
And at the end of the day I'm just tryin' to be heard
Ya heard
[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]

But I forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a daydream
And what if all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
Will all fade to grey soon, on the TV station

[Verse]
Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry

Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter

[Outro]
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire

[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler, we, ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme, I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the skyline
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind, I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow!
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? Where we at? Where we at? Where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Bimmer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says "Fuck 'em!" on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter, that's where I'm at
Now, where we at? Where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at? (Wolf Gang)

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah, I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah, she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? Where we at? Where we-
We on top of the world, on top of the world
Nigga, top of the world

[Verse 4: Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane?
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at, nigga? Where we at, nigga?
Uh, we on top of the world, on top of the world

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Where we at, where we at, niggas? Where we at?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

[Verse 5: Tyler, The Creator]
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth, Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying "Fuck everybody", I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home, but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do, Clancy and David are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully, I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully, I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining, making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
"Can we get backstage, man?" - No, faggot, it's sold out!
"Come on, why you holding out? I thought we was boys
Without me, you wouldn't be Tyler, The Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots!"
But I'm a fucking unicorn! - Whatever, man
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full Monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
"Here's some 'Give a Fuck' cake" - Oh, maybe I should have some
"Asshole, have none!"
How can I wake up on the wrong side of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
("Shit, I don't know")
When I'm on that stage, I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me...
In school, I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah, I'm rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building!
[Outro: Tyler The Creator, Hodgy, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
[Gunshots]
Fuck, take this!
Nigga, what the f- (Hodgy)
Nigga, what the fuck are you doin'? You just gon-
Nig- hold on, hold on, nigga, can- (I'm sorry)
Ay, nigga, all the shit that we been through, can we just fuckin' talk about this? (I'm sorry)
Nigga, you just gon' shoot me in my moth-
[Gunshot]
I'm sorry, fuck... the fuck did I just do? Fuck! Ah shit!
Tyler... (Fuck, man) Tyler, give me the gun
(Ah fuck) Give me the gun. (The fuck, man? The fuck?)
It's gonna be alright (Ah fuck man, I'm fucked, I'm so fucked! Ah shit!)
It's fine, Tyler, believe me
I don't know why the f- I don't know what the fuck I was thinking, man, I don't f-
It's gonna be okay (Ohh fuck dude M- Ahh)
I gotta hide the fuckin- I can't hide the fuckin' bodies
I'm here to help. I'm your friend
(Now w-) You were supposed to fuckin' help me!
I'm here to help you, Tyler. (The fuck!)
Calm down, I'm here to help you. (Fuck! Agh!)
I'm your friend. *Crying*

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Over where the trees burn down
The place where the fields went down in flames
We could put a hole in the ground
Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
And tonight I'll hold you close, close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we dance this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring when flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (when I was young)
See me (too) wither
(when I was young)

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Know that (me) I've enjoyed the sunshine
When I was young, know it happens all- (me)
Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine- (me)
Know it happens all (me) -all the time (me)
Know it happens all (me) -all the time (me)
When I was young (me, me)

[Intro: Stacy]

Hey, uh, call me back
I don't mean...how I came after the other night
I just I had a lot to drink in
I wasn't thinking, I miss you, call me back!

[Verse 1: Stacy]

I've never known a love so strong
You've got my heart hemmed up in the palm of your hand
And therefore I surrender, never had to wonder boy
I'm wherever you are
You are , you are
And I can't sleep without you, tossing and turning
Turning and tossing, exhausted
Wondering where you could be
If not with me!

[Hook:]

You are as necessary as the air I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You're like a vital organ I can't live without you, without you, without you,I need you!
I need you!
Hmmmmmm

[Verse 2: Stacy]

I was born alone, but I don't wanna die alone
It be a lonely life to live
If it was just me and all of this, no one to share it with
I'd give anything for a family and an apple tree
Upon the car seat up in the rear
Baby on board, baby on board
As I look forward..
See all of these things coming into tuition
But you're young, so young

[Hook:]

You are as necessary as the air I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You're like a vital organ I can't live without you, without you, without you, I need you!
I need you!

You are as necessary as the air I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You're like a vital organ I can't live without you, without you, without you, I need you!
I need you!

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]

Damn, I can't believe it!
No, no, no can't no, can't believe it!
Baby I loved ya I did, ooh, I did ooh, I did
Keep a pair of your panties under my pillowcase
Ew, but baby that's real
What you didn't want me to lie?
What's gone, long gone
No, you didn't like this
You didn't like 'till I was gone, long gone
Now I moved on, and you in your fucking DeLorean

[Outro: Both]

You are as necessary as the air the I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You're like a vital organ I can't live without you, without you, without you, I need you!

Said I can't live without you
Live without you, live without you live without you
I can't, no!
I need you in my life!
You're like a vital organ I can't live without, without you, without you, I need you!
I need you!



Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
How you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild and I need you now

Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah, I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
I found you, oh Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
And I need you now

[Produced by Cashmere Cat and Sinjin Hawke]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
That you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
Love you (Got to)
Love you (Love you)
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost and found out
[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessy?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah, I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Verse 3: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
Well, I found me, oh, Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I need you now
Lost and found out
Yeah
[Verse 4: Kanye West]
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
Ay, I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said, "Baby, what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?"
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph, around hella thugs?"
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves
(What if Mary) "What if Mary
(Was in the club) Was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?"
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
(And she was) We surrounded by
(Surrounded by) The fuckin' wolves

[Part I]

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
The rings all ringed out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
We found out

[Part II]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye [Laughter]

[Bridge: Syleena Johnson, Kanye West and Rick James]
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all
Man, I promise

[Verse 2: Ant Clemons]
Feel like De Niro on Casino
Louis suit got me lookin' like Pacino
Got the Goose and it's chillin' on the ice
What you expect? Meet a girl, got her blowin' on the dice, ooh
She just told me, "Yandhi, you my hero"
I can tell that girl just wants the free clothes
For her cousins, aunties and her freak hoes
But her cousin's auntie is a freak-ho
[Outro: Ant Clemons and Jeezy]
Change in few can move a country
Inner peace don't cost no money
That's the stuff you learn, another lesson learned
(Ha-ha!)

[Intro]
Ohh yes, ohh slide...

[Verse]
Xenons with the blue color
If that's a lease, least it look cool on you
That's your business and I'm off, when I'm on you
Like holidays, I get off on you

[Verse 1]
She saying bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say
I'm like who knew, who knew, who knew
After all these years I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too?
When I met you, you were
Chris Brown, Beyonce and Kells too, Kells too
When you met me I was
T.I., BG, Juve, Outkast and UGK
But we're both long way from home
Got the windows down, radio on
I wrote a letter to the sky, saying maybe one day you can kiss me, kiss me
My girl found it in the car, saying baby why you tryna diss me? Diss me

[Chorus]
You knew you're my baby, you knew you're my baby, yeah
I'm not just in it for the ride, I'm not just in it for the ride
I'm not just in it for the ride, I'm not just in it for the ride
Cause you knew you're my baby

[Verse 1: MuffinCheese]
I'm ace of spades in the game
These bulls be foolin' to quit to get slain
Blow hella ghost, no blocked, cocaine
I was indicted no longer detained
Olympian movement, I'm flaming, I'm torchin'
'member stealing bags all on the porches, I'm talkin-
Bout' power moves over pineapple run
Ain't bout that college, my name came out my gums
Diagnose pussy like Dr. Doolittle
So thick when I smack that ass; ripple
Leave a body tweakin' on the bed; cripple
Teach her the tongue trick, gave em' a riddle
Mo'fucker talkin' two-piece of McChicken
Gone with tellin' times, never been driven
Try to play me; I don't think with dick
I just finessed -
Him and his bitch
Seen em' again
Said he had the stick
Fuck him and his clique, he ain't doin' shit
I got the recipes; Gordon Ramsay
Flippin' Prada, don't take off her panties
Get your precipitation lookin' fancy
Getchu a new one combining candy
OG said he had the kids he was cappin'
We drive by the crib, we seen em' exactly
Phrasin' the Octagon, I seen the depth
I evolve with the -ism with blood in my system
I'm thankin' God for my wisdom
Pockets colossal I'm Juggernaut
They can't tell if I'm on drugs or not
Judgin' be sweet like some apricots
Only actions I don't say a lot
Only goal is to get paid a lot
Only goal is to get paid a lot

[Verse 2: Diego The Sharqman]
Elevated, got a tunnel vision, no tough decision, I just execute
W-W-Walkin' in on some cool shit
Next moment yo' bitch not next to you
I'm thinkin' you already got the message
