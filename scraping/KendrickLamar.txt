[Intro: Big Sean]
Ugh (Cannon)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Couple niggas on a hit list and bitches on a different type
Same shit, different nights, 'til I live a different life
"Sean, you lookin' tired," damn, homie, that's all?
I've been stressing so hard I'm surprised I ain't going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into y'all, hating
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slipping like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleeping with that MAC and I ain't talking 'bout computer love
Owe the wrong people, you a price tag
Now you pray to God, hoping that you got a Christ tag (God)
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Take a elevator straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there, too, ugh
[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Post-Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Ooh-ooh, if I just stop breathing
Even though I got all this motherfucking money
Won't keep my heart beating
Just don't wake me up (Don't wake me up)
You can't catch me dreaming
About all of this motherfucking money
Cocaine rush, I'm speeding
Cocaine rush

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, I'm just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
I go extra harder the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection; at the same time, I'm acceptin' the fact
That there'll never be nothing perfect about me
Shit, I'm just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin
We are 6 Mile-bred, that's why you see our sick style, yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks, as y'all can imagine, is chatty, yapping at me
Five years ago, I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I'm Cali swagging
Huh, my nigga listen, I'm over the fame
You number one, I'm number 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin' with lames? We ain't rolling the same
I'm the best out in this motherfucker
If I could get a check out of this motherfucker
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this motherfucker with no regrets
If you ain't living your life for your kids, I ain't giving your ass no respect
(Sean, I love you, my nigga, I'm out)
[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I gotta break your fuckin' heart
I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb 'em)
I gotta do something that's innovative, creative
Just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia's momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty Carne Asada
I gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a—I got a fine, 'cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt
The youths need to know every detail about this Earth
The Devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important, the end is near
[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die[Intro: Detail]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You was a college student abusing the credit union
The music was way too loud, the tuition was fuckin stupid
And me I was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' Buick
Confusing, you like my style even though I was broke and doing
Stick em ups, you wanna pick em up
Inside your Civic Plus the difference was
I wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us
And I missed the crush that we had every time winter December come
And we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, and I'm shootin' himself
And the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself
And I'm losing now too looking at you boo hoo from what's dealt
So as I reminisce the coupon that we used to split at Rally's
On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
You say K. Dot your page got that pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day you'll reap what you sow, now I reap for us both
That's one hunnid
[Pre-Hook: Detail]
Now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka
And all I ever see is your face
And I be sitting here thinking bout the shit that you’ve been doing

Hunnid, hunnid[Intro]
Everybody get the fuck down now
Soul in the building
Yeah, we taking everything
Everything you got

[Verse 1]
Hit the deck I need everything you possess
I suggest you cooperate for this tech
Send you to the doctor to operate
You complicate my scheme to get rich
I'll put this heat to your T, let it steam a little bit
Look, when the chips get low, my fifth just blow
Anything that I could pawn, come about that, dog
It's money to be made and if you got it I'm taking it
Just run it like a Jamaican and shut the fuck up, nigga

[Hook]
And that might leave more than a rash
I'm coming for your ass
Please hand me the cash
Cause when I'm down on my last
I gotta re-up fast
Point me to your stash
Don't make me say it again
Before I lay you with Reagan, Benjamin Franklin, and them
Frankly I'm a menace
In fact I'm ready to blast
So whatever you got, run it
Like a 100 yard dash
[Verse 2]
Coming for you
Don't let me catch you slipping in that pretty whip you dip in
You would get pulled out
Like my dick in these women when I'm finna bust, don't test my clout
Your execution is a must, no doubt
For the longest niggas been taking my kindness for weakness
But this trigger is killing me and I'm just dying to squeeze it
Fire for hire, don't let your murder transpire
Thinking you will live forever like a fucking vampire
I arose from the dark to claim everything you own
And there's nothing between us but opportunity and this chrome
It don't take a genius to know I mean this, so ante up
Before I load the cannon up and blow your ass to Canada
Nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm wild with it, pistol whip whoever's in the house with it
Call the cops, tell 'em like a date, I'm going out with it
Give me the goods, give me the hand me downs
Tell your wife to pull her panties down
I need those too, what you gon' do?
Don't jeopardize your life, for the nigga hard body made of cement
Plus I'm loaded like this clip, off of the Seagrams
Lay you on the floor like granite
Granted your granny watching, I'm grinning like I ain't just hit 'em
Better believe it, my head's sort of off, shit
I would have robbed Jesus for the cross if I caught him slipping
God forgive him for this long arm like Pippen
The cars honk but times is hard hard and I gotta eat
Give me the watch, the Sean-John, even your sneaks
Give me your socks, your drawers, your fitted, your Boost minutes
Give me your stocks, your bonds, your blunts, your bongs
Your food in the fridge, your iPod, your celly
You say I'm wrong but I'm deadly
That's dead wrong so I'm heavy
Like Chris Wallace, regardless
You're getting stuck up, pussy
Like a tampon with a handgun, push me
But I ain't on the swings, I got this infrared beam and it wouldn't miss a thing
Bow!
[Outro]
Chyea! Rose
I got you nigga
I want everything
I want the jewels, the watches, the bling bling, all that shit
All y'all little niggas getting your chains robbed
I'm on you
I'm just playing y'all, I wouldn't hurt a fly
Came out dope though
Carson arsonist
Yeah, it's funny that you say Carson-Carson arsonist
That's where you're from right? Carson?
Yes, yes sir
Where is that exactly? If I looked on a map, where would I be lookin'?
Carson is right in between Compton and Long Beach
Shout out to Carson, Del Amo, that's where I'm from though, DA

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
Extra hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P. I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach, I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter; any fuckin' rapper, fuck it; Painter
Skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat; sleep; shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big K.R.I.T.]
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist



[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
They hollering at the K back
M.I crooked slay that, been killing beats since adapt
Yeah me and rhymes go way back, way back
Time machine flow when I was swanging and riding
If you ain’t repping for your people then you’re shucking and jiving
Tap dancing and sliding to beat that you can’t comprehend
How dare you speak on where I’m from if you ain't never been
Fried Kool-Aid who made, never ate that in fact
Grandma was chefing for real, made meals off love and scraps
Thank God for my country folk and family
Instead of a metaphor I’d rather take it by James Anderson
Damaging how they televised Basketball Wives
And not tornadoes in the South and how we lost lives
Still rebuilding, pray for the children that have no hero
Only the villains that tell them get money
Sleep when you die, I find it funny
Because when you rest in peace don’t mean fast asleep in slumber
Thank God and stay humble

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Real rock, rap and not to Xerox, weird not
Enough to make you fear a lot from here watch
I ran scrimmage and I fought to the damn finish
And I popped eyes open without eating me canned spinach
My fans in it constantly tellin' me I can win it
If I stand grimace damagin' man every damn minute
I blend then expands quick it slams wicked rhyme
Grand spittage, H.A.M. with it, fam dig it's N9ne
Chea, hard to see me like the background
Your rap styles comin' softer than a cat’s meow
Red laces big-booted like I’m Iraq bound
That frown will get you ate by my cannibal from Sac Town
So relax pal, pat down, gat down, bat down, blackout
With a fat smile I might react foul, so don’t make this cat growl
I caught everybody when I spazzed, wow—who do I catch now?

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
Cleveland, what up?
Yeah, Kells, uh, Cobain's back
I smell like teen spirit, man, Cobain's back
And I got these teens screaming like Cobain's back
You try me and I’ll make you a legend like Cobain’s strap—blaat
They say I’m wasting my time
Where the watch at? How he got that?
They say it wasn’t my time
Where the watch at? Now watch that
Speed of my syllables rhymes, better clock that
Stop that, Bad Boy gave me the contract and I dot that
Now who the heck is this, with his pants red as 666
All up in your girlfriend’s TwitPics?
That Eastside boy up out the 216
That’s making these other rappers get Melo like the Knicks, eh
Get you spitters huck-to finished
And when y'all win the game and the cypher was a scrimmage
So everybody gossiping tell a friend and a pigeon
How this white boy just bodied Black Entertainment Television
Lace Up!

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Pushing a hoopty, bumping the Fugees
My life is a scary movie, your life is a male groupie
Kendrick Lamar broke the handle with 22 Uzis
Stuffed it in my mouth and cack-cack-cack!
Killed the rappers that knew me
Compton’s most wanted, I live my life in a dungeon
Came out a dragon I can probably touch the sun with...
My bare hands, what are your plans? To win a Grammy?
Sweet taste of victory, like Oprah’s punany?
Don’t judge me that’s just some irony, trust me
I like to laugh and get lucky
My sense of humor is rumored to be a Gemini’s company
Come with me, in the planet rock
And I plan to rock in a plantation
Chasing many legends that made it
Face it you will never be Pac-10 even when the planet stop
I’m 2012 on a 12-inch, aiming straight at your pelvis
Elvis would come back as a Black if he was hot
You’re just a mascot on a Kim Kardashian ass-shot

[Verse 5: B.o.B]
Full-blooded pedigree, prize fighter special breed
My flow slow, they say it got special needs
I’m talking Ritalin, maybe even Adderall
Four bars from me would probably kill your whole catalog
Sixteen would make Deborah Lee cut the channel off
Thirty-two would make Paul Bunyan take the flannel off
Sixty-four would make your mama want sixty more
I eat haters, check the crumbs on my kitchen floor
They say my music’s pop
I call it buyin' cribs for my mama, shakin' hands with Obama
And if you don’t believe me go online and check the pic
And if you check my flip cam you’ll see your sister in a flick
I’m perfect from the field it’s like I can’t miss
I’m on a rant like Durant no pick no assist
Ya'll tripping on TIP, get off my man neck
I’m just saying Martha Stewart left prison in a jet



[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I'm heavy hearted, heavy handed, misunderstanded
Turn a permanent repercussion, I empty the cannon
I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in the wood
Drink a gallon of Henny, throw it up for the hood
I'mma ride for my people, give my people a voice
Never followed a leader, use my weapon of choice
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out
I own assault weapons that fold out like Megatron
The iron long, drop bottom bombs on Babylon
So tag along like a dog with a vagabond
Smoke 'till the cess is gone
Niggas on their grind, put my motherfucking records on
So they can relate to the hate and the pain
To the struggle and strain
Never take it in vain, breathing one and the same
Pressure push your forehead out the back of your brain
So west

[Verse 2: YG]
'Bout to bring the coast back, 'bout to bring the coast back
Told them make it nasty like some motherfucking cognac
Pull up on your niggas like Jordan at the three line
Still in the hood, hanging like beehives
Your money like knee-high, my money like ye-high
I whip the Porsche like it's a horse, maybe say yee-ha
We striped like Adidas, and be bang like speakers
'Bout to cop a couple of houses and have more spots than cheetas
You sell with the coke, I sell with the flow
You off-brand rappers wouldn't sell/sail with a boat
You be tweeting a lot, you be talking too much
But when daytime pass, you still wouldn't bust
We can pinky-promise, but I still wouldn't trust
They talk down on me, but I still look up
Just was talking to Nip, he say he still fucked up
It's the westside, niggas get chipped like woodchuck

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
What I represent, the whole coast line
All on my back, fool, I'mma hold mine
I do it everyday, I do this every time
I got my motherfucking nine every, every time
I told you why I came, see this is all about
The way we push the east coast all the way to the south
You see us in the north, hey man, we going off
Seventeen shots, hit 'em, look, throw the Molotov
Blowing up the building, I raise, everybody feel it
Everywhere a rage, you can feel me coming through
Everyday dropping down, throw everything I got
When I fly high as the sky
Walking on the clouds, say it loud
I'm so hood, nigga, too bad to be good
Looking at 'em like I wish they would
I burn 'em all every time, any place and they know they could
Step to the side any place, stepping up in Inglewood
I got the homies, on lock

[Verse 4: E-40]
They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter of fact, they never have, never will
They'll never be another E 4-0
I told you once before
I ain't rapping too fast, y'all just listening too slow
You may not see me on the TV channel
But in the hood I'm still hot like the left-sink handle
Mobster like Marlon Brando or should I say Tony Soprano?
I hit you with the heel of my .40 caliber handle
Platinum and gold plaques
I was doing the damn thing while y'all was drinking Similac
Macking on mine, that's what I told your batch
She think I'm a .jpeg, she wanna get attached
Turn up like the vegetable
Speaking of vegetables, right now I'm on this medical
I got this heinous style I'm feeling mane, I'm throwed
I'm a boss, put the president on hold

[Verse 5: DJ Quik]
I got big plans to make, big dough to get
I got big tracks to rhyme on, this supposed to hit
Got big bottles to buy, big bushes to saw
Now how the hell y'all hate me and I'm just like y'all?
I need a watch that's shiny
To make the spine be the same color as the piping on the seats behind me
Diamonds in the ring, and the watch is apparent
I ain't gotta prove I'm fly; parrot
I’m Phillip Drummond producing the Mrs. Garret
If the shoe fits, ten and a half, I can wear it
I spit it like I meant it, you resent it? Splendid
I spit the four bars before this verse had ended
Whatever the trend is, I pen, this is not freestyle
I’d like to see my pistol like Lennon did
A big kid, and an even bigger adult
I'm slow flowed, I should be pushing Renault
And I'm solo, yo

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
If I said I'd be doing this at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be just the innocent Kendrick you've seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in a seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer, a doctor
Instead of a boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
And do 'em all if they gossip
Children on the corn, stay vandalizing the option
Of living a lie, driving their bodies with toxics
Constantly drinking and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen coward the concept is aim it, then bang it, then slide
Out the bitch the deposit
The prize on his head that tithes probably'll go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the critics
And Snoop passed us the torch, I'mma burn you rappers with it
What's up?

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, it's back on me
I guess I'll take the microphone casually
And do my thug-izzle straight from the dome
And let you niggas know that's watching at home
BET, easily, let me show you how it go
S-N double O, break down a smooth flow
Breaking like dominoes
Lay it on the table for you
Let you a little game for your mind
Get a lawyer, this is too much for you
You couldn't understand
Let me drop another plan holding my left hand
Moving my right hand, dropping the next game
Quik doing his damn thing, I'm spitting mo' flame
Preme there on the turntables cutting up shit like
Snoopy D-O double G, making you get right
Never, ever hit like, we do this like
West coast motherfucker, bust in your face like
What?



[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Most of these niggas shouldn't be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Xanny imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Your wig'll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap pillers, gangbangers, and dealers
Streets keep watching, aye, click, boom
The ghetto bird get shot down, straight to the top now
They want a third strike on my background
But nah homie, put the mask on when I slide on 'em
Put the cash in the safe and here's a extra slug 'fore I shake
You smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet, a wet break on a plate
Burning your faith, all your senses covered in tape
Fuckin' with them boys in blue
Chill out before I send them rags at you
You running to the cops saying, "How we do?"
Saying it's just rap and them lines ain't true
So I just do Q, fuck it, a ménage à two, or maybe trois
Baby girl need a papa, I be her dada
Coochie smacking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, with Oxymoron, Rock

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I ain't no backpack rapper, I ain't no lyricist
And if we ain't talking to you, mind your business then
Cold with it, Black Hippy, yeah, we cold niggas
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us, they bones quiver
Heard some clown throwing stones at us
Holding boulders, champ
Once you hear that "YAWK," watching domes shatter
It's Top Dawg; we runnin' rap
Whack rappers, feline, reason why we don't run with cats
Nine double O five nine, where my family at
Pull up in that family van holding tools like the handyman
And to be real, not with all this rapping, politickin'
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
'Til I'm finished, 'til I make a couple tickets
Then I'm outtie on them islands with my crimmies chilling
Hide your feelings, now can I live?
Look, I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
'Cause everywhere I go they like
"When you dropping some work?"
Been a threat since birth
The rap game's pallbearer when I'm dropping the hearse
I ain't new to this, I'm true to this, industry's nightmare
Red strings in my Nike Airs, yeah, the white pair
I'm Jay Rock, America's most wanted
My charges? Killing MCs without warning
Rock!

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
It's Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, I'm the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing a sticky
All odds against me, still even the score
Probably why I'm always OT on tour
TDE, believe me, we want war
I don't even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, two triggers, what's the difference?
We all gon' die one day, until then I'm gettin' paid
My grandma watching so I ain't gon' curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse
Backwood full of OG Bobby Johnson
Medicine in my soda, tryna dodge the coffin
And these days are so bittersweet
I guess it's just a balance, we battle naturally
And y'all still trippin' off of JAY-Z Tweet
I still got laps to run when me and JAY-Z meet
Peep, Soul brother number two
The first one used to make beats for CL Smooth
Top got the S550 but the CL smooth
And rolling weed is the only time I see Ls move
Soul!

[Verse 4: Isaiah Rashad]
I think I found my second home, Sunny California
And it's your little nigga brother, you ain't meant for corners
It's what they told me
So I never looked back, I got a shell in the bag
Fat as elephant ass, so we flirt in the path
Passing propellers, I tell her, tell her we flying, just listen
See, we diamond, just shining, and they gon' find us glistening
Brought sand to the beach and we left with your bitch
For the record in Guinness, I'm a hecklin' menace
Where's Robin? I'm Given', fucking minding my business
He a regular victim of some regular women
Regular niggas, you always cater to sluts
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk
I put your motherfuckin' dreams in your face
You keep looking for some women to be all in your face
That deep dussy reach niggas, keep dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a nigga be dussy
You can never rap better than me
'Cause you ain't dedicated
You ain't underrated, you ain't underlooked
You ain't overbooked, you just undercooked
It's supposed to be me and my niggas in the record book
Now they got me out here by myself - still fresh as fuck

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
I hate y'all, I'd do anything to replace y'all
Shout out to Face Mob, a ghetto boy
'Til I'm unemployed with a day job and kicking boxes
I kick ass and then kick knowledge, I'm way more polished
Than ninety-nine-percent of the scholars you thought had graduated
I'm the master that masturbated on your favorite emcee
Until the industry had wanted me assassinated
You either corny or an opportunist
I let you eat, now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
What are we doin'? I'm 'bout to crack the Da Vinci Code
Yeah, and nothin' been the same since they dropped "Control"
And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you
High-five; I'm bulletproof
Your shots'll never penetrate
Pin a tail on a donkey, boy, you been a fake
I got my thumb on hip-hop, and my foot in the back of your ass
Aftermath get the last laugh
I serve niggas like Master Geoffrey, jump on the curb
Turn a shotty to a verb if you let me, you know I'm a killer
I'm on your head, they know I'm a killer, the West Coast Cosa Nostra
Under oath 'til it's over, you over-owe us
So what the fuck? I fuck you niggas up, I fuck you niggas up
She suck and fuck, I fuckin' duck you fuck niggas like when I want
You go at us, you going fuckin' nuts, acting irrational
Pop you then pop an Adderall, know the drill like a lateral, nigga
I'm more Pappy Mason than Pastor Mason
Pacing back and forth, racing, my thoughts, on them racing Daytons
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
I feel like some of y'all is hatin'
Quite frankly, your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick
Accidents never happen when murder's involved
Immaculate tactics, so follow me, if you need me, just call on me
I say, "Hold up, wait a minute
Your career ain't shit unless you got some Kendrick in it"
Your pussy ain't shit, ain't no room is left on my dick
'Less you look like Jordin Spark, make my mark on that clitoris, mwah
Hollywood's been good to me
Lil' hood nigga used to pawn mom's jewelry
Family jewels big as fuck and I got the balls to say it
Balls deep, ballin' out 'til Spalding need a replacement
I'm outchea, the West in your mouth, chea
Invest in the vests of Vietnam vets when you out near
The white court building, spilling its Merlot, fillin' women, a Virgo
Pimped the industry, 'member these Stacy Adams and fur-coats
Shook, you're scared to death, you're scared to look in the mirror
When Kendrick is near ya, King Kendrick!

# WITH KENDRICK LAMAR
^ SPECIAL GUEST TO BE ANNOUNCED
TICKETS WITH* ON SALE FRIDAY 9 13 13[Part I: XXX]

[Intro: Bēkon]
America, God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me underst—

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
Been a messed up day for me
Know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
I can bring him closer
Spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody killed my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a homie's spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch the homie leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Man, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you play with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, man, I promise
You chip the homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—
The screen reads: "This is a satire by Kendrick Lamar"

[Chorus: Bono & Kendrick Lamar]
It's not a place
(Uh-huh)
This country is to me a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
It's not a place
(Uh-huh)
This country is to me a thought that offers grace
For every welcome that is sought

[Part II: DNA]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Run your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice
On your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice
Run your life, I live a--
Run your life (ahh)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

Tell me somethin'
Uh, you can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA is an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floor
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the camera
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Won't you tell'em I got millions on the way
[Spoken: Dave Chappelle]
Hi, I'm Dave Chappelle. And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America. Sorry for the interruption, please continue...


[Part III: Freestyle]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah
Say got work for Kung Fu Kenny
Know you got work, got work for plenty
Him got, her got, more got, Benji
Damn
Top off, getting topped off in the city
Big Top Dawg and I dance on 'em like Diddy
Pop off and I pop back like Fifty
Yeah

[Part IV: New Freezer + Kings Dead]

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I gotta dance
I Milly Rock when I get that advance
How can I shop with like 64 M's?
Talkin' to Top about business again
He want some lot with new Bentleys again
I want some top from like two sets of twins
Twenty twin twins, yeah, yeah
[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria, but I don't see it
I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic, tapped in when I'm maxed in
Comp-Town with the MAC 10s and the pumps in the background
Absent, never OG, standout
Lackin' everything else but doubt
Magnum, holding Magnums with a Magnum
Homie, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Boo yaow, boo yaow"

[Spoken: Dave Chappelle]
Is this on cable? CBS? It looks like it's singing and dancing, but this brother's taking enormous chances. Rumble, young man, rumble!

[Part V: King's Dead]

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Never had friends, never had ends
Never had hope, they was like "nope"
I was like "boo yaow"
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day
Know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Burn integrity, burn your pedigree, burn your feelings
Burn your culture, burn your moral, burn your family
Burn your job, burn your land, burn your children, burn your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger

[Intro]
They felt like they were laying tracks, for the generation to come. I think my mother knew that freedom wouldn't come in her lifetime, just like I know it won't come in mine. It's a matter of, either we stay like this or somebody sacrifice, somebody laying tracks, so we can stay in a 360 degree. Deadly circle, somebody used to break out and risk, you know losing everything and being poor and getting deep down. Cause someone has to do something, had I had a father, had I had some of these opportunities. I would be able to handle my mother more

[Verse 1: Punch]
I was taught never trust a nigga, far as you can see him
Teach a nigga how to fish, as apposed to try'na feed him
Look a man in the eyes, that's the best way to read him
Cause faces they change, but point of views remain
I got a strange feeling, that I'm a lil bit different
Beyond the customs and tradition of a project living
My Korean war vet, grandfather's affliction
Was stress and I inherited his heart condition
And Van Arthur's addiction, was heroin needles
Petty hustling, d'evils, that street men lust
So I'm mixed with that lethal combination but trust
I've only scratched the surface, what's underneath this verse is
The feeling of a young boy lost, without a purpose
Still waters run deep in the street we were submerged in
Police lurking, try'na catch a nigga serving
He ain't going back to jail, so he bust a verse

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
This is for my everyday young nigga
It don't really matter where you from niggas
Before you leave the house, kiss your moms nigga
Cause you don't know when that day'll come nigga
Cause only Lord knows that I know how you feel
What we gotta do just to live
Is try not to get our cap peeled, try not to get your cap peeled

[Verse 2: Punch]
It's hard to get to know me, unless you hear between bars
Tortured soul self contained on my childhood scars
I was involved from a far, affected by the street laws
Concrete walls, not even earthquakes could shake them brick walls
Nickerson garden projects this is me y'all
Where Dope dealers have it all and then freefall
Caine numbs the pain up and down the ghetto seesaw
The voice of the youth, they hear me and they see y'all
They don't see a diamond in the rough, they see flaws
They should see how we was raised and they would be in awe
Against all it gets hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full-time job not to grab the semi-auti
And go kamikaze on somebody who plotting
Probably on my body laying lifeless, ungodly sacrifices
To the streets, this is the trinity
Money malice and murder the hood's deity

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They say the average black man only lives to 25
Well I made it past that and a nigga still alive
Which means I'm in the red, I'm indebted to death
That's the wages that sin pay, I'm still tracing my steps
Leaving my footprints in the sand, the concrete rose
That grew on infertile land and blossomed to a grown man
My only fear is pops holding moms hand
Dripping tears on my casket, I refuse to let it happen
By any means avoiding the city traffic
Shooters got the green light, they blocking your right of passage
A young kid turned savage, city madness
A picture painted on the street's canvas, excuse my brashness
I'm trying to live to see past this
Staring at the world and my rear view past tense
In no particular fashion, I'm on borrowed time I'mma grind with a passion

[Hook]

[Outro]
Generation to generation to come
They won't come in mind
Sacrifices, sacrifices, sacrifices
Deadly circle, deadly circle

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ooh, ya'll done stumbled on a fortune
The rebirth of hip hop since they got abortions
And I rock like Mt. Rushmore, grab your thesaurus
So you can find a synonym of a nigga that been gem
Diamond in the rough
Sheriffs wanna see me cuffed like the links of a button up
Book em down! Fuck is up?
Mind of a Vietnam Vet when a nigga rhyme
A nigga shine, like I'm seeing signs in a different light
I'm on my grind, see it right? Real starving artist
Finna blow like a Mario Game cartridge, standing on my own two
Me and Dave like Big and Puff before shiny suits
Welcome to the Compton Zoo, lying with a lion on Rosecrans Avenue
A tiger on Central
Arms so soar beating up these instrumentals Sounwave give me
More, after that find a morgue with a mortice, because we..
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ooh, and I'm back up on my bullshit, shooting to the top with a hollow
Tip full clip
Analogy is like a pit bull on the pulpit, I drool I don't really
Spit, mad dog in this bitch, foaming at the mouth, is you a man or a mouse?
Sipping Mickey's, while you looking like Mickey trapping it out
That's not a diss, that's really a dope line, and in order to see my vision you
Probably would go blind
I'm chilling with a blonde, she dumb as fuck, but she can suck a bowling ball
Through a straw, that make you tell your mom
I'm just a little nigga trying to make my city proud, I used to watch Doug and wear
My cousins hand-me-downs
Now I'm grown up, unemployed, sipping Henny, pissing throuh a cup, and still get
The job done, 2DopeBoyz I said what up, tell your listeners to have some frost
Bitten gloves cause
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, she got that shit that make you kill a nigga
Crack that last bottle, I'll kill it with you
Pour my feelings out and spill it with you
That's a no-no, but what he don't know
Never hurt him, so just desert him
I find it hard to believe that he ain't pullin' your weave
No, I'm kiddin', I'm knowin' my dick is different
He kept his distance, I kept comin' over and stayed persistent
You bitin' your lips, toes twitching and she crinching
Steamin' up the bathroom 'til we left it a sauna
I beat it up and now you usin' my tee as pajamas
Your friends tried to warn you about me, even your mama
But you said you'd deal with the consequence, even if it was karma
But how can I complain when you give me insane brain?
Like you graduated with honors, you probably hate that I'm honest
But, fuck it, I'm going all out
You should too, good things don't last forever, I thought you knew
[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Now don't you no worry about that
Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now here we go again, from the bed to the floor again
I hear your phone on vibrate and I know it's him
But that's what happens when that kitty's in the lion's den
You start lying and changing places
You might've been, I might've been too aggressive
But it was far from desperate
I mean, the swag I got, just know it's half the effort
They tryin' to toot my own horn
But, shit, I sworn that I swarmed up in it, stamped and fingerprint it
Left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger
Don't be passing up 'til we finish
What we started, you with it? I'm with it
Then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
While I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
Camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open
I'm hoping you come to grips
At least before you provoke 'em to trip
But that's inevitable, and if I put you on a pedestal
That means I'm fuckin' you on a chair
[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Now don't you no worry about that
Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Now that I got you about they thinking out you
I want to stop and I don't want you to stop that
Ow, we in a phase, oh, I can't wait
Cause waters don't label you, oh, no, no
I'm from, came from the bottom, so just get on top of that
How about with the top back with your top back?
Take that off, uh, ooh, ooh, break that off more, more

[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love

Once the neon light hit the Top Dawg logo
See my, chain hang out
See my, wrists hang out
See my, homies hang out
They, gang bang out
West coast my state, left coast my state, you state myspace, internet gangster
You know my name baby girl no stranger
Blue Bell jeans on low cut taper
No I can't save ya
Name that captain
[?] when I'm in the Aston, Martin
So awkward when I park it
Rev up your engines, sound like it farting
I'm in the club sitting with some foreign
She don't speak English words sound retarded
We go hard in that project apartment
Five minutes in Watts, get it started

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Sit back relax I'mma give you a walk through, through the city of Watts, through the city of God
Where them bitches shaking that ass, deuce deuce in they bras
Where them niggas rockin' the flash, drinkin' liquor that’s hard
Where they keep the Glock in their pants, chopper's right in the car
And if you step up on the daily's you might leave with a scar
If your gang tight might leave with a broad and like two of her friends might enjoy a ménage
And that's night life, in Watts California
Parties ain't over till like six in the morning
This Hennessey's straight, gotta nigga zoning out
Take another swig then I'm rolling out
If you ain't banging better hold your mouth
Don't claim nothing that you know you're not
So just chill, grab your bitch because life's too short
Just stick to the script

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Said I'm a fuckin' monster
A massive attack, I haunt ya'
I mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
Mastered that after that I went for thermometers
Popped 'em all, then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Holla back they promised us
No pajamas insomnia
Will attack, I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet (Blah!)
And you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendars calisthenics and silencers exercisin' that trigger strap
Rock with us, Metallica, competition no talented
I'm in a jungle what's wild enough
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin' my soldiers dyin' this is Iraq
Alliances lining with stars and bars of a prison rep
My science applyin' pressure, her stretcher is needed, pay the proceeds
Or your livin' debt y'all soft as a giga-pet
You niggas can't see me unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet, I spit 'til I feel my breath
Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest? She fuckin' the fuckin' best
Mean my dick is the dick of death, mean I'm killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, Dre
Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin'
Whether you storm to your climate
Whether your beat makin' or rhyming
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman
Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island with Ray Bans
Glasses palmin' asses that probably came wit a great tan (laughs)
I be the motherfuckin' mecca of these hub city spectrum
Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frog rectum
Why you wreckin' with irreputable my worst flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera etcetera Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you 'bout, about face with army outfits
The generals here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair and me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet
Put me in a category
I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory
Your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they Crippin
Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Bitch I been doin' before you niggas ruined it
Show me somethin' different
You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies I know your statistics
Who your boss, he more like my assistant
Get lost have a egg and a biscuit
Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missin'
Q...Q

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Double up, shit, what the fuck?

Target flowed I'm somewhere blowed
Marriotts and Swisher Sweets

X O henny scrape the keif
Bangin C I'm bangin' B
Put them niggas next to me
Stop and focus get the lead
I'm here now let the hardest speak
Ya all them dudes got ovaries, period
Run on sentence still I'm ventin'
Air conditionin' coolest breeze
Ill diseases
Grip my penis, shoot my semen
Still I'm comin', miles a runnin'

Head is throbbin', she's a goblin
We be mobbin' over bitches
Stick and miss and she the business
Get a witness pussy frenchin
Yes, a mission
Poppin' off like on a mission
Proposition, gettin' money
Drop a nigga, rush a nigga
Stomp a nigga, crush a nigga
Dust a nigga, copperhead gon' thrust a nigga
Heatin' up the winnnin nigga
Somethin' to remember nigga
Hella sick, I got a spit
Curse with a verse like God told me to kill the shit
Load the clip Heckler & Koch
The hoover king
Bada bing by the ding a ling
Natural hoover
Fing ring with a vision clearin' it with Visine
Asian from Beijing
Money make her cum, she C.R.E.A.M
Feed the weak that's Wing Stop
At the start with rain drops
Autobot
Space shuttle shittin on your car lots
Boy style
Could at least got a saturn, huh?
HiiiPoWer see our patent, huh?
Workin' on tracks like we never been free
22 squezze niggas shootin' off C’s
Please thought a nigga shot 16’s

[Intro: Meek Mill & DJ Drama]
See, I'm an A1 type of guy (Uh-oh!)
I crush A1 hoes (true)
Rock A1 clothes (true)
Drive A1 whips (true)
And still pour A1 sauce on my shit
I come from the bottom (Poppin the bottles!)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Crushing all these hoes, rocking all this ice
Selling all these O's, nigga, I done did that twice
So I'm just riding round in my Rolls, about to get on my bike
Just to touchdown in my hood and I put that on my life
I'm like yeah nigga, I'm there nigga, I ball hard all year, nigga
My diamonds all clear nigga, smack my chain you dead nigga
I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what you thought
But all my dogs they murk, and all my dogs go hard, fuck that
My new young chick look exactly like Rihanna
Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall, buy her all types of designers
YSL, fly Chanel, all that Dolce & Gabbana
I jump right back like 36, lean hard when I turn the whip
If I ain't have my rap deal, then I still be serving bricks
So I kill a pussy, I murder shit, homicide on shorty
My gold Role cost 60 racks, my rose gold cost 40
[Hook: Meek Mill]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got a A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate on nigga
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
'Cause I got A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I got A1 credit, A1 hoes
I drive A1 whips, and I rock A1 clothes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Pray to God, I wash my hand but I be damned
2012, 100 racks to Uncle Sam
A 24 year old millionaire
Don't read the contract 'less a mill in there
A1 credit, park my car bowlegged
I got a bus full of bitches, I call it Jay-rome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, your ho be cropping the image
I let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga, I'll finish
Then come right back, hope you insomniac
Sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I pop your top up
Then more ca-ca-ca-ca, til I know I gotcha
Ballin like I'm baldin', then I see Jordan in the mirror
Nigga, that's flawless VVS, and CC text me, "What you wearing?"
Puttin my all inside your bitch, I grip her hips, that's power steering
About to hydroplane when I board that plane
And land inside the building
[Hook: Meek Mill]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got a A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate on nigga
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
Cuz I got A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I got A1 credit (Credit), A1 hoes (Hoes)
I drive A1 whips, and I rock A1 clothes, I'm gone!

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul & Alori Joh]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
It's fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
Before they crop us out of the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
But I've seen cops circle the block
I puff squares, but I swear, one day, I'ma stop
My nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams?
(Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me)
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
Section 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell, hell (Oh)
Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you can see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
Ayo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here, like, back in 04'
Started HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator
In a system meant to disintegrate us (Ooh!)
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight) But our future is not
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine to five
Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive
HiiiPower
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope
Soul!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Alori Joh]
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
I'm ready to go, ready to go
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Ready to go, ready to go
Life is a traffic jam
Life...

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Ab-Soul]
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie, I do, Section.80
Your son will play me if the radio won't
Daughters that just turn 1 'til 21 listen to Kendrick
For instance:
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story!
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now, my child, come on
See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent 23 years on this earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being over dope-ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar!
Now fuck 'em up, Terrace!
(Soul!)

[Instrumental Solo: Terrace Martin]

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
Know they can't control us
Know they can't control you
Know they can't control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight
You will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor, and respect
This is you
This is me
And we are HiiiPower

I'm trying to get cash, quick fast
In the back she's a [?]
With past of Trinidad
[?] plenty hash up in the stash
When you got gangsta black [?] up in the back room
When I walk back, more vicious than wildcats
I would have swallowed that
Nickerson Garden projects gain the profit
Of my lyrical content
Build a monument
Gotta put a clip to your conscience
Watch this, pull up on your block in a stick-shift
Pop six, watch you fall just from the fifth hit
The spliff lit, when I'm high can't I spit sick
First round, number one draft on [?] shit
Got the mind of a chief, the heart of a soldier
With a rifle got a hell of a range like rover
And the fight, got a hell of a strike like vipers
When the gat, got a hell of a aim like snipers

[Chorus: Jay Rock and (Kendrick Lamar)]
You wanna act tough
Let's see if you really are, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga let's go

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Since VapoRubs mom's got my Nyquizzle
I was just a scrub now it's all about the bizzles
Trying to make a buck slinging weed and E pizzles
My nigga hit me up, and as far the stizzle
I'll eat your ass up show you how a bullet fizzle
Get your ass touched one hand on your whizzle
The other on the clutch,  my middle finger up
Shit I'm not giving a fuck
Catch me on Rosecrans and Central leanin' like I'm supposed to
My brain is mental a nigga stay focused
Plus I'm in the hood with the hood rats and roaches
Caught crack, and served a three-fifth on my culture
Desert Eagle on me these niggas acting like vultures
I ain't dying homie I swear that your thoughts is bogus
Keep the iron on me I'll crease you flat if you approach us
Acting how you act you gone get some out of that holster

[Chorus: Jay Rock and (Kendrick Lamar)]
You wanna act tough

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I'm a Watts living soldier nigga
I ain't running, I'ma stand my ground
I'ma keep on gunning
My momma never raised a punk, nigga I ain't a chump
You disrespect you'll be on my thump
Ghetto kill, make you lift up
You don't wanna get struck
Like a match, got a back
That'll break a shit bruh
I attack with a Mac, that'll tear your shit up
Now the paramedics gotta come and make that pick up
Dog, I hit your block in a pick-up
Jay Rock I'm me, a lion, a man, a [?]
I do it by myself, with a hook and an uppercut
Doctor got a stitch you up
Nigga are you real or what
I'm a little guy but I'm tough
I hit hard then I'm natural
You a dead man when my gat bust
If you running nigga better run a little faster
These bullets like Heinz oh yeah they'll catch ya

[Chorus: Jay Rock and (Kendrick Lamar)]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh-uh, fuck that (fuck that)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section.80
And you feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party, trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Woah, woah-woah
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Woah, woah-woah, woah, woah-woah
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And then she started…
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon?" "Oh, I rap, baby."
"How old are you?", She say 22, I say 23
"Okay, then we are crack babies."
"Damn, why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax."
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, "Read between the lines."
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown her body and I know
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me, then looked at it
And then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood."
"You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D crazy."
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Woah, woah-woah
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Woah, woah-woah, woah, woah-woah
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Produced by Sounwave][Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Pardon my Bohemian ways
I know I act like I be stuck in a Bohemian daze
You said you love me, so don't rush me
Love is patient and now you gotta trust me
To take form, like the canvas of the Grand Canyon
Product of a beautiful storm or an unborn
Carried just below the heart
Quietly preparing for his start
Let me Michelangelo my Sistine Chapel
You know they say Rome wasn't built in a day
And diamonds need a while before they hit the display
So I guess I see myself in a similar way
I'm paced, like my momma in the kitchen whipping
Always mixing up and fixing
Begged her for a taste and she said it wasn't ready
She stir it up slow and she cook it up steady
This is not a race track, living in the ASAP
I'm just trying to do it justice when it play back
Sometimes I gotta stall the BPM
So I can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
In the end, I got love for the show biz
But sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
Keeping up with the Kardashians and Joneses
Nah, I take my time and compose this
[Hook]
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It's a secret garden in my mind
Flower child

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Okay, buffering, creativity suffering
When you bustlin' hustlin' for the numbers and
You missed the journey if you climbed too fast
The beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
Amateurs swear they need a balancer
I want that legendary like excalibur
Chasing calibers liberated as a bachelor
Traveler, never falling victim to these calendars
Rough draft after rough draft
No staff, perfecting on my abstract craft
And now they calling me celebrity
Only thing I give a damn about is my integrity
They play the game like checkers when I'm talking bout chess
Tryna do more when I'm talking bout less, I stress
Quantity ain't always quality
So let me formulate my prophecy

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When the lights get low and you notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow but only little you know
I will still breathe, give me the keys
I'm resuscitating the game, see me in CPR
My name is a gun cocked, gun shot
Dead and I won't stop
Gun cocked, gun shot
Head in a pine box
With a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot
Flowers on your momma's yard
[Hook]

[Outro: Nitty Scott]
They say greatness gets better with time
So why expedite my prime?
See I'm just a lilac tied to the earth
Exuding the fragrance of light and birth
So respect my photosynthesis
My petals, my stems, full of nourishing flow
You thought this was a love song, but no
I just need you to let me grow[Intro: George Clinton]
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?

[Verse 1: George Clinton]
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I was hard when I started
I'll be hard when I get through
For example if I had to sample some funk like you
Would I be funky too?
And another thing
It ain't so hard, it ain't so strange
If I could be funky like you

[Hook: George Clinton]
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I say, I was hard when I started
Going hard when I get through
Wait a minute, stop, act up, give them the dumb face
I don't think you heard me
It ain't too hard to get, it ain't hard to get with
If you got heart to do
What it takes to make you funky too
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
(Yo, George!
They say they want some more!)
Two tears in a bucket I'll cry with ya, huh
But I can never lie with ya
I can never afford not to afford
I can never put my plans to the side with ya
I can never see a red light like a deer with a head light
I freeze up when I re-up
See I really have patience
If you relatin', only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it
The reason why I hate to wait for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intention
They say time heals all
But if I could short cut my success motherfunk all y'all
(Straight up)

[Verse 3: Ice Cube and George Clinton]
By the way  I treat her
You know if I need her
See, Dr. Funkenstein
That's my spiritual leader
Some suckers don't like it
Cause I'm a psychic
And if you tricks don't like it
Hoe, you can dyke it
It's that self-made Kool-Aid
Look what red and blue made
Turned O'Shea into N.W.A
Triple OG, ain't never sold the key
Ain't never did time, they still respect mine
Ask all the nigga's, on the main line
Who they favorite, and what he's made with
Playboy, I ain't nothing to play with
I'm dangerous when it come to using this language
Me and star child, we talk to strangers
All the real hoods are ready to bang this
You might not understand if you came from Cambridge
I'm flashing blood, that's hard as stainless
Yeah yeah
It's good to be hard
It's good to be hard, homie
But damn
It's hard to be good
It's hard to be good

[Chorus]
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

[Verse 1]
She got me going, I'm all in
Fifty stories, I'm falling
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar but still, I feel ya
Energy sending me towards the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If you was, I would climb every other stair
I gotta stare, I mean wow
And I'm wowed, no one compares
A one-on-one, you must have won
Every pageant in America when you was young

[Pre-Chorus]
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...
[Chorus]
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)

[Verse 2]
So now we on, so now we going
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off, I stunt with her
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
'Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
You gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above
You definitely know, probably I gotta give it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)

[Outro]
You something different, I'm glad I found you
So pretty, I'll never do anything to hurt you

Gimme that '94 Puff shit, Ali
I'm so appalled, Louis Vuitton draws
The shit, a booth for me is a bathroom stall
If you're not fond of me, you're comedy, Little Duval
I have a lot of flaws, I'm human before all
I wake up in the morning smell some coffee, then tell your bitch to get off me
Mos Def, word to every autopsy
Man that boy bad, man that boy spaz
'Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave
He changed his name, he a conscious rapper
Naw mutha'fucka I'm just Compton's rapper
I might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get
But really I'm just as rude as Marshall Mathers
Is that a contradiction? He contradicting himself again?
Of course that's a contradiction, the fuck you think life is?
We not like like Christ is
We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say I like this
People don't understand why I went southpaw
I looked in the mirror and said I can't be like y'all
I can't be like Game, I can't be like Eazy
To get in this rap game, I know it won't be easy
Cause my shit different
I know
He from Compton, where he from, have he killed before?
Truth is, I ain't the most ruthless, but I'm not cupid
Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs
To get out Chicago
To move right back to another ghetto, on Sante Fe playing the lotto
I used to want a champagne two door Tahoe
Until I seen that same truck shot by five-o
Dead with his eyes closed, y'all should've seen him
Off a gallon of cough syrup, but rifles had leaned him
That's why these tough rappers man I don't believe 'em
Y'all wanna be 'em, I wanna grab bats and beat 'em
So they can feel the pain of the blocks I'm from
Where my heart turned numb
And the powder and the shells come up off that gun
Come up off your chain, or come up off your life and have a fatherless son
It's the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind
'quivalent crimes for jail sentencin'
No one preventin' this war
You sure, you sure
Sure as the edges on every ocean, now let's explore
The Kendrick Lamar LP I been promotin' for 'bout a month
Don't worry its comin' soon, like a fast nut
I never be gassed up, some labels they passed up
Now the industry crashin', I guess they got bad luck
Your bad, you don't write neither? There goes another fad
Shit I write ether
I get it in like the Vanna on Wheel of Fortune forcin' your forfeit
With the strength of the prime forces of four fork lifts
This is very extra necessary
This extra scary, this is Amityville
This the Exorcist on ecstasy pills
And if I can't do it my integrity will
Head dog wishes, every Compton bitch is
I mean this shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
They all got a fat ass but lower case titties
Now I gotta mix and match, jungle fever, white and black
Double D, Brittney, Becky get your mouth intact
Reg call 'em Jabberjaw, she gon' hop skip and jog
Just to read my twitter blog
Man these hoes pitiful
And to you bloggers that say I'm weak
You know how long I took to chop this fuckin' beat?
Y'all don't 'preciate shit
All y'all do is hate shit
And if I don't say shit y'all still say I ain't shit
And that's ridiculous
I mean that shit is
Fucking ridiculous

[Refrain: Allan Kingdom]
I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed
I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
All day hoe, my neck look sweeter than parfait hoe
Rap Derek Jeter in a red two-seater
I can throw this dick from far away hoe (swish it, swish it)
Ask me how long do it take to be the greatest
I'm a bar away hoe (swish it, swish it)
Damn Kanye never will it be safe
Bitch I already know (swish it, swish it)
24/7 365 days everybody gettin' paid
Nigga lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJ's
Chitown, PJ all of BJ
Chitown, we play for the freebase
These days, don't believe what police say
DJ's and the B-boys run shit
Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch

[Interlude: Theophilus London & sample]
Nothing bout you
Nothing bout you

So won't you dance, ayy, ayy ayy ayy

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Little darling, let me run (let me run)
Until I find myself
In the morning sun
Give me freedom (give me freedom)
Give me space
I want to find myself
In that special place
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa



[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 2: SZA]
It's getting cold when an ego gets to talkin'
I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no, I'm switched in the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, you didn't wait from me
Leave me alone, keep away from me
And it sounds wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just think for the life, for the days
For the hours and another like breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]

[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin' like ya involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no ways out, got to stay down
It's the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feeling like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cry for no reason, I ain't just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we're runnin' out of time
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
Love, let's talk about love

She stands alone
All in a crowd
Is it her fault that (not sure about this line)
She waits to see
What's happening?
Is it safe and sound?

She says, free me from this enemy
She's waiting to be set free
Free me from this enemy
She's crying to be set free

She takes so long
But it feels so right
To be all alone
She takes so long
But it feels so right
To be all alone

She stands alone
All in a crowd
Is it her fault that (not sure about this line)

She waits to see
What's happening?
Is it safe and sound?

She says, free me from this enemy
She's crying to be set free
Free me from this enemy
She's crying to be set free

She takes so long but it feels so right to be, all alone
She takes so long but it feels so right to be, all alone
She takes so long but it feels so right to be, all alone

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Alls my life, I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life, I...
Hard times like, "Yah!"
Bad trips like, "Yah!"
Nazareth
I'm fucked up, homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

Huh? We gon' be alright

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"

Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Get back
Look I started from the bottom, at the very bottom
Mixin' Hen with similac my momma knew I had a problem
I was jibbing for a bottom, putting quarter pieces in the black caprice and make it holla (Alright)
No releasing me, I got the piece in me, I gotta
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner-city bullet fly 'til that thing on auto pilot (Alright)
I don't really care about the care abouts
All I care about is wearing out your upper body
When I catch ya, when I catch ya, walking out your parents house
(Alright)
Fourteen years old sound so raw making plays home boy
Big K's and my big dogs
Never, ever, went straight home, boy
(Alright)

[Poem]
Ahhh! Ahhh!
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
Lucifer was all around
So I kept running
Until I found my safe haven
I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got
Making myself realize what my foundation was
(In the room, and I run it)
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
But while my loved ones were fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination

[Interlude]
Ay on my momma, nigga (R.I.P. Pat Dawg)
I'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma, doe like...
On the dead homies
Aye Sounwave turn this shit up nigga
Turn this shit up! Soundwave, turn this shit up nigga
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free
To Pimp a Butterfly, another classic CD
Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
Nigga, now R.I.P
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
[Intro]
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "God!"
Bad trips like, "Yea!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us
Then we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers


I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
Lucifer was all around me, so I kept running
Till I found my safe haven
I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got
Making myself realize what my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination[Intro]

Ay, on my momma nigga, I'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma though, like, on the dead homies
Ay, Sounwave, turn this shit up, nigga, turn this shit up
Sounwave, turn this shit up, nigga
Tell me who the bitch nigga hatin' on me
Jumpin' on my dick, but this dick ain't free
To Pimp a Butterfly another classic CD
A ghetto lullaby for every one-day emcee
Nigga, now RIP you
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers

[Intro]
God bless America
The home of the brave
Now if we could stay alive
Maybe one day Kendrick
We could stay?

[Chorus]
America
God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me understand?

[Verse 1]
I've, I've been here and there and everywhere
Just to find you here
And I see the future
And fear is a leader who leads all the world to its end

[Chorus]
America
God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me understand?

[Verse 2]
You, you've been waiting there and everywhere
Just to hear me say
You know the answers to the questions you're too afraid to ask
And time has no mercy
And now is the time to attack before there's nothing left
[Chorus]
America
God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
America
God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me understand?

[Intro: Jeezy]
(Cryin', cryin', cryin')
Yeah, what’s up? (Yeah! What’s up?)
Welcome to America baby (uh)
Home of the brave, American Dream, you know? (yeah)
Uh, yeah, yeah
Let’s go

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (what's up?)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it (I knew it nigga!)
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it (what's up?)
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
You either good or you great, you either real or you fake
That's why I stay spittin' the real because the real ones relate
Y'all must was raised by some haters, you niggas go ahead and hate
F-F-Four car garage for the 'Rari, that bitch came with the estate
I swear them streets get so tricky, glad I ain't fall for the bait
So focused and I'm determined, can see that shit in my face
You niggas go 'head and face it, lil' bitch, ain't shit 'bout me basic
Hit a lick on them bitches and went and iced out a bracelet
Never let my flaws and my past come get the best of me
Turn a two fifty to a half, I got the recipe
First, my president was black, now my president is wack
I ain't never going broke, what's American in that?

[Chorus: Jeezy & J. Cole]
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler (yeah)
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (ha ha!)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it (alright)
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it (alright)
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Got money to make, blow out the candles then cut up the cake
Then I put it on plate, I'm running the game, you running in place
Still a youngin' at heart, but mentally, bitch I'm a hunnid'-and-eight
Like Pun in the late 90s, my niggas is juggling weight
Running from state to state, gun in the waist for safety
I'm on a paper chase, whatever it takes to make me
A millionaire, silly 'cause how many really get there?
I mean, how many niggas is Jeezy?
Y'all make this shit sound so easy
Breezy, turn on the TV, see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile, back home, my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be thee
Niggas is there on the screen
'Cause that's the American Dream
Now here go the thing, listen
Hysterical screams, coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching 'em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number, they no longer care about the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods, I don't got time to explain
Out of fear that I won't reach 'em and since preaching ain't my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (ha ha!)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
(Yeah yuh)
These streets made for ballin' (yeah yuh)
Ten toes ain't for fallin' (yeah yuh)
I hear the world callin'
Tell me if ya all in (tell me if ya all in)
Look, look, I gotta eat, I gotta, make money with
I gotta feast, I gotta re-ly on what is known to the travelin' man
Set his own, got my Bible and my rifle in my hand, oh yeah
I gotta eat, I gotta, make money with
I gotta feast, I gotta re-ly on what is known to the travelin' man
Set his own, got my Bible and my rifle in my hand, oh yeah



[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
41 shots
And we'll take that ride
Across the bloody river
To the other side
41 shots
Cut through the night
You're kneeling over his body in the vestibule
Praying for his life

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Is it a gun? Is it a knife?
Is it a wallet? This is your life
It ain't no secret
It ain't no secret
No secret, my friend, you can get killed just for living in
Your American skin

[Ad-Libs: Mary J. Blige & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah
Oh-oh

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If I die right before I wake
Cross my heart, then I seal my fate
Life in the dark of the heartless
Looking at the remedy for all this
Everyday they look at you a target
Falling victim, them and
Him and her then this one, insensitivity
Talk bad religion, skin identity
Lack rash decision made by yours
Pack facility with the urban boy
Gun admitted he bear arm
The entity, arm and leg and head made to destroy
80% of the victim was yours
Maybe I get to relive years of war
Look on the corner, we been here before
Look at the momma, you seen tears before?
Pain bright and early
Rain, sleet, hail, snow, worry
More storm barricade the city
Prosecution, unhung jury
These days murder keep 'em busy
Sweet blood flowed on the gurney
Yellow tape tied around the street
Colin Kaepernick was more than worthy
I could reverse the day, reverse the time
Reverse the block, reverse the gun, reverse the shot
Reverse the law, reverse the flaw
That made us all the versions of a danger flock
Reverse the love, reverse the hate
Reverse the hope, reverse the way we playing sin
Reverse the moment, so we can live again
Life and times of the American skin

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
41 shots
41 shots
41 shots
41 shots
American skin

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
41 shots
Lena gets her son ready for school
She says, "Now, on these streets, Charles
You got to understand the rules (41 shots)
If an officer stops you (41 shots)
Always be polite (41 shots)
And never ever run away
Promise momma you'll keep your hands in sight"

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige (Kendrick Lamar)]
Is it a gun? (What is it?) Is it a knife? (What is it?)
Is it a wallet? (What is it?) This is your life
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
Sure ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
No secret, my friend, you can get killed just for living in
You can get killed just for living in
You can get killed just for living in
Your American skin

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Mary J. Blige]
41 shots
You can get killed just for living in
41 shots
Your American skin
41 shots
Be careful out there, oh baby
41 shots
Listen to momma [?]
41 shots
Don't wanna take the ride
41 shots
Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna take the ride
41 shots
Don't wanna take the ride
41 shots

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars
For the truth can be awkward

[Verse 1: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

[Bridge 1: Bono]
Look around, look around
Look around, it's a sound
Look around, look around
It's a sound

[Verse 2: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a thought
That offers grace
For every welcome that is sought

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
[Verse 3: Bono]
It's not a place
This is a dream the whole world owns
The pilgrim's face
It had your heart to call her home

[Refrain]
Hold on Brother John
Too many mothers weepin'
Dream on Brother John
But in your dreams you can't be sleepin'

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
American
American

[Bridge 2: Bono]
Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky
Could be too late, but we still gotta try
There's a moment in our life where a soul can die
And the person in a country when you believe the lie
The lie (the lie, the lie)
There's a promise in the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action, not to fantasy
The end of a dream, the start of what's real
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be our sanctuary
Refu-Jesus
[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
American soul
American soul

[Intro]
(Top Dawg, Money GANG)
Owwww, Dave, I see you, now see me

[Verse 1]
Look, I say I'm a millionaire
I'm a Top Dawg millia- no let me just come in unorthodox
I order plenty ammunition for the enemies that I got
I'm the King, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott
Bet I pop, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers
Guess I'm poison to rappers, front on me, get bent backwards
Stomping on em' like a Kappa
Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters
So where do I go now
Swear there is no-nothing after
I'm the bishop, I'm the pastor, I'm the god MC
And you don't want to get caught in the rapture
I would probably burn your whole colony
Chew you up then spit you out
You nothing but a Polla Seed
Follow hood policies
Compton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be
You never seen a killer til' you seen one on side of me
That green on the side of me
Fuckin' all about my fuckin' money like a sodomy
Fuck them bitches properly
I do it
I do it, done it, run it like I grown legs by the hundreds
My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry
Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs
Bummy, NEVER
Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather
And get ready for the detonation
I bomb on whoever
Whatever you bout, I'm bout it twice like a woman who give twins life
I steered right through your fan base every time
Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines
Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways
I'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave
Sasquatch is back, but what y'all really didn’t know is sasquatch can rap

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm iller

[Verse 2]
Ok, I squeeze the juice out a rapper and just squash this track
The people like "What the fuck happened and where Wayne be at?"
There's some boy named K Dot and he's a maniac!
I think his vocals is strapped, with a toolie, in fact
He spit like a Uzi, rat-tat-tat
He just shot me in my back, somebody pick up my back
I think that boy from Iraq, I think y'all boys better know that
He got it on lock like a Low Jack
Heading straight for the top like a ball cap
Y'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back where y'all came from
Ain't one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top
Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food
Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me
Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea
Recognize who I be, K. Dot motherfucker
Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock
On sight motherfucker, sight motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker
When I go pop, pop
Open up, close shop like a retail spot
Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie
Bitch that's no lie, let the truth be told
K Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stoves, burn up

[Outro]
Rappers: I'm iller
Dig it, like it, love it a lot



[Excerpt from "Mortal Man"]

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga

[Hook]
Now you got a body
But what I love most is how you put
Put your lips on top of me
You gots to be the baddest bitch I've ever seen in my life
Wait!
Your girl look better than you
You know what that means, I'm done with you
Bye!

[Verse 1]
Imma go hard, so fucking hard till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking arm
Whip the wood grain, whip the wood grain till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking palm
Break the blood vessel out their motherfucking eye everytime I ride by and they're looking at the charm
I laugh at em like that, with my seat laid all the, all the way to the back
And the heat lay right, right, right under that
Clap, clap, brr, brr, that's the sound of my gat
That's the sound of a 100 round drum, like a marching band, I'm a stand up guy
I'mma pump my fist, I'mma wave my hand until I get the attention of the president, pussy
Presedential suite, laying in, laying in nothing but money
With a dove skin bitch laying on the side of me
Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle
100 carat, nigga I'm the golden child
Full metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow
Blow your brains out, let it hang out, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip trial
Wow, I'm amazed by how you niggas talk about you're married to the game, ain't took a vow
I'll fuck em up, cut em up, shoot em in the foot, or just gun butt em up
Now, I'm on some other shit, we ain't on the same page
You ain't sticking to the script
Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex
Shoot up your whip, fuck your tire, leave your car flat
Blood or crip, I don't give a fuck bout none of that
All of y'all can get it, homeboy, it's more than rap
Training Day, I teach you niggas how to rap
I rap like I got angels on my back
God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Spirit
I don't write it
Off the top like a psychic
I kick, lyrics like Jet Li
Which produce money to put your boy on the beach
Shit, sand in my feet
Tell me what the fuck you know bout me

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Oh, no, babe
Yeah-yeah
Baby, you
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
*Woman moaning*
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Yeah
*Woman moaning*

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
If you leave this time, I fear that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
It seems that you're the only reason for it
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God, he must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked (And I poked)
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more (Some more)
And in my notepad, man, I wrote (Man, I wrote)
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip, then a toe tag is one last, I'ma hope (I'ma hope)
So iceberg don't float (Don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite, still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day, it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face and it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish, just stay planted 'cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh
*Woman moaning*
Ooh

[Intro]
The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

[Verse 1]
Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, ya know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Verse 2]
I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like "hol' up"
"Where you from?" I don't bang
"Where you stay?" Westside, that's a Piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said, "fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you"
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (I told you, nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Verse 3]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know?

[Chorus]
This is why they fuck with me (haha)
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

[Outro]
So there you have it
But I'mma leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone

[Directed by SZA & APLUSFILMZ]

[Refrain]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 1: SZA]
I can't recall the last time I took, advice from anyone
Shaped like a figure eight, who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyway? Not me
Are you hating yourself? Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

[Chorus: SZA]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired (of) always making amends? Oh
I know you hate me now (Here)
I bet you hate me now (Here)
Bring on the thorny crown (Here)
Crucify me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Cross my heart then I hope to die
With a peace of mind (A peace of mind)
Piece together my brain
Soon as this beat rewind (Beat rewind)
Nitrogen and propane
I spike your drink at times (Turn up, turn up)
I make it hard to swallow this game
You throw up every line (Every line)
I notice people got Napoleon complexes
That's my confession (Yeah, that)
You said that we're equal but I know you're beyond guessing
That I'm beyond desperate (Yeah, that)
6AM on a Friday morning, my darkest hours
Them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin
I'm dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers
Down & Out on my luck
Salt water all on my tux and I call, she don't pick up
Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean, there's no pretending
I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended, that's life
That's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold, and my new blood type?
Even colder, cold shoulder
Born Sinner, you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose
My dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini gon' show them faces
And this here just one of my moods, Babylon
[Chorus: SZA]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

[Refrain: SZA]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 3: SZA]
I'm really over the cryin' thing, wipin' my tears
Who cries anyway? Spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Who's God anyway? You're mine any day
It's burning, take me
I wanna feel your power, this final hour, tell me
Are you losing yourself? Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?

[Chorus: SZA]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (Here)
I bet you hate me now (Here)
Bring on the thorny crown (Here)
Crucify me
[Refrain: SZA]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru[Produced by Fallen Angel and Jesus]

Now I need a Detox, yeah, yeah, yeah
We can't do the same things that we used to
Nah, nah, oh nah

I remember growin' up, lil' Dogg Pound pup
Bumpin' "G Thang", mixin' gin and juice in my cup
And all I knew was N.W.A
Eazy, Yella and Ren, Ice Cube and Dre
Big Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg and Rage
Kurupt and Daz, RBX, the original gang
Tray Deee, D.O.C., I can go on for days
D.P.G.C., this the way I was raised, ayy
When mothafuckin' 2Pac was the shit
Specially when he was rockin' on the Doc's shit
Killa Cali where it all started
A legacy, me, I'm just happy to be a part of it
This West shit is history in the makin'
This here is the next step, California's best kept

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember when it all started
On Alondra, in that small apartment
Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges
Poppa flickin' blunt ashes all on his garments
Momma off a wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four but it's like I heard it before
House party crackin' off of the music Doctor record
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mockin' that shit like a parrot
My cousins kickin' up dust, Crippin', their flag, wear it
'Round their hand like a mitten, aim and use it for leverage
Shittin' on Compton sheriffs like "Fuck the Police"
Woofers and gold Rollies, every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped, dropped a dub
Just to hear Doc drop a jewel for the sake of hip-hop
Whoever thought the moment I seen you on bullets for "Cali Love"
15 years later you'd be savin' my life, what?

[Chorus: Tame Impala]
Only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
And we'll be screamin' out no rules, no rules
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you
My vision of the unsocial, it's so cool
Look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the game
How I see it this is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to
I refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya
Out your power position, my army head-on collision
Can't harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
Every time that I zone in, nothing is more convincin'
Than tellin' you that I won't bend, break or fake partition
I can't, this is my life design, this is me taking mine's
This is what I live for, this is me takin' yours
This is more than C4, this is what happens when
We ready to build and destroy, I hope that you enjoy

[Chorus: Tame Impala]
It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld, undertakers won't catch me
System ain't no system for justice if you would ask me
I'll tell you everything is corrupted, don't you walk past me
With the condescended look I can tell you're pretendin'
Like you my friends and you just a henchman, I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it, I'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
Trespass on your property I am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy
This is me changing faces 'cause I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The victory of fight is all in my eyes
The night is young and I can see your demise, I'm waitin' for it
You can’t ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell that you feel defeated
The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce?

[Chorus: Tame Impala]
It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
It feels

You know it used to be mad love (Uh)
So take a look what you've done (Uh)
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (Uh), hey! (Hey!)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at (Uh)
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that? (Remember that?)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more, ah!

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

And I don't think we can solve 'em (Uh)
You made a really deep cut (Uh)
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey! (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off? (Uh-huh)
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times

You say sorry just for show

You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go

If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Uh, uh)
If you love like that, blood runs cold

Right
Child of the ghetto, nobody explained to me
I learned from the streets no picture was painted for me
This niggas is frauds not what they claiming to be
Got my 9 11 niggas with me, they craving for beef
Let the chopper sing to them like Frankie Sinatra
High-school nigga, probably got shoved in a locker
This for my niggas up top getting ready for lock up
These rap niggas weak, x em out like a pop up
Known for making movies, give them an Oscar
Fucking Lo junkie, part reason why they stock up
Whole hood through the show, spending cake to watch us
Come home to you Kush God on the knockers
Ah, you fucking right
Just another day another hard laying night
These fucking weirdos, these niggas ain't bright
Playing around with DZA ball game, riiiiight

[Chorus: Smoke DZA]
I'm on my way, real on cake
Won't stop grinding till my crew all straight
I do my dude don't make me loose my cool
Knock them out the park
What you wanna do niggas, it's ball game
That's a ball game chump, ah
Ball game, nigga, the ball game's done, right
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
In every inning sure your career's ending
You niggas ain't winning, really you're short winded
The bases is loaded you ever notice
Your spot in your game was took, as I look at your team choking
Sore losers never can play us, a chin bruiser
Send shooters on your block scurting off on a scooter
I'm raising my stock with every hit record, look at my record
Your status will drop soon as they message me in the session
Minor league coaches we feed them bitches to vultures
You posing as a poser, we post your death on a poster
Your highlight is getting closer, to stardom we never start em
We starve em and tire mark em, in the dust so you can watch em
In God trust, I'm probably tied up with a cheerleader
Just your luck you fucked around and let a queer lead ya
Time's up, you play softer than Damien
We aim it at your cranium and leave fragments over the stadium

[Chorus: Smoke DZA]
I'm on my way, real on cake
Won't stop grinding till my crew all straight
I do my dude don't make me loose my cool

Okay, headed to that swap meat
Coppin all that Avalon
Fresh white T's and some J's what I had in mind
I remember days when a nigga didn't have a dime
Now I got big dollas, I just buy whatever come to mind
Choppas squeezed, I remember when I used to window shop
Now I hit the mall, buy it all 'cus I'm on the top
Boss like I used to dream of this moment
Used to roll that stress, now I roll that kill, I call it coma
Step inside my ride, I know you smell the aroma
6-50 top back, chillin on my corner
Used to be MacDonald's, now we eat at Benihana's
5 star suites with freaks, that's on my mama
They tell me money evil but it wash away my problems
Don't matter what the price, lil mama just know I got it
Aw, it ain't trickin if you got it
My bank account solid and my wallet need a diet

Like my nigga meet me outside
These homies rush me just so they can steal my flashdrive
My music that important, imported in iPod
Buying my CDs like payin ties, act God
I'm sure success will taste better than nectarines
Growing in the spring, basket's the fruit of life
Had the boy arrange me every time I pick up the mike
I hop my entertainment be a bigger impact than Mike
Can I live like the princess of Munda?
Got a princess to groom the lacks o my scalp with a golden comb
And I'm on, Cloud 9, stopping acts like in the sky
I'm from Compton, can't you hear me coming like I'm from the shy
I'm inspired from a magic twice, which art is a rep and run?
But if they knew my intentions the reff and probably run
I'm just a good kid from the city who made straight A's
Tryna make the transition from Rose to Kool Aid

Okay, started as a youngin, now I'm at the top
Used to ride the city bus, now I'm at the car lot
And we live up in the mall now, something like a regular
I ball every day like clap, I got my cheddar up
I used to smoke dirt weed, now I'm smoking better
But in school I couldn't get a girl but now I'm getting groupie love
Now I'm seeing better days, mama's so proud of me
Do it for my grandma but I know she lookin down on me
Reach in my pocket and grab big bills
If this is Caribbean rich I like how this feel
Hah, and ain't nobody help me get here
If you lookin for me at the top is where I'll be, I'll be there go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hello, hit every lying clip with a Eggo
I pop more than I pop for when the cop blow
You Fruity Pebble, homosexual wearing velcro
Who gassed you up? Man, I raised the price of the petro
Killing Cali, gang bangers and GTA's
Weed and water, come and swim on a tidal wave
I'm fucked up, psychologically braindead
I once walked into a Blood group, wearing all red
Wonder why nobody's banging on me
Getting mad as fuck, then the police came
Mistaking me for a real thug, this is not a game
I'm from Compton too, shoutout to Game, give me a pair of shoes
Finna skydive off the peak of my career
Though it's not here yet, you motherfuckers still know who's best
From the murder cap, you never heard of that, okay
What about now? Clip-clip, pow, man down

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a

Never know so ride around strapped and I
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang

Who said Long Beach don't keep it hood?
Five minutes away, say you can die today if you dumbing out
Well let's just say, if you run your trout
You fucking fish get shot in the mouth
And plus your bitch get shot in the mouth
That's ejaculation, you kiss it, then you taste it
I road around with my antennas up like
Television way before the satellite
K Dot mechanisms, learn something
I could tell that you don't know nothing
By the way you carry yourself
You dumb fuck, I'm basked up and Jim Carrey myself
You better duck, bless screwed, you'll be eating through a tube
I've been fueled, that's the fucking guy
I've been fueled, that's too fucking fly
So where's my parachute, I'm 'bout to jump from the Hoover Dam
No car cue, I think I landed in the Hoover, damn
They 'bout to shoot

It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a
Killer Cali niggas don't know how to act and I
Never know so ride around strapped and I
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang
[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I'm an East side savage, black matters bring tragics
Spray maggots, swat flies for the practice
It's a habit, laughing at you bitch ass niggas, get on my level
Heavy metal when I'm rocking in my jeans
Got a problem then I'm hopping at your team
Drop your captor for acting like he wanted the drama
Grab the llama, she baddest mama
House disrespectful, blame it on the hood I come from
Niggas cicadas, with their little babies walking with guns
Catch me walking with some
I'm double hot, I'm walking with heat that's under the sun
You blood pop, you done if you ain't got one
Better step your game up before it's over
Before you know it, you're close to showing
Sulken red, fall on the ground, you know he dead
Down for the count like an accountant
California, what you know about it?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Like Master Pete, I am the streets
Jay Rock

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a
Killer Cali niggas don't know how to act and I
Never know so ride around strapped and I
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
One time
Reporting live
Compton, California

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
And life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing
I was so sincere like Nas first name, in Belly
They tell me, it's very difficult to see 25
And if I survive it's probably with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Alori Joh]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are (fine)
We are, we are (true)
Through the, through barbed (wires)
We will, will break (through)
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Tryna get away from the world's stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately
In need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
She gon have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
She'll never get by, no how, no way
Welfare recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
And this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamis, waiting on the first
Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Alori Joh]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say she can't live comfortable
She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are (fine)
We are, we are (true)
Through the, through barbed (wires)
We will, will break (through)
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like, you finally got life
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Living off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian
In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like we just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God, cause golly
You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
And you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions, got a independent business-mind
And both of y’all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out

[Chorus 3: Kendrick Lamar, Ash Riser & Alori Joh]
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say they can't live comfortable
They gone tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad
Know it's a barbed wire that's always in your path
Through the barbed wire (just laugh)
Then everybody say...
'Cause I won't get caught again
And I'm here to stop the trends
You can catch me if you try
Disappear into the night
And I'm gone
[Outro: Alori Joh & Kendrick Lamar]
So you made it past all the barbed wires?
There's one more left *Gunshot*[Freestyle]
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics, so fine linens
Spending, established; with women dining and laughing
But, this environment got us violent, ready to crash in...to society
Take this driver seat, hope you fast' it
Your seat belts twice
When I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times like a bill could see "No's" from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax!
That's what my mental say, but my physical's been detached
I'm on some other shit like fuck the government
The mind [?], where's the mother ship?
I made a covenant that I was changing, but my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was plankin'
In a cold world, where ole' girl and her homebody gotta motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensations' insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga, which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick, life's a bitch when you ain't focus (Nigga, nigga, nigga)[Intro]
Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today…
I feel like
I feel like
I feel like

[Verse 1]
Bumping some shawty
Rollin my window down and hitting the highway
No its not Friday
But its my day
And sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up
Thinking that my music don’t stick like some nunchucks
Top dawg and we all stars like we run chucks
But never mind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game til' I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit haters die young
You can run to the poor pit
Pullin' off the pit stop
Car like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
I don’t even trip doe I don’t need no company
Me, I’m thinkin long term tryna' build a company
Kendrick the good kid
[Hook]
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today

[Verse 2]
Nigga, what I depose be so potent
That if the earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on a jet-ski and start West-Coastin'
I’m not boastin' or braggin' not a person I’m a dragon
Takin' action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came tell him that I be alright
I’m so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key
Old lady done called the police
Its just an average Joe walkin' with his heart on his Pendex
Don’t be afraid to speak
So to speak you niggas not within arm reach
Y’all midget Max swingin' on Shaq now have a seat
You can never coexist with my momma’s oldest
Kendrick be thy name
I got my mind right
My nigga locked in the pin, that's what my mind write
Ink over my brain
What's up
[Hook]
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today

[Verse 3]
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin' up your favorites is our curse
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissin'
Fuck you because you don’t see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too
Because she’s cute and the ass
Looks like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
Fuck niggas that can’t fight so pull triggas'
Fuck the new world gas price that cost a livin'
Fuck your love fuck your hate fuck your snitchin'
Whether you fuck with me or not
I don’t give a fuck you can keep your props
Fuck keepin' it real
I'm a keep it K-dot
Kendrick everyday Jay-Z didn’t lie
Fucker
[Hook]
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today

One time for Top Dawg Entertainment!
(Olympicks!)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Talk about it, make 'em talk about it
Life to me is currency, prosperity, I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like it's livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet
Lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga, play yo' part or parallel park yo' ego
Next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it
Or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a MAC
In the back of a 'Lac with a latch on the back
Of the trunk, hit a punk in the back with the pump
In the back 'til he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future
When you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block
With a cop, wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block, he watch with a block
Or whatever and cut, no cut, mo' guns, mo' guts, fuck boy
You fucked up twice, you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish, backflip head first smilin'
Cr-cry in the face of Jesus, we just pray we keep on stylin'
On you bitches, TDE, YMCM, big business, bitch!
[Interlude: Ace Hood]
Ace Hood
Birdman, what they do, big dawg?
Mack Maine, what's crackin fool?
Big money!

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Okay nigga, riding in a May-B, and I'm probably with Baby
Don't talk nigga, fuck you, pay me, intercept your bitch like Bailey
Okay, big money on this side
100 grand for the whip my bitch drive
Need a new safe, money getting too high
Dead presidents all in my Levis
Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish
Might cop me an Aston, Martin on 'em
Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up, she deep in a coma
I'm super paid, two shows a day
My Rollie gold, no time to waste
What it do, Bird? My fuckin' brother
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma
Hot as the summer, cold as the winter
Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber
Young nigga, got a lot of flows
Any nigga don't believe me, I make it look easy, easy, outta control
[Interlude: Birdman]
Just like that boy
Death forbids honor, ya understand me?
Dedication, respect
Fully loaded, yeah

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger
Uptown gangsta, get it how we get it
Third Ward soldier, suicide rider
Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter
Hand Persian rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fishscales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail
Fr-fresher than I been before
Higher than we even been, shining on them 24’s
Junior doing time ho
On the grind ho, while he doing time ho

[Interlude: Mack Maine]
Ya know, that time is money
And money still was made baby
Eight months ain't stop nothing, nigga
It’s like, jail was third base
And my lil' nigga still came home, ya understand? Yeah
[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
I’m from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That’s why when the babies grow up, damn, they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I’m so happy my lil' brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and Fail Boy
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain’t no pain I can't withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand (Young Money!)
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I’m in a whole 'nother tax bracket
Amen

[Outro (Billionaire Minds): DJ Khaled]
Shout out to the YMCMB bosses
Birdman, Slim, Lil Wayne, Mack Maine
One time for that boy Cortez, aka Tez!
This is how we do it
We ain't never gon' stop either
(Olympicks!)I'm more focused, see I'm nothing like you new [?]
[???] the front lines
Thinking they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all try robbing me
I shoot and have you laying between the sheets with the Isley's
We push the coupe like a high speed and the helicopters come and realize theres nothing behind us, it's behind me
Your honor, I fuck over these beats with no condom
This ain't really a rap, it's a porno, rewind it back
It's back to defining a loss, correct, they don't obey
Y'all ain't nice nigga, y'all just okay
Y'all  more than a Lil Jon phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, a modern day Issac Hayes
Fingers on the shaft, new to the theme song of your career
Study my craft, you ignorant?, I can do it without a pen and a pad
It's inspiration, something y'all have never had
If my pockets is something  you're trying to grab, see I pull out a rocket and peel you back like scab, you old news
Old dudes get out my way let the young boy come through, don't mention my age, SHIT
I'm on a mission for pay and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you're here
But actually you ain't accurate fucking with this music biz
The industry like "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here jump in the water
Do we really fuck with president Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
Five or ten labels like "What he hitting for"?, seven zeros or more
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me I couldn't open the door
I'm so far ahead of my time I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
I'm hardly impressed with y'all, I hate rappers
Where the true artists at?, if it ain't a good picture you draw don't bring it to the architect
Often y'all arguing 'bout who got next
Claiming y'all running the game niggas is barely walking yet
Hopping all over beats without going through training camp
Try studying a few greats and then maybe you'll be where I'm at
Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtape is mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not
Switching your flow, your flow in the same place
Don't just rap elaborate, expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, I ain't saying that you whack, psych
Like an invoice I'm just stating the facts, right?
The metaphors I write
In fact you've been a factor you've feared your whole life, no TV show
Don't compare me with them, that's like Jaws vs. Nemo
A gorilla to a chimp, Jordan vs. Kukoc
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino[Intro]
Before I commit suicide, lives will be taken
Mmm, real hip-hop, west coast

[Verse 1: Kendrick]
Yo, yo
Before I commit suicide
I see to it that a million MCs die, lyrical homicide
Walk up on 'em, circle the block
Hit 'em again less than 5 minutes exact, then fleeing the spot
This is Armageddon, two weapons, two palms
Guns drawn, bang! Motherfucker, bang!
One man Vietnam
.45 popper, rhyme like the 9-5 big poppa
On a seven deck yacht, eat lobster with my comrades
Head doctor, knee pads
Gave it to her out of courtesy
Curtains close on that Maybach
Lay back as I hop on my underground shit
Like a subway, derail the track, the real is black
True rhyme sayers, hitmen, crime payers, llama throwers
Hustle in front of corner stores
Street catered, for been living on minimum wages
It's not a threat, I'm doing myself a favor
With suicide
[Hook]
Before I commit suicide
Before I commit suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
I got my mind on the murder and the murder on my mind

[Verse 2: Kendrick]
You a liar, you and I are not alike
I flow like water, purify mics
Ask Sean Carter, Nasir Jones
Or anyone sitting on the throne
Don't get your career postponed
Women, children, I rode past in traffic
Can't steer, cars crash
I got a death wish, you might be on my guest list
I wrap rappers on stretchers
Guns clap in the direction your sepsis
No matter your gender, not sexist
You MC? You better surrender
I love breakfast, lunch and dinner
Killing these rappers
Sparring in the winter, training in the summer
More practice, let's continue
Doing numbers like an accountant
You wonder like knife, how much money I'm counting
You're damn right, I spit it pretty precise
And whenever the verse is done, means I took me another life
[Hook]
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

[Bridge]
(Oh, you motherfuckers think I'm playing, huh? Let me hop on my Daddy Kane shit, jump on my shit, 'Naw mean?)

[Verse 3: Kendrick]
I delete MCs under concrete
Verbal mass destruction, you want it? Then call me
A killer, I put these rappers on their death bed
One shot to the heart, one more to the head
My rhymes so clever I never fall off
From an industry nigga, they all get hauled off
But not from a sawed-off, but more like an uzi
Spit rap, and these succulent MCs get chewed, B
Money, power, respect, pussy and pistols
Hoes pop pills like it's a modern day ritual
But I don't sweat 'em y'all, I just behead 'em y'all
And leave the party jumping like players of B-ball
The B-board, those will die who decoy
Destroy any rapper thinking he make noise
It's K-Dot, the terminator
Fake rapper rhyme slayer
Those who live now will die later
[Outro]
The suicide

[Corey Holcomb]
Yeah, yeah. So, y'all all curious. That's fine. That's fine, man. I'm – look, I'm a tell ya how ya boy, Moochie, landed his ass in this goddamn slammer. It was Kendrick. Yeah, Kendrick Lamar.

[Prisoner]
Yeah, right. This motherfucker.

[Corey Holcomb]
That's right. Shit was wild, goddamnit.

[Prisoner]
This motherfucker.

[Corey Holcomb]
We had a ball. Ay, nigga, you ain't gotta believe me, nigga. Goddamnit.

[Prisoner]
He's just talkin' about it.

[Corey Holcomb]
Man, you ain't been in here that long. Your perm still new. So, anyways. You know what I'm sayin'? We had some strippers. They let us do everything we wanted to do, touch anything we wanted to touch. I was puttin' my finger in places, but my nail 'bout to fall off.

["These Walls"]

[Driver]
Kill these motherfuckers. You hear me?

[Back seat passenger]
I hear you.

[Driver]
Get that money and come out.

[Back seat passenger]
Man, you should a heard what this li'l' nigga was talkin', man. Talkin' so much shit on the block. Man, I been tryin' to tell ya. He talkin' 'bout he gon' get more money than me, he gon' get more money than you. I said, "Fuck this motherfucker, man. This li'l' motherfucker 'bout to get hit right now. Fuck him. Fuck this motherfucker right now."

[Kendrick Lamar]
Man, Malcolm, shut the fuck up. We gon' go in here, get the money, get out. Simple as that.

[Back seat passenger]
But you ain't hear what he said.

[Terry Crews]
Nigga, I'm a smoke yo' ass. Now you fi'n' a get smoked, talkin' shit. What, bitch? What? What? Let's go. Let's go. Come on. You're talkin' that shit. Where is this motherfucker? Nigga, fuck outta here.

[Dancer]
What the fuck, man?

["Hit the Quan"]

[Terry Crews]
People can get murdered. Yeah. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. What? What? What? What? Pull him up. Uh. We 'bout to murder this shit.  Murder this. Murder that. Yeah. Murder that and this. Ha, we killin' this bitch. We killin' this bitch. We killin' it. Get the fuck up. Get your standin' on, niggas. It's a stand-on, motherfucker. Y'all ain't seen no shit like this.

[Corey Holcomb]
Hey, boy. By the time I got there, I was already two bottles and three pussies-deep. [Laughs]. You hear what I'm sayin'? It was on, boy. I was barely standin' up by the end of it. Aw, yeah, it was cool, man. We was gettin' down, havin' a good time, dancin', groovin'. Everything was smooth. They was showin' your boy love. [Laughs]. But somethin' was off. I knew somethin' was wrong, man. You know, you get that feelin' sometimes. Like, when a real, cute woman is showin' you genuine love. Ay, that ain't right. But that's when I saw Kendrick out there gettin' down wit' my lady. Man, I spent the night at her house and walked her daughter to school. You know, that means you obligated to me. But I wasn't trippin' too much, you know? Like I said, I was already three pussies-deep. You know, I got respect for your boy, Kendrick, a little bit. Yeah, everythin' was cool, man. Well, shit, man, ain't nobody told me.

["These Walls"]

[Corey Holcomb]
I got these cops runnin' up on me 'cause I hit the back of the goddamn cop car. It wasn't my fault. I'm all ready to kick it with K-Dot and them tenders, man, and these cops sweatin' me about hittin' the ass of the car, goddamnit. I told them I hit the ass. I don't give a fuck if it's a fly.

["These Walls"]

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 1- Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, Soon as I enter
I put a hurting on it
If I don’t kill it she injured
For a Long time
Summer, spring and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some 87' Locs
She’s seen them hundred spokes
And then that woman spoke
But I don’t talk back, I put my life on tracks
If that don’t work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax
It must be you, cuz I burn right through
Everything ya’ll do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar AKA “The Cash King"
Quicker than pre-cum won’t you give her a reason;
To not meet up with me like a vegan
Psssst! God-Damn I’m the fuckin man
She said fuck her man
Now she fuck with Mann
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 2- Mann]
Everytime I close my eyes I see a different dream
I pray to God that we don’t close until we reach our dreams
College tuition for daughters and I ain’t even father
Now I got a rebel at the altar call me prince or king
Six digits for me like we did to offer
I used to call me Waldo, and now they call me Walter
Yeah, I hide in them uckle pants, living without a purpose, man
But that just got my circumstances
And I mean it, if you want it, come and get it, boy
Death come in threes and you’re looking like triplets boys
In high school I climbed the roof so I could smoke my weed
The dealers knew that I was young and sold me bag of seeds
I’m chasing dreams, hoes chasing me
But I just gave the name and number like the maitre D
‘cause all I wanna do was roll up hash and smash the ass of a bitch who lived like Kim Kardashian
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 3- Mann]
She is the last straw, I’ve bend her and slip slow
My pencil draws her closer, she gets high and bends low
Long flight from my Cali mistress, to a district with red lights
Prostitutes and rich niggas, just a recipe for long nights
Shake well and all they do, I’m laying next to some girl who last night showed me things I never knew
Either I’m bending space out or I’m just bending space in
I put my heart on tracks, but it’s four AM and that chick’s still racing
One bed, two girls, three way, four times
My shame came off their clothes, it’s paradise of the mind
Absolute vodka mixed with absolute freedom
I meet my darker side and it’s a pleasure just to meet him
I’m thinking about puffing and writing while fucking
Yesterday’s gone and tomorrow ain’t come
And if tomorrow ain’t come and that’s the name that she told me
But when you hit this level, every first name is phoneme
But here, the air tastes better, weed is more potent and girls seem wetter
Days are a haze and drinks just stronger, nocturnal nigga, these nights seem longer
I’m only here for one night, it’s Disneyland for man, white girls, blue kush, red lights
America and Amster…damn[Hook: Frank Ocean]
All the spoons in my kitchen
Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend
Beend it girl, beend it girl

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Soon as I enter
I put a hurting on it if I don’t kill it she injured
For a long time, summer, spring, and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy-ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some 87 Locs
She’s seen them hundred spokes and then that woman spoke
But I don’t talk back, I put my life on tracks
If that don’t work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax, it must be you
Cause I burn right through everything ya’ll do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar AKA The Cash King
Quicker than pre-cum won’t you give her a reason
To not meet up with me like a vegan
Psst, Goddamn I’m the fucking man
She said fuck her man, now she fuck with Mann
[Hook]
All the spoons in my kitchen
Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 2: Shawn Chrystopher]
Everytime I close my eyes I see a different dream
I pray to God that we don’t close until we reach our dreams
College tuition for daughters that I ain’t even father
Now I got a redbone at the altar call me Prince Akeem
Six digits for me to complete the offer
I used to call me Waldo, and now they call me Walter
Yeah, I'm higher than them Urkel pants
Live without a purpose, man but that just cause my circumstances
And I mean it, if you want it, come and get it, boy
Death come in threes and you’re looking like triplets boys
In high school I climbed the roof so I could smoke my weed
The dealers knew that I was young and sold me bag of seeds
I’m chasing dreams, hoes chasing me
But I just get they name and number like the maître d'
‘cause all I wanna do was roll up hash and smash the ass of a bitch who live like Kim Kardashian
[Hook]
All the spoons in my kitchen
Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend
Bend it girl, bend it girl

[Verse 3: Blessed]
She is the last straw, I’ve bend her then sip slow
My pencil draws her closer, she gets high and bends low
Long flight from my Cali mistress, to a district with red lights
Prostitutes and rich niggas, just a recipe for long nights
Shake well, and all they do
I’m laying next to some girl who last night showed me things I never knew
Either I’m bending space out or I’m just bending space in
I put my heart on tracks, but it’s four AM and that chick’s still racing
One bed, two girls, three way, four times
My shame came off with their clothes, it’s paradise of the mind
Absolut vodka mixed with absolute freedom
I meet my darker side and it’s a pleasure just to meet him
I’m thinking about puffing and writing while fucking
Yesterday’s gone and tomorrow ain’t comin'
And if tomorrow ain’t comin' and that’s the name that she told me
But when you hit this level, every first name is phony
But here, the air tastes better
Weed is more potent and girls seem wetter
Days are a haze and drinks just stronger
Nocturnal nigga, these nights seem longer
I’m only here for one night, it’s Disneyland for man
White girls, blue kush, red lights, American in Amster…damnThis is special, man. As my guy Mozzy say, you know, God up top all the time—real talk, you know. Hip-hop, man. I said hip-hop.

This is a special award because of rap music. This is the thing that got me on the stage. This got me to tour all around the world, support my family and all that. Most importantly it showed me a true definition of what being an artist was.

From the jump I thought it was about the accolades and the cars and the clothes. But it’s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next listener, the next generation after that, you know what I’m saying? Hip-hop has done that for me.

I got a lot of guys in this building right now that I still idolize to this day: Jay-Z, Nas, Puff, you know. These guys showed me the game through their lyrics, from close and from afar.

So with that being said, this trophy to hip-hop, real talk. That’s love, baby. Jay for president![Intro]
Weezy wassup with it bruddah?
Tell Maestro I need to fuck over his beat real quick
Hear me?

[Hook]
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9

[Verse 1]
That's no lie, ho
Rappers out they mothafucking minds so I gotta go
Psycho on these niggas, call me Norman Bates with a poker face
Got the banger in my hand and I'm out to poke your face
.38 Special, grab it, let him have it, where the safe, we hungry
Housing authority saved my Section 8
My section be on the west side of Compton Cali, champ
Where the killers posted on the corner like a letter stamp
Let a rapper tell me I ain't better than whoever's out
I'ma knock 'em out his Force 1's once I air 'em out
Air jets flying 'cross the atlas, I made it momma, made a promise
Married to hip hop, and the maid of honor gonna be R&B
I'm fucking her too, so please hand me my condoms
Where the honeymoon in the mother fucking booth
You're fucking right, I'm the fucking truth
I put my hand on the bible
Swear to god if I lie, then I'll probably die tomorrow
Tell my momma don't feel sorrow cause her son was a gunner
They found my corpse with a rapper's head in my stomach
I'm right here, I ain't running even if the Iraqis w-was in back of me
Back against the wall I'm clapping them rapidly y'all
Would never stop what you can't see
It's like a red light when driving with Stevie
Wonder if you can understand or withstand the blast of my wrath
I steer the game with both hands while you crash
Like Earnhardt my heart to the fallen soldiers
You can either ride, or get rolled over
Sleeping on me, I put you in a coma
So please chill out before you meet the coldest
Starving every day, see my face where the bowl is
Bowl on my face, I walk while my mouth hold it
[Hook]
Hold it
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9

[Verse 2]
21 gun salute
And my soldiers killed 20 of your troops at a time
And I got about nine teens on the corner fucking with marijuana
Jive and heard about 18 rappers say that a bird can go for 17.5
Motherfuck that my sweet 16's be equivalent to about 15 pie
I was 14 when I wrote a rhyme
All I seen was 13 ghosts every time I wrote a crazy line
All these 12 bars in my verses, that's what Notorious and Pac arrived
God dammit I spit just like a Mac 11 every time
I drop jewels, you drop dimes, you pretending to be like mine
I intend to put about 10 of you rappers on channel 9
Straight up, fuck around and get ate up
Cut 'em up in 7 ways, funeral carried by 6 in 5 days you'll know I go for
Money when I sink my teeth in Carter III beats
To you from me, my son the victory is mine, I won
I'm the one
The beat was the pussy
And I cum, hard

[Verse 1]
When I jumped off the porch I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took it's course, hoarse when yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
Killers on side of me, privacy obviously was lost
For a piracy of the streets and my Odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed...
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walk down the street with no heat and run into beef when I’m just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinners smell it then start squeezing
Pellets tumbling straight at my melon, apparent reason...
Because my cousin's cuzzin a Blood
That was Blooding in public and Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, probably Kendrick I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, shoot as your remedy
Fair enough I got enemies but I don’t bang
But that's the repercussion like when your cousin’s cuzzin a blood
And you’re by yourself at the Compton parade
Good Kid
M.A.A.D City
Life or death
Is you with me?
Wassup



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & (Kobe Bryant)]
Kobe taught us to be better

(Whatever it takes)
Better dreamer
Better waker
Better stretcher
Better walker
Better talker
Better at walkin' the walk and talkin' the talk
Better blocker, better sprinter
Better loser, better winner
Just—be—better

Focus
Better friend
Better fighter, better rider
Better eater, mhmm
Better leader
Better generation, better nation
Just—be—better

[Intro: Coco O.]
Better off without you
Better off my baby
Better off without
Better off my baby
And I'm better off without you
Better off my baby
Better off my baby
Better off without you

[Verse 1: Coco O.]
I waited for you mainly
Can't believe you made me
Oh lord of daydreams
Leading on the maybes
And why you would treasure me
Search for you and rule me
Close sits on nothing
Why we should be killing

[Bridge: Quadron]
Sorrow, sorrow (Searching, searching 'em)
Crossed hearts (You crossed your heart and now you lose)
I'm better without you, yeah
I'm better without you, yeah

[Chorus: Coco O.]
Every
Is only half full in your thoughts
You get no better now
Patiently, 'cause you're so heavy in my heart
I could do better now
I'm with you
I'm with you (If you really want me to be with you than I can choose)
And you want me
I can choose my own (I could do better)
I know I can do better

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Love is life and life is love, I like to love
Every part of you, the party life can never do enough
So many obstacles the possibilities are breaking up
Can move in hospital with that extra patient you got me stuck
I'll play the prostitute if you've got the patience to pimp me
But you never put me on the strip, put it on then you strip
Put it on your fingertips and I'll kiss it off
You better not kiss me goodbye, Test my faith and kiss the cross
I'm trying to go there, take you slow there if it's alright
Tell me that you care, baby, we could share a full life
Truth and double dare that I do repair broken hearts
Cupid shot me in the dark, stupid I didn't play my part
Ask for your forgiveness, if it's worth it I can serve a purpose
If I'm st.. st.. stuttering because I'm nervous
Tell me that you love me still, promise that I'm staying still
Honesty is all I need, honestly, we can build

[Bridge 2: Coco O.]
The stakes are full now
Still, wait for you
I'm better off with you (I'm better off), yeah
I'm better off with you, yeah

[Chorus: Coco O.]
Every
Is only half full in your thoughts
You get no better now
Patiently, 'cause you're so heavy in my heart
I could do better now
I'm with you
I'm with you (If you really want me to be with you than I can choose)
And you want me
I can choose my own (I could do better)
I know I can do better

[Outro: Coco O.]
I'm with you (If you really want me to)
I can't choose life (I can't choose)
I could do better, better now



[Intro]
Man, Beyoncé, I'm mad at you
Man...

[Hook]
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times before she met Jay
See ya know
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so

[Verse 1 - Kendrick]
I remember you were 16 on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God yes, I was impressed
You was like "no no no," I was like 12 years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you were on the road
You wore braids with a bangin body
Look like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that, I was there from the start
Even when Latoya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldn't sing anyway, you deserve to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle I'm just sayin' they cool
But you? You are somethin' like Wonder Woman
And I just wanna hold your hand, bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eatin hot cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished

[Hook]
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times before she met Jay
See ya know
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so

[Verse 2]
I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
Gazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes until my girlfriend hit me
She jealous of you cause I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the "uh oh, uh oh" just like you do
She tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect
Like Ice Cube way before the Mac 10 feud
She's like "you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke"
I said "So? I'm only 500 mill away, theres still hope!"
Anyway, I had feelings even way before you got paid
And I didn't laugh when you busted your ass on the stage
And I salute Kanye for takin' up for you
I would've stole the award just to prove that I love you
But Jay should've did that I thought he had your biz-ack
What happened, Mr. Izzo? Hopico? Fredrico?
He used to be my favorite until he abandoned my diva
Now I tell everybody Nas had killed him on "Ether"

[Hook 2]
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
Hopefully I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
You never know, hmm...

[Verse 3]
I'mma sneak backstage at a Mary J Blige concert
With an "I love Mary" shirt, then find Jay-Z
And push him into a dancer, hopefully they lock lips
That's when I yell out "Sounwave! Hurry up take the pic!"
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep, they'd be sure to fight
Better yet, I'mma steal her cell, then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well, get Beyonce on the line
Then make up some bogus shit like "You don't rub the back of my knees right
So this marriage is over with
And the ring thats on my finger? Guess what? I'm throwin' it!
[Cling]...you heard the sound so you know I did"
Haha that should get 'em
That should break em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah, true that
I'mma put the plan in motion, that's for sure
But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never work

[Outro - Skit]
Yeeeea, man I hope Jay don’t be mad at me bout this song
Start-ay, Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it’ll be hot for real though?
Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughing as hard as you
Nigga got the best wife in the world and shit
Run that back though?



[Intro]
Classic, Young Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 1]
Look, swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the Ruler's apologize you ain't ruling the shit
I'm Rick Rubin in 85 with the beard thick
Dick bitch tight the movie and slanted eyes that squinch
I tell you that I'm one up, sun down then sun up
Son, I son niggas I probably fucked up your mama
No condom, it's good pussy
Pussy, tell it to your honor that this trauma is Jeffrey Dahmer
Took me too many moons set up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kicked, pushed with push broom
Man look, your man, look like sweet water
Corn bread to break under pressure if he's caught up
Big homie said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a  young boss with a bat cave
Back against the wall closer my back came back with them back pains, whoa
Tell em put my name on the blimp
Ball like I'm Derrick Rose you should know my gym
You playa's not allowed I'm sparking your game towels
And spikn' your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not this basket but rather the good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas I make you wait shake in
Blank tapes in your deck, niggas still break their neck
They hear it you need plans with the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to win
Club accounts go 15 racks when you wet like that shit
It's gotta be a sin. Hm. so Lord forgive me I'm a sinner
Hm. These hoes squeeze me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner, I coat food and the..tools make my agenda
I show fools I'm nasty like tofu I wish a
Motherfucker would get your whole career injured
This assault what a deadly weapon
Guilt your favourite rapper, favourite rapper last record
We fucked your baby actress on the map just what a blessing
Make that pussy ante up she call my dick anti-depressive
I'm really not depressed with, none of you niggas stressing
That's some of you niggas bless with the gift to carry the presence
A big in Pac and pop with..and with investments
15 minutes come up with 60 seconds
Last month I've been six hours inside of session
Came up with shit writers block niggas up in this stressing
Like who the fuck cares? who the fuck cares? Even if you get drunk up
Still be a millionaire
You could play a Santa Claus and make sure you're the whole dear
Every verse I put that bitch in the hearse, while boy stear
Uh Church to your pussy and push me get pack..
Verse that you cookie I read it my foot is here big boy

Alright
And you don't stop, and it don't stop

And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
This be that shit that make real niggas grab they dick
And bitches rubbin' on they tits as if they think this monkeys rich
Monkey see what monkey do, you monkeys never make no tips
Climbup the tree shit on you
Paranoid the shit and bricks that can build the castle
Hastle and breaking your picket fence
I know pterodactyls that still exist
Clappin if you resist to cooperate, go home and see their daughters go..
You at risk if you wear bracelet, we want your wrist
We can taste it from planet pluto
Dog Gonnit you panic just like a poodle rip out your culo then kudos
Two door Regals, El Caminos, and two more
Sevilles with the whitewalls, wipe it off with my shoe ho
I feel you just menthol, meant to get smoked and sent off to your maker
Trace your..with no the ..coach
Mean ain't no hood high up in California and G watches snoops

Jay Rock, SchoolBoy, Top Dog Entertainment

Then you see game, now we finna change
The whole fucking game smash it know you lames
Compton you should already know the name yeah we pop it

And if we had it once then we got it right back
And if you ever had it you won't have it no more
And if we see the back though we to the front door
Taking your bread, crucifying everybody off with their head
This is freestyle of the top of the dome
And you know Big Boi that's my home
What's up?

And you do stop, and you do stop, and you do stop
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do stop



[Verse 1]
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear into how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was leery
Hopped out the gas station, a homeless man with 100 grand
Who passed me just asked for 10 grand, stressing about dry land
Blue skies, powder blue skies then crack open
Piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it, told him beat it
Contributed money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said "my son, temptation is one thing that I defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothing less, nothing more"
I told him I didn't have it then close my door
Tell me how much how much a dollar costs?
And this a freestyle beginning
And if you know me you know K.Dot TDE winning
We are the champions, we disagree
You can't see it then you best believe
This the cypher, I need y'all to throw some words up

[Interlude]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
They wanna know the question
K.Dot, everybody stressin'
This is the message that I'm kickin' too wicked, straight from Compton
If you come around my city you'll get stomped in
The neighborhood Watts and Long Beach
Boy, you out of reach
This is TDE, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock
Schoolboy Q, we hot, you not
This a freestyle off the top of the dome
Big Boy city, you know my home
I'mma represent every time I come to the lab
If you wanna see me, homeboy, get the cab
Cause you can't ride with me, you can't see the streets
You can't see us, it's TDE
My homeboy Dave gon' fly you straight in
Sippin' on that juice and gin and that's a classic
Coming straight from Dre and Snoop
If you want us please jump inside the group
Because you don't deserve it if you don't not
This is straight hip hop, this is off the top
And when I rock you feel it
If it's us and then you hear it
Please consider that the best agree
The top number one emcee

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Now when I flip it I flip the beat as my enemy
You thought it was taming me, on point like a widow's peak
Deliver the bars that everyone agree
They say the number one emcee, best believe
I love the pianos and I love the flow
I love the snare drum, I love... oh, I can't cuss on radio
Because if I do they just might let me go
I'm side to the best, I ride to the best
I represent the West, please don't try to test
Because you will get disabled
From best of flows I know, you hate it
Everybody wanna rock, but they can't
Because they come from the street of Rosecrans [?]
We drop it off the top of the backboard for real
And that's a swish, that's a net, alley oop
I feel that we are the champions and these Gods'll stomp you
I come through your block and crash everything that you want or put out to
And if you know my flow then you know how it go
If you know Death Row then you know Eazy, then you know Dre
Then you know Snoop and you know we don't play
But anyway I need y'all to flip the beat
Because my words always compete with the best

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
I said we don't stop, boy, we run hip hop
Boy, we run rap, boy, this is Top Dawg
D-O-T, D-A-W-G, K-D-O-T, C-P-T
L-B-C West, W-A-T-T-S, Jay Rock, he don't play
Niggas and guards, projects
What you want? We can collide anytime with the biceps
But this ain't no strong arm, buddy, this just a freestyle
Off top of the brain, boy, you know I get wild
You know I'm so foul, you know I'm off of the top
You know this hip hop, you know I cropped
The roof from the birth of the Earth
And I've been doing this since church
With the small slacks, with the soft suspender
If you rapping like that, homeboy, we suspend ya
We contenders, we on the top off the map
We on the top off the globe and yeah this real rap
From the bottom of the soil since Adidas and Run DMC
Sprinting like cheetahs, we run this game and beat me
And [?] man on the beat right now
He gon' flip it and please believe
Every 16 bars is like ours
And if you want it then we 'bout to take charge, what's up?

[Verse 5]
Tonight's the night I jump off my shit
Deep cover on the incognito tip
And every time the words flip the emcees step, but I don't trip
I keep walking, keep pushing and put 'em in a coffin
You often looking for the best, I'm here
We talking, you looking for the stress, you there
Keep walking, you looking for the West, right here
You stalking the flow, you often to know
I want y'all to know been doing this since the days of Death Row and Ruthless
I've been ruthless, the coupe it been roofless
You spit, the words be toothless
But it get like that because you feel it
I got Rikki on my side and she chillin'
Big Boy on my side and he willin'
They say that he writing my bars, forget it

[Interlude]

[Verse 6: Big Boy]
It's my lyrics, it's my pen
It's my paper as I begin
I've been writing for Kendrick for a long time
And he's been reciting my rhymes
So for those out there who didn't know
Big Boy gets on the mic and he kicks an ill flow
Then about 10 years ago I got this call
From a little dude, I said "yes, yes, y'all"
He said "uncle Big Boy, I wanna start rapping"
I said "what's up, little homie?", he said "I wanna start trapping
I wanna start capping, I wanna start hitting the studio"
I said "slow down a little bit, bro"
He said "holler, I wanna rock the spot"
I said "what's your name?", he said "my name is K.Dot"
I said "K.Dot, okay, I think I feel you
But this the way I wanna instill you
First off let me write what you gon' say
Record it and then press play"
He said "okay", it was very rude that I took K.Dot on
He was one of my little students
So he just sat in class
He was looking at me, said "do I get a pass?
Do I get an A,B,C,D,E or do I fail?"
I said "you doing well", his head started to swell
Then all of a sudden he came to me
He said "there's this dude in Compton that has TDE"
I said " Top Dawg? Hold on, that is my partner
Don't stop right there because I think [?]"
When the dude is coming with a contract
But I said "hold on, let me look at that"
I said "okay, he want this, he wants these points
He want this, but don't smoke any joints
You my lil partna, how old are you on the scene?"
He said "big boy I been a student, about, I'm about sixteen"
I said okay keep going, and then all of a sudden
He started doing uhh, he started doing these shows
And he got poetic, he got energetic
Spotetic, all those -etics
Any more -etics, any more edits
Then o-etics, and then a o-etics
So then I came back and he was still in class
And then I gave em that pass
I said TDE, the real Macoy
Can't forget Jay Rock, can't forget Schoolboy
And so I put the whole crew together, but from the background
Before I got in they had a lack sound

[Intro]
Uh, I see everybody wanna play gansta now, huh
Well you know what niggas
I'mma just play Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Feel this
Uh, lemme shit on these niggas man

[Verse 1]
Look homie I'm not your crip or your blood
Homie I'm just Kendrick
See me other than him might plead the fifth amendment
Hard headed nigga shit all it take is an instant
Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant
Say you bust your gun, but never totin' it
You say your man is dope I think he's smoking it homie
Why you provoking it don't mean to boast a bit
But you can call me a fly cause your boy be on some shit
Pussy fly so all the girlies think I'm the shit
I've got it to spend but still never buy them shit
You better guard your bitch
‘Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on holmes
Something like a lightswitch
Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag for the Porsche
‘Cause it got a better steering grip
Young but been a man and you won't understand
Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceiling fan
[Hook]
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me

[Verse 2]
(Nigga) I'm from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan
And the average man got a heat up in his dickie pants
I got some plans, to stack riches
Own 76′s like a Philadelphian
You don't know but now I'm focused like camera lens
And if I know your mans I might give a second chance
‘Cause I don't wanna hurt you
Have ‘em running in herzels
Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
Crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue
Been an artist since Prince played in Color Purple
Weed smoke hydro blow on that purple
2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel
I suspend they murk you, what you lying for?
You know you ain't eating like feed the children commercials
Man my children circle around your block
Let out shots and be home 30 minutes before they curfew
[Hook]
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me

[Outro]

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Straight to the block, to the hood, to a spot
Cocaine to a rock, duece duece in a sock
Every dollar closer to a drop
Every drop is closer to a cop
Every cop is closer to a cell
Hit the cell your ticket right to hell
No job, no bail
No fam, no mail
Institution another nigga, fail
Go from pussy to a prison tale
Fuck that, I quit while I'm ahead
Ship my music off with Amistad
Turn it up and hear the ghetto pledge
Live righteous nigga like my brother said
King Tut, Martin Luther, Malcolm X, but I'm the shoota'
Top ramen, knowledge for the noodle
Finally gettin' praised
Yeah, kudos
Doing bad, still love the need
Connect said it's something up his sleeve
Said, I rather bust off them keys
Yeah nigga birds and the beez

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Wanna do a song, but it's hard to carry on
And my daughter hungry sitting home
And my girl, she said she feeling lone
I can tell it's over in her tone
Only time I call is for a loan
She be stressing, so depressing
Always worried every time a lil nigga gone
Stay strong for the future, stick together, yeah suture
Get a couple wipps, yeah Kunta
Schoolboy, but gangsta was his tutors
Say the money be the root of evil, look around and see what it do to people
Veins full of heroin using PCP inject the body with a needle
Lord help us, swear to god, dope dealers, get a job
Keep it real this shit ain't really cool, being in a cell, you ain't alive
Niggas quick to show out over cheese, love to help the devil do a deed
So I rather bust of them keys?
Yeah nigga, birds and the beez

[Bridge]
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
(Birds and the beez)

[Hook]
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Q, I wanna see you do your thang
Entertainment business living limelight
Hop on every track and move them trains
Show these motherfuckers that you been tight, then they ever been
It's evident that you intelligent but you can't escape that life
And for you, my nigga
I would sacrifice myself to make it just to see you hold the mic
And hit the stage and rock the set
But it's hard to change when your from the set
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death
Life of crack I’d like to hang you by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them runway jets
Fly to Singapore, one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to god, its hard out here for a young black men to live
If you dont do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
My nigga won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter
Please don't let her grow up life without a father
Look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy
All she need is love, put that shit aside
At the same time know they got to eat
Know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HGC, no A/C
Got the block hot, you keep runnin', cop say freeze
Blue pill, red pill, choose now, birds or the bees

[Bridge]
Birds or the beez
Birds or the beez

[Hook]
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change

[Outro]
Count my change
Count my change

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Death to Molly]

Mira adentro de mi alma
Puedes encontrar oro y ser rico (Y ser rico)
Mira adentro de tu alma
Quizás no encuentres nada
Porque nunca estuvo ahí
Oh, no estuvo ahí, oh
Siente el cambio
Siente que se asoma una nueva vida
Es peligrosa
Mira, tú tranquilo, solo no mates mi vibra

I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!

[Outro]
Trick, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that -sy on a pedestal
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherf-in' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!

[Outro]
Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car!
Come on, we finna roll out!
I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!

[Intro: Emeli Sandé & Kendrick Lamar]
You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I don't know you, I can tell your energy is dangerous
You don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating
Save your breath I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So what, So what?, So bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
I'm a break out and then hide every lock

Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Hol' up
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks
But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like "wait"
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent)
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Up in the clouds, me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down, can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink
Running through that bitch like it's my house
All up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to
Empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait
I've been in my wave like 20 years straight
I've been on my vibe like 20 years straight
Don't fuck up my high, fuck up my high
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
An still be straight (still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint, smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16
That I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen
But now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo
Bitch see you at Woodstock, ah!

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single

[Verse 1]
Okay, what these niggas hollin' 'bout?
Catastrophic K-Dot, bet I bring them dollas out
Talk that shit, potty mouth, walk that shit, pep stroke
Guarantee yo girl, get sliced like Kimbo
Bitch, I'm in the club, homies blowin' indo
Turned up, throwin' up signs to the ceiling roof
Sipping on that hundred proof and I'm dressed in Gucci too
And these hoes jock a nigga so I holla, "What it do?"

[Chorus]
Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single
Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single

[Verse 2]
Move somethin', move, move somethin'
Got these stacks full of hundreds with an icon woman
On my left, my right, my right, my left, I'm throwed
Beyonce's, two Halle's and three Keyshia Cole's
Wait a minute (Wait a minute), can I pop my tags? (Pop my tags)
Can I do the fool? (Do the fool) Can I swing my rag? (Swing my rag)
I'm a Hub City maniac, bitch, get it right
Bartender, hurry up, put them bottles on ice

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single

[Verse 3]
I got a hundred dollas on me (I'm rich, bitch)
Baby girl, I know you wanted (This dick)
All righty I might be in some loafers or Nikes
Faded blazer or white tee, either way she gon' like me
I get it crackin' for no reason at all
Lookin' you see that I ball like a pupil that's soft
And I can tell you don't have what I have
Which is a lot of juice, motherfuck swag

[Chorus]
Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single
Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single

I got a hundred dollas on me (I'm rich, bitch)

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets
Making my conscience ask me
"Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly
[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, "Oh shit, wait"
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly
[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God

[Intro]
Dick hard like rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo

[Verse]
The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from 1980 somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Whoa
Burnin’ my leather-
(Nah I’m just fuckin’ wit cha)

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar + Jay Rock]
Let 'em die, dead—Black Hippy
Pfffft—and we don't give a fuck
Hell, nah, nigga
This conglomerate so cool, Rock, we could freeze L.A., nigga
Black Hippy
Kendrick Lamar
I tell 'em like this:

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar + ScHoolboy Q + Jay Rock + Ab-Soul]
Ring the alarm or wake to a bomb
You ain't a rapper, you Elton John, holdin' your john
I got a ton of croutons in the Louis Vuitton
That's big bread the chickens are flying flocks when I call 'em
Paul and Masson, half drunk, stuck in a poem
Light matches underwater while I'm bracing the storm
I'm cool and I'm calm, laid back, smoking a farm
Socking the shit out of niggas till I'm breaking my arm
Up in my zone, two blunts, cup of patron
.45 on me, shoot you if you fuck with me wrong
No homo'—pause—that's your life and it's gone
Flat line you, don't put your life in the song
I never drove a fast car—I almost ran over
Tracy Chapman, she said, "Drive slow," I said, "Fuck off"
Ab-Soul—wha'sup, y'all? Other than your sub-par
Above all? I'm a heaven gate—above all
Fuckin' great, and every time we in the stu'?

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q + Kendrick Lamar + Jay Rock]
We cook that, chop that—what's that? That's crack
Yeah, homie—this is what we do
3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
Ow, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we—
Cook that, chop that—what's that? That's crack
Yeah, homie—this is what we do
3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch

[Verse 2: Jay Rock + Kendrick Lamar + ScHoolboy Q + Ab-Soul]
The Black Hippies, the bag full, the bag empty
Spunt it all at the car lot, then crash quickly
I'm tryna come with enough power to pass 50
I'm talking 50-bill, you niggas don't fit the bill
You niggas don't keep it real, you fake as Pamela's titties
I pound kitties, then hit the club with dogs with me
Tan Polos, no socks, chop Dickies
Tan coupe, no top, bumping Biggie
Blowing sticky, before the group, been a hippy
Nifty fifty, all blue—real Crippy
Big money, long stocks—ask Pippy
Mask on, one sock—I gets busy
I smoke blacks, relax, and watch Walt Disney
Puff squares, pace in circles until I'm dizzy
Speakin' of Disney—fantasies, I had many
I used to hate on Mickey Mouse 'cause he had Minnie
Anyway—every time we in the stu'?

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q + Kendrick Lamar + Jay Rock]
We cook that, chop that—what's that? That's crack
Yeah, homie—this is what we do
3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
Ow, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we—
Cook that, chop that—what's that? That's crack
Yeah, homie—this is what we do
3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q + Jay Rock + Kendrick Lamar + Ab-Soul]
Ahhhhhhh!
Napped through my final, made enough, richer than Lionel
Fuckin' bitches on my job—cummin' harder than rhino
Break through the spinal, laid back, bumpin' my vinyl
Navigation on the scopes, easy to find 'em
Find you and I'm right behind you—laid back, puffin' a blunt
Gat on my lap, constantly talkin' shit, I'mma dump
Your homies acting charged up, they can still get jumped
Take ya chain, ash the kush for all you punks
However you want, whenever you want, you all can get it
Contagious, it's mad syphilis, blazing this God-giftedness
Die over death sentences, flow hot—plus the beat knock
Like J-witnesses, tell 'em I killed the witnesses
Gifted as twenty Christmases, itchin' to blow
Like twenty bitches with mouths that need a dick in it—wow
I ran rap for half a mile then got tired
Laid down and realized that I was lying
You fuckin' crazy!
Ha—and every time we in the stu'?

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q + Kendrick Lamar + Jay Rock]
We cook that, chop that—what's that? That's crack
Yeah, homie—this is what we do
3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
Ow, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we—
Cook that, chop that—what's that? That's crack
Yeah, homie—this is what we do
3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch



[Intro]

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock checking in, you niggas checking out
When I grip the pen, that's how it is when I'm on the mic
I'm the People's Choice
The streets never lie
I paid dues so I'm self made
And if you got something shitty to say
You get slept or slayed
Haters in the shade
They running they mouth
They steady talking till the gun in they mouth
Go ahead and chit chat
That's when you hear the click-clack then its all over
Too late to bleed, squeeze then flee
Bleed the streets, bleed the beats
True story
I'm straight gutter, all guts
No glory
You niggas whack with them same raps
Y'all bore me
You're all killers and dealers
With scrilla like Kobe
Cut it out, you rappers papier-mache
K. Lamar my nigga, go ahead and take 'em away

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I said we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
My flow China white
Like a sheep in the snow
I go deep as the Bible, I could debate with the pope
And you rappers go down hill
Like a ski on the slope
I been a boat with Papi
But I ain't trying to cop no work
I'm trying to cop me the boat and some more property
I told Rock
"We gotta be more then just a commodity
Make the whole name and entity to infinity"
Y'all want me off the juice, no grenadine
Could stop me from thinking presidential like the scattered brains of Kennedy
After I shot, duck down
So the crowd won't witness me
Now, could somebody locate Mr. Shakur?
And tell these Tupacs, they two shots, away from two blocks
Of being neighbors with the Almighty Lord
I put your best material in, then fast forward
Kendrick, signing off
I'm sure your signature's forged, boy

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
They say I'm headed to the county and they said it's for a murder
In a zone like a touchdown
No need to be turned down
Catch a fade, mandatory
Walk up in the dorm room just me and my heart
Let it start
Where you from?
I bang back
Start pushing back the rack
So I guess it's time to scrap
Run that, Look
I Whooped his ass for an hour
Made his nigga have to drag him in the shower
Survival techniques from the streets don't apply in here
Just barbarious niggas who'll try your fears, ruthless
Little church choir and Hell's fire
And lemme see you sing your ass out of this one
Smashed out a victim
Should've kept push ups in your routine
Eating tuna for your protein
Most niggas turn scary, fags get buried
Snatch a mothafucka's commissary
Dont worry I'm a gangster

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Look
First name Herbert
Last name Steven
Don't call it my government
Cause I don't know none of them
As far as rap
I'm running it like I'm getting robbed
Target wasn't quite my target
That's why I quit my job
These niggas better hop on board
When my ship sets sail and I sell a few records
Sipping Guinness and set a few records
Enough is never enough
I gotta do extra
I gotta go the distance
I gotta prosper, I gotta put my mamacita
In that big casa
I gotta be the
Realest if not the illest to spit a verse
God MC, Pick a church
Hallelujah
Don't let the curly hair fool you
My hair ain't quite wool
And my feet ain't bronze
And it's inadequate thinking I used to run Nazareth
Imagine if this hoodie was a crown of thorns
You wish you had the stamina to go that hard
Get your punchlines up, then maybe we could spar
Your lyrics should make a point, then maybe we could score
Then maybe I could show you how three met-a-four
(Beat runs out)
Metaphorically speaking I'm more indecent
Then papa bear getting distracted enjoying his porridge, peep it
In a war, I rip a warrior to pieces
Make a Domino effect, like I'm delivering pizzas
(Kendrick:"Let him go, let him keep going")
And if that ain't a fact, then neither is Jesus
Black-lipped bastard
Puffing on a pasture
I hit a chick till she holla' like she caught the Holy Ghost
Then I passed her, holy smokes
I bring disaster to every quote
You a Shasta to a Coke
I'm a master
Sensei with a pen raised
Build up bricks, just to break
In the dojo blowing do-do
And to be frank
I'm so hot I make the snow flake
On any day
Ab-Soul, now you know mane

[Outro]



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
This what you really want, huh?
Turn me up, Ali

[Sample: Donny Hathaway]
I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Black lip bastard, pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain
See, I too have gone insane
Before I fall I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name
Lead shower, Anna Peebles hour, bitch stand the rain
This what y'all really want
Let me get it back Ali
When we do- when we do interviews, don't ask me 'bout no movements
Yeah I'm good
No crews, no-no posses, no cliques
If it ain't 'bout TDE I don't wanna hear that shit, bitch
Look inside my parkin' garage and see a collage
Of every person I despised since the moment I turned five
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even fallin' off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj (so soft)
Eat that pink pussy like it's Friday
Bust one, roam and reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too (hey baby)
Don't fuckin' take me for some kind of fool
I'm kinda the reminder of knowin' Compton ain't kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views
Countertops, we hop over, hit the register, then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
Before I climb this pedestal
And make you catch my fuckin' stool (bitch)
K.Dot, leave 'em grievin' on evenin' news
Even when society break even, I'll break rules

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I told niggas, caught wrecked, then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers, nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
Like a cliché to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretchin' the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or they depressed, eatin' yogurt in bed
Solar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait, I'm straight, you a gay couple
I ain't thirsty for the deal, wait and make 'em pay double
I'm anxious, when the bacon on the table, I need a muzzle
You're basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was runnin' L.A., now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? I'm a bastard with black lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
I'm awkward, dog, I'm tryna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis, ask 'em

[Interlude: Ab-Soul, ScHoolboy Q, & Kendrick Lamar]
And all we do is it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it (nigga squad)
(This what you really want)
All we do is do it
And all we do is it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it (nigga squad)
(This what you want, I give up
Let Puff Daddy talk to you
The real Puff Daddy)

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Figg side, black nine, black lips, smoke time
Fuck this rap shit, I'm active
Suckin' on titties since I was eight
Hoodie with my shades, I ain't tryna be fake
So don't be talkin' to me, pussy
Runnin' your gums like you be Loc'ing
When the world know that you're nookie
Rookie, softer than infant fabric, I won't have it
When the gun drawn, get rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tatted
Know my niggas movin'
You hesitatin' to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doin'?

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Perpetratin', bitches poppin' Percocet and percolatin'
Freelance for God but do the work of Satan
Whatever works
I'm clever with the words if you haven't noticed yet
Lightyears ahead, I'm bright and I like to get oral sex
Soul brother number one plus one
Gettin' fed like where drugs and guns come from

[Verse 5: Jay Rock]
All we do is do it, shittin' on the competition
Takin' heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music
You niggas don't move me, you niggas just movies
Cut straight to them credits and hit you with a Uzi
Peel off in a dullies, truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, poke on some coochie
I'm just fuckin' around, enough with them fairy tales
But I bust heads for real, go 'head—
I'm Jay Rock, you lil' niggas beneath me
How you gon' dance with the devil with two left feet?
Peep, thinkin' you sweet, but you weak
Talkin' out of turn'll leave all of your teeth in the street
Mama taught you better, never clash with a giant
Unless you David, remember, my nigga, I'm not Goliath
Feel the wrath of this titan
Hit some water, call it Poseidon
Wig out, then hit your ass with a trident
Money on the table my nigga, you know I'm all in
If rap was a drink, you wine, nigga I'm all gin
Hundred proof, recruit a hundred troops who love to shoot
No fluke, my nigga, you know that's what us hunters do
East side up, Watts City mayhem
Choppers, they sprayin' from AM to PM
I'm the silent assassin of the four-headed dragon
Black Hippy blastin' a .50 out the back of the Benz Wagon
Toe-taggin' wack rappers off G.P
You can't see me, your vision ain't 3D
You smokin' on that seaweed, we rollin' up that kiwi
And the Backwood lighted, we high for like three weeks
You payin' for that pussy, but we always get freebies
Top Dawg that ho and throw it like a frisbee, it's history
You know the night and day is ours
Top Dawg conglomerate, Hiii Power, bitch

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Is this what y'all really want?
This Black Hippy shit what y'all really want?
When I'm in interviews, don't ask me 'bout no crews
No posses, no cliques, don't tell me who's gettin' it
I don't give a fuck, nigga
I just paid— I just paid six figures in taxes, nigga
Off Section.80, on some independent shit
Uncle Sam talkin' 'bout, "you an old lost relative," nigga fuck you
K-Dot said it, not Kendrick
Ab-Soul the rawest motherfucker on the planet, nigga
T.D.E., solar system, Control System, beyotch

[Intro]
(Why I go easy?)
(Know why I go easy)
Wait

[Verse 1]
King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction

[Bridge]
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, your resentment, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision, kings did it
King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!

[Verse 2]
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef
[Outro]
What do you stand for?
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give all, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
KING! KING! KING! KING! KING!
I am T'Challa[Intro: Trayvon Ray Cail & ScHoolboy Q]
Our experience to where we have parents in our lives that were showing us everything
Like didn't nobody walk us, our hand and show love like you do this and don't do that
It wasn't like that coming up in our mothafuckin' community
We grew up off of cigarillos... we grew up off of second row, acting like them
A worldwide blade, a real strength....
Yeah that's on the regular
Smokin' the gas on the regular, man
Know what I mean
Word
Sippin' on Hen, that's the regular
Know what I mean

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Pissy sofas, sharin' food with roaches, uh
On gangsta Crip, my poppa was a bitch
Left me where hope just don't exist
And every neighbor got a fence
With bars on windows, my mom's slavin' for the rent
Throwin' dices, GT Dyno groovin'
Where you hang, we shootin'
You slip, we stiffin'
Creative Crippin', uh
Bitches stoppin' traffic
This the type of shit that make the MAC a classic
Reason I'm a pussy magnet
She learned to carry package
I been the best at rappin', uh
I'm hot as Vegas
Your favorite rapper broke, he don't get this paper
But claim he got a kilo, been born in '93 though
He tryna fool the people
Maaaaaan
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The joke's on you, mothafucka
The loc is on you, mothafucka
I warned you, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Ain't nothin' changed but the change
Let's put our brains away from gangs
Crips and Bloods the old and new slaves
Shit we even changed our names
Tiny somethin' Lil Shane while we bang
But yo, y'all ain't hearin' me
My homie facin' life, told me that my pride my biggest enemy
But you keep your eyes in that dark
Your mind, it greys your heart
I wrote these rhymes days apart
Most of us caught before we can expand our thoughts
How your grandmother see your corpse?
How your big homie make your life a book?
Left you for dead cause he ain't lead you, right
But I'm gon' freedom write
Let's put the rags down and raise our kids
Let's put the guns down and blaze a spliff
Let's do it now, man, no buts or ifs
It took a Blood to get me Pringle chips
You can learn to fly or take the ladder
Real nigga shit, all lives matter, both sides
Maaaaaan
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The joke's on you, mothafucka
The loc is on you, mothafucka
I warned you, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Been ready
Jay, I been ready
HOV, I been ready
They say patience

[Verse 1: Kendrick]
Everybody wanna know why my game plan so strong
Cuz' I ain't gotta think with a light bulb on
Nigga I eat, sleep, and shit rap; I never relax, been a busybody since I was born
"Is he really fucking with Sean?"
I reply, "His pick, I would take a tool on."
Dolce brown nigga, I'm right now, you ain't gotta wait later
Where the CD at? Put it in the disc player
Tell ho ride to it, I do it like none other
K-Dot, definition of a young motherfucker with a problem
"Future of the West Coast" I am
And that's real tough
Southern California, Angels, AKA LA Sharks
Make comparisons when I seen him duck
Man you think "What was to Pac and Big, before?"
And that was before
I picked up a pen, and when I did, my thumb and my index sore
And then I started writing with it
Found that it flows better, like a Venice Beach sea shore
He don't wear the same clothes as ya'll
He is cut from a different cloth
Ya boy is cool, but I'm a different frost
Like igloo, every time I come off
Every time I take off
Pandemonium when I take off
They hanging on the wing of that G4
30,000 feet and still won't fall
Why you do that for?
Why you had to sell out that store
You made my record sales come up short
My reply is that it ain't my fault
Blame God

[Hook: Kendrick]
I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)
I can't wait when its my time (My time)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)

[Verse 2: Kendrick]
When the lights get dark
And every body quiet, know its my part
I might start a riot
The main event
Bulletproof under that black tent, you can't shoot through shit
I never played the bench
Star Point Guard
Never pass up money, I'm a ball hog
Touch anything I get my hands on, into pushin' like Ray Charles
I never had no flaws
"Ooos" and "Ahhs" after every bar
Take your bitch, then give her back
For no reason for, just because, ya'll actin hard
I'm bein myself
And I got some plastic under my belt, so rest assured
You don't want your moms thinkin' bout pullin' that hospital cord
Went from a Honda Accord, to a Bentley Azure
Back seat got a flock of broads
And I ain't gotta say to kiss it, just like "Sure"
Momma gon' clean or fix it
Use Terrific, Easter Brum????????
All it need is a little season on
Who said a veteran can't be so young?
I sound better than half ya'll on
Damn K. Dot, let me see your arm
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
Princess cut looks stupid dumb
Eyes close shut, all I see is dollar signs
And I won't get enough till I'm layed in the grave or hand cuffed up bout one time
No Lie
Blame God

[Hook]
[Hook 1: Kendrick]
I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)
I can't wait when its my time (My time)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)



[Intro]
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

[Verse 1]
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say

[Chorus]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Verse 2]
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like "It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight"
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
"Fuck police" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son

[Chorus]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Intro: Bēkon]
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
"Hello ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it."
She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life."

{Gunshot}

[Bridge: Bēkon]
Is it wickedness?
[Outro: Eric Bolling & Kimberly Guilfoyle]
Lamar stated his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, quote:
"And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'."
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it[Intro, Clip from Denzel Washington in Training Day]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
This is a public service announcement
We call it Blood Sport
I had to do one too, I sorry! I'm a competitor
Oh my god it about to get hideous
I hope ya niggas know you history

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Homie go ask Doc (talk about me)
Homie go ask Nas (and he'll tell ya)
Homie go ask Jay (young fella)
But when you ask them all (don't be jealous)
I'm the best in LA. In LA
Or wherever the fuck that you stay

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
It's all copastetic. Hip-hop no longer face Armageddon
Call me Bruce Willis
No call me lieutenant tinted windows on the black benz
So they only see it late nights like Jay Leno
I fuck twice your girlfriend probly told you we can't fuck
No she lying
Oh my god I am the best rapper under 25 you can underline it
You abusing the game you defiant
Disobedient student need attention
Have parent conference I'll be there, Just let me know what classroom you in my son
I am Dwyane Wade of recording
You more like Kobe Bryant with no endorsements
That's like Shaq at the freethrow, pointless
I'm equivalent to a Earl Boykins, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues
I suppose I handle the rock well
I do hoes like Stockton and Malone: make my pick then roll
The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
You washed up like Nick Van Exel.
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench
Let's get deeper in these NBA statistics
My team something like the retro Celtics
Which means consecutive championships
Which means I'm Larry Bird's equivalent
To the way I do a verse he handle the ball
The same way I handle it with no pen
I call Jay Rock when I wanna dish it off
He bang like Vince Carter when he first saw NBA Court
Alley oop the court let him do what he want
Bang. Aw fuck it let's talk more sports
How bout football?
I run the game like Walter Payton back 1984
I'm pass you niggas like Peyton Manning
Play the field like Ray Buchanan
When I kick it like Morton Anderson it gets scary
Weight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry
Hip-hop cops on me I dodge them like Barry
Sanders... John Madden hold your commentary
Keep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion
Should I keep going?
Aw fuck it let me keep going
I'mma do it like the '97 T Owens
Not the ‘07 T Owens
T Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin
Y'all need to work on y'all defense, I train like Warren Sapp on the weekend
Maneuver like Warrick Dunn
I'm just having a little fun have some with me
Let's go baseball now the '94 Ken Griffey
One man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza
MVP of LA, call the doctor
I came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something
It’s about time for halftime reporting
I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man
I know you good with the right but you still ain’t nice till you do it with the left hand
You ain’t nice till you play all positions
Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min
I got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend
I’m a get you in, I’m a take you out, I’m a stick it in
You might say… ouch
Just let me score one time
Dribble my balls to the floor one time
I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan
I am the Jeff Gordon of recording
I am Tony Hawk if I was skateboarding
I am Michael Irv before the coke snortin'
Aw fuck it I’m what’s ever important
After this you gon applaud him
If not, fuck it I’m blood sportin'
Homie I’m blood sport…
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Ya’ll niggas ran out of time to get ya’ll shit together man

This what kings do, rake down plans with speeches
This what kings do, make sure mama is right, yup

And this how kings move, yo, hoe your money and invest wise
Whether you selling buttons or select pies

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Yes, lawd, huh
Hail Mary's in the sky (Hail Mary's in the sky)
False prophets get buried alive (alive)
Head on the throne, 'cause that's where I reside (reside)
Ways of the world, the weak won't survive
Somethin's in the water (the water)
Ayy, my nigga, we lawless (lawless)
Please move with caution
Who set the fairway? (fairway)
Damn right, I need all this (all this)
Yeah, Jack, I need all this, eyy

[Post-Chorus: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Hittas acquitted with fingerprints on the Glock
Screamin', "We gon' make it" like two-thirds of The LOX
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Pow pow, becomes, blah blah

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Blood on my hands, I'ma need hot agua
You gon' meet yo' maker, I won't say it in Patois
Hope I strike a nerve like a package of matches
You might wanna bypass, this smoke ain't gas trick
A prince-turned-pauper tryna to do like kings do
Sweatin' in chess games, tryna move like kings move
You should slow your roll before you drown in a moat
He tried to channel balance, but never found the remote
Killers on the prowl still juggin' off a lick
Still a— with a double for his *bleep*
Common politics, everlastin' mayhem
Draw to stick you for your figures, that's how they hang man
So what's your game plan if you got one?
You aimin' at passengers with a shotgun? Whoa
The aftermath is you in the scope
It's warfare, is war fair? No
You understand? It's probably better you don't
Just keep a dock on standby, charter a boat
Ships set sail and planes depart
The big picture's in motion, are you playin' your part?
Before the lights get dark and the curtains get closed
Are you playin' your role?
As told by an organized criminal
In general, get off my genitals, I got your general

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hail Mary's in the sky (Hail Mary's in the sky)
False prophets get buried alive (alive)
Head on the throne, 'cause that's where I reside (reside)
Ways of the world, the weak won't survive
Somethin's in the water (the water)
Ayy, my nigga, we lawless (lawless)
Please move with caution
Who set the fairway? (fairway)
Damn right, I need all this (all this)
Yeah, Jack, I need all this, eyy

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I had to be about nine when I first had seen it
Low-lows pulled up outside of the Ralph's
After a car show at Dominguez
They had a disagreement, they had to air out (air out)
Just another day in Del Amo
Fo' sho, man down, mando
(Thank) thank God I never had to knock your partner off
Or be another casualty of war, amen
There's four footprints in the sand where I walk
I never claimed to be a saint at all
Four Russians trippin' with hollow tips
And a Kalashnikov, aimed at y'all (kla kla kla!)
No, Soulo, ho, kept it clean
Ridin' dirty, jury would have gave me thirty
Herbie love buggin' out, hit the target blindfolded
Electorial college devoted
To hit the score, to write the score that's not a metaphor
Ragin' against the machinery, tapin' up the scenery
You gotta keep the piece to keep the peace
Got dough, squad up and mopped the block up for a cleanin' fee

[Outro: James Blake]
I don't need you to change
I don't need you to change
Yourself (get, get away, get away)
But I've got to get away (get, get away, get away)
I've got to get away (get, get away, get away)
For my health (get, get away, get away)
(Get, get away, get away)
Be as free as you can (get, get away, get away)
Be as free as you can (get, get away, get away)
Away from me (get, get away)
I tried to be a saint like everybody else



[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
(Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with y'all
(Bitches all up in my business) I can't fuck with y'all
(Industry of counterfeits) I can't fuck with y'all

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
While I'm here and every day I hear
Your bullshit, self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up, in the building, we get busy and say

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like
A to the A to the L-I-Y-A-H, give it up 2 times
Then give it right back, don't blow my high

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
(Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with y'all
(Bitches all up in my business) I can't fuck with y'all
(Industry of counterfeits) I can't fuck with y'all

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Look at my life then look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
Time'll never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans
Eyes of a coward, I understand
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Sip Dom Pérignon, when we finish, we say

[Pre-Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like
But never will I ever forget Left Eye
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
And a button on your lips, don't blow my high

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
(Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with y'all
(Bitches all up in my business) I can't fuck with y'all
(Industry of counterfeits) I can't fuck with y'all

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Alori Joh]
Now everybody sing this shit
I'm sending him a four-page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss (a kiss)
And when I write him, he better
Get it on time
Look at my life, and look at yours
Get some ambition why you bored

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bear witness
Watch me get it in like underage club attendants
The roof go back like it's vintage
The young boy's back to burn your village, the fire touching the ceiling burn
What's God willing when HOVA retired?
Now he back, guess he got some competition on his hands
Who is that? I...am...
K-Dot, I'm claustrophobic don't put me in the box with you niggas
You can't categorize me
I'm already convinced that I'm the hottest nigga out
Any comments? I thought so
You niggas is gassed up like ALCO
Scared to play Madden on All-Pro
Step your game up
I'm here to fuck up niggas' barcodes
SoundScan'll never read your albums again (whoo!)
I take 99.9% of your fans
The last one left is your moms (and she even iffy about you...)
Ain't nothing gifted about you
Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor get it up out you
I'm 'bout to, send him right there, he shark food
Piranhas is coming I put beat on you rap dudes
I don't wait on you rap dudes
Nigga NASA couldn't reach my altitude
Sky's the limit, and your body ain't airborne...
Is it? Are you?
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My real niggas, once again it's on
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told you Rock, I like red too
But you gotta kill these niggas out the blue
They don't see it coming
Who ain't a part of the family tree
Do 'em like Paul Bunyan, axe about him
We travel like an ant colony, you can't count us
Sip Henny 'til my throat drown
New Benz, No Malice
Count money 'til our hands get calloused
40 caliber in the Cavalier, welcome to Los
Angeles, you might leave with bandages
Real life, no mannequin
You pull out, no panicking, you better shoot
Or have something fall on your rooftop, no raindrops
I'm talking 'bout gold bullets and black suits
No magician, no magic, POOF
Closed casket fatal attraction
Son 3 hit you like John Paxson, I ain't bullshitting
Them veterans been loved 'em
Talk about bars I got a life sentence of 'em
And I'm just like spitting cousin, ciao
No man get the best of him
[Verse 3: Punch]
The way I see, why rap?
I'm just wasting my breath
Y'all don't hear me
I'm just chasing my death
It's all over, the end's here so I'm pacing my steps
Try not to recollect what I know
These pregnant quotes meaning, they give life like semen
Be the reason my heart's bleeding
I'm coughing up blood in my palms as I recite the book of Psalms
Over a slow clap and kick drum, wis-dom
The application of your knowledge is me
Pay your tuition, this verse is like a college degree
Y'all don't hear me, y'all fear me like a doomsday prophet
When I'm focused, nothing under the moon can stop it
I leave you off the Earth's surface, that's what you get
For trying to test my patience like nurses
This ain't a verse this is a Kennedy curse
Put your brain on your lady's purses, you niggas crazy

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My real niggas, once again it's on
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running
My real niggas, once again it's on
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Hey, welcome to DA nigga
I really thought I was a drummer for a second there

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Follow me home, see where I was rose
Like the one in 2Pac's song that grew from the concrete
Half a line in Del Amo on cross streets
Baby baby mommas strappin' babies in carseats
Niggas failed art class, still they'll draw heat
Design a murder scene faster than an architect with a masters
One out of three niggas you know slang, that's a accurate fraction
Sunday dinner denim for packin' a mac in
Cheese in the pockets of potential rocket scientists gone bad
Like good girls movin' too rapid
Had it not been for the social status we after, our
Minds could've been on more than after hours
Some of us become legends, some are labeled as cowards
Others fall in between, I say I'm a king
Now you can disagree or kiss the ring
Either way nigga's kneel to my feet, don't be late
And if you make it in time to hear the trumpets, I
Know you gon' love it cause I love it
What's that?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Who wanna go 15 in a Del Amo park alley
Used to battle with the pep rally
Rest in peace Prospect, I miss you like a missile
I can vision you blowing up
I launch it in your memory soldier
Ask capital Z about snap capital G
How we used to wear triple A's and Footlocker T's
Two toned fitteds from swap meet
Prepaid Nokias would light up antennas at the AMC movie theater
Back when the bitches wouldn't holler
I was short 75 cent, he threw me a dollar
Can't forget J Silk, my ace boon coon
On me JT would've been proud of you
We used to mob to McDonalds every day after school
Or Shakey's for pizza if our allowance would allow it
I was wildin' saggin' with the crips I had no business
I learned, job or no job your ass better be with the business
I became an alchemist over instrumentals
I'm Jim Dear over here, that's the mayor say your prayers
It's C-A-R-son, daughter, father, mother's own
Turn my shakin' haters off and I'm right at home
And if you at home with me and hear the trumpets
I know you gon' love it, cause I love it
What's that?
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
How you like your stay so far?
Is it all it's cracked up to be?

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
If you ever caught the Carson Circuit
Ditchin' fifth period to hit the mall, then I hope you hearin' this
I do this for y'all, cause y'all can relate to me, you're my family
If you went to Cheapwood, Frog Acres, or Banana Lee
And still hit the ARCO on Del Amo and Central for gasoline
Chances are we know each other well
Not the one for wishes or for fishes, more like good
If you touched every Carson corner I once stood, then would you
Just open your ears and hear the trumpets, I know you gon' love it
Cause I love it

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Really feel like, really feel like I'm the king of Carson right now man
For real, nothing y'all niggas could tell me[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Just wave ya hands like this
Make some noise
Now scream!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Nobody come after
Nobody compete, y'all weak
This is more than us, an athlete
This is rhymes on stage, this is a rage
This not a party, this is a parade
I pass it to my homeboy Chance
Give it to em with ya homeboy man

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Damn, I'm on the stage with Earth, Wind & Fire
Gotta spit fire, rapper for hire
Hangin' out with Kendrick Lamar, Chicago
Like y'all go to my shows, I feel like [?]
I be rappin' off the top, I know I'm a star
How I end at Bonnaroo, we ain't goin' too far
I got a Super Jam to bond with me, it feel like Chicago
This the place you wanna end up, Bonnaroo make some noise!

[Break: Kendrick Lamar (Chance the Rapper)]
Hey! Hey!
(Make music, hey!)
(Save music, hey!)
[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Chance the Rapper, [?] turnt
'Fore I pass the rock when I rock with Surf
I'm feelin' like I could use a shirt
But if I got a couple words I could use a verb
Livin' in a big pen, it's big Chance
With my big pants, we rock Pimp A Butterfly
When I'm ridin' through I feel like I could [?]
I can never, never die, rappin' with my circle [?]
Feelin' like a samurai off the top of the tippy
I'm feelin' like I'm a hippy, I used to be super trippy
Now I'm feelin' music [?]
I be hangin' with my homie, that's how music go!

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
And that's the music flow
And if you with me right now, homie now ya know
I said we talkin' bout Surf, talkin' bout K Dot
Knowin' we rule the Earth, talkin' about hip-hop
Talkin' this non-stop, talkin' that real rock
Talkin' right from Chicago, L.A. the top
Make some mothafuckin' noise in this bitch
Cause you know I don't stop, this is great as it get!

It's a Polarbear beat, suckas

[Verse 1: Big Steele]
I've been there, with my product of property
Visualize where it started, in that raggedy apartment, seein'
Unit six ...
Cover the concrete, grass only grow in patches
One out of every five mothers had a crack habit
Three out of every five pops just up and vanished
Creating bastards who turn misfortune to magic
And morph pain into hip-hop classics
We the, ghetto messiah, spread our gospel through the bootleggers
Prosperity preaching the words reach foreign nations
I thank god for ... and Flash
And visionaries like Eric Wright and Dame Dash
Uncle Luke, J Prince and Russell
The players that turned dreams into million dollar hustles
Know that, without hip hop in my life I would probably be
On level 4 in the walls of the penitentiary

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I still remember the first time
That I ever turned my boombox on
I just lay back and unwind
Whenever I turn my boombox on

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
Now who's that Puerto Rican (something something)
Lyrically so committed I should be
Literally committed to a mental institution
Chasing satanic illusions, survived my step-fathers abuses
My music loosen nooses
It's proven I'm ruthless, this dude is so ready to rumble
Ain't playin' with a full deck so please don't get caught in my shuffle
As a child living in the hovel I'd mug you
To get a name ...
Got 'em like I'm Saddam Hussein's insane uncle
... no muzzle so erratic
Beef better keep it hidden like Schwarzennegar's coke habit
Spilling my pain, psychological dark thoughts
Animal niggas should be walking on all fours
I spit it high, with the skill of a thief picking a lock
And a Benz full of bullshit like my MySpace inbox
My pen is a menace, I control the world in one sentence
West Coast stand up, Chino, Big Steele and Kendrick
Started drinking Saint Ides when I was knee-high
Still never look over the hill like Denzel in Book of Eli
Before 16 and Rick Rubin signed me
I turn on my boombox and imagine I was Cool J
God is good

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I still remember the first time
That I ever turned my boombox on
I just lay back and unwind
Whenever I turn my boombox on

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to my world
Back when Martin was the shit
And rocking ...
... bottles of Saint Ides
...
K was like nah, a young buck
Tryna find his outlet, coulda been an outlaw
Lil Wayne wasn't out yet, inspried by DMX
Inspired my first rhyme, glad to find a .49
I hadn't struck a gold mine
Ya'll done fucked up
My lyrics like BUCK BUCK
Then reload, then BUCK BUCK
Until he get FUCKED UP
Porno, lights, cameras, action
I'm about to get it cracking like the ceiling in your grandma's attic
Bitch I'm at it all night long
Hong Kong ... King Kong
And that means I'm quick to stampede
On each and every song I be
Kendrick, expensive, lyrics out the ass
You smell what I'm kicking, boomboxes I get wicked
Pull up...

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I still remember the first time
That I ever turned my boombox on
I just lay back and unwind
Whenever I turn my boombox on

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
When times is crazy
I look at the stereo and it say, "Play me!"
That's when I get [?]
Ohh, that's when I get [?]
You see, this is my story my pain
My struggle and fight
And when I wanna get away from life
I put my boombox on
Ohh, I put my boombox on
Ohh, ohh oh



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the rulers apologize, you ain't ruling shit
I'm Rick Rubin in '85 with the beard thick
Thick bitch type peruvian slanted eyes that squinch
I tell you that I'm one up
Sun down, or sun up
Son, I son niggas
I probably fucked your mama
With no condom
That's good pussy, pussy
Tell it to your honor
This trauma is Jeffery Dahmer
It took me too many moons to fuck up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kick pushed with push brooms
Man look, your man look like sweet water
Cornbread that break under pressure when he's caught up
They call me said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a young boss in the batcave
Back against the wall
I came back with them back pains

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell 'em put my name on a gym ball
Like I'm Derrick Rose
Ho, know my gym
And players not allowed
I'm spiking your game towel
And spiking your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go and punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not a basket, but rather this good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas
I make your weight shape thin
Blank tapes in your deck
You can still break they necks
They hear it, you need clearance from the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to spend
Club appearance go for twenty-five racks
When you getting it like that, shit, it gotta be a sin
So Lord forgive me yes I'm a sinner
But these hoes is with me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner
I coached fools to protools to make my agenda
I'm tofu, Im nasty like tofu
I wish a motherfucker would
Get your whole career injured
Nigga, that's assault with a deadly weapon
I killed your favorite rapper
Favorite rapper last record
I fucked your favorite actress on the matress
What a blessing
Make that pussy ante up
She call my dick antidepressant
I'm really not impressed with
None of you niggas stressing
That some of you niggas blessed with
The gift to carry the presence
Picking popping
I'm popping big shit with label investments
Fifteen minutes go for fifty seconds
Last night, I spent twelve hours inside a session
Came up with shit, writer's block
Niggas up in this dressing like
"Who the fuck cares? Who the fuck cares?"
Even when you Slumdog, you'll still be a millionaire
Nigga playing Santa Claus will make sure you hold deer
Have him first put that bitch in a hearse while Rock steer
Church to you pussies
You push me, get pap smeered
Burst out your cookie
I read it, my fortune is here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Look, this be that shit that make real niggas grab they dicks
And bitches rubbing on they tits
Until they fingers monkey wrenched
Monkey see what monkey do
You monkeys never make no sense
Jump up a tree, shit on you
Shitting bricks that can build a castle
No hastle when breaking your picket fence
Know pterodactyls that still exist
And clap you if you resist
Cooperate, go home and seen they daughters copulate
And you at risk
You wear a bracelet, we want your wrist
You can taste it from planet Pluto
Doggone it, you panic just like a poodle
Rip out your culo, then kudos
Two Door regal, El Caminos, and two more
Cause I [???]
Wipe it off on my shoe, ho
Before you [???] your Menthol
Meant to get smoked then sent off
To Jamaica
No trace of a Laker with Toni Kukoc
Means ain't no hood
Hopping California JACO
Watching Snoop's latest prince get down
Bitch, start popping fireworks
K. Dot

[Verse 1: G-Mack]
Lucked up once
Lucked up twice with two women with potential of the wife like tight
One was not that bright
So I leaned on the other for the lectures
Her convos were the best because she thought like a professor
From college but the problem is she wasn't really gudda
Like the chick I new before her didn't dub my baby mother
I lived a double life which had its thrills in the beginning
Till I felt the wrath of [?] with the feelings of these women
But dealing with these women kept my ego to the ceiling
Cause the homies called me player everytime we all were chilling
I knew it wasn't right telling em things with similarities
Feeding em dreams with different wedding rings if they should marry me
But every player knows its kinda hard to get involved
When your dealing with emotions in the presence of a broad
So imma take the time to give the ladies an applause
Especially if you stay strong even with a broken heart

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when you're around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin'
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart
[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
You been down with me since I first started
No love for a friend, baby girl cold-hearted
I know it's really hard to believe
But fuck her with the shoe, I probably would never succeed
On my knees, beggin', 'Please' for the Lord to forgive me
I tried to bounce, but your spirit had bit me
I'm drinkin' the Remy, killin' niggas, squeezin' the semi
Ridin' 'round in a Cutlass, shit, I need me a Bentley
I missed bail cause of you, nigga, went to jail cause of you
Trialed niggas in my cell cause of you
I squeeze shells cause of you, I wouldn't tell cause of you
Even probably brought my ticket down to hell cause of you
Damn, look, see, I'm knowin' that I'm 'posed to shake
But anytime I leave you, I'm feelin' my heart ache
Hope you feelin' my vibe, holmes
Nah, not a chick, I mean the shit that you drive, holmes

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when you're around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin'
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Livin' a double life, havin' double shots of Patrón
With my mistress 'stead of my wife, I was on
Like the switch in my Marriott, can we get married, Dot?'
I fucked her three times, then I was gone, apparently not
Story of the 80–20 rule is me
Movin' cautiously, parked in the park with my back seat
Way back, her perfume on my white tee
Ignorin' calls from my wifey
See, I was dead wrong, but was tryin' to get a nut
And she had some great dome
Like the New Orleans Saints when they're playin' at home
What's a nigga to think? Oh, just throw away some pussy
Then my conscious called me, 'Pussy'
You don't understand, mama had ass
And I'm quite a butt man, I love my wife, but, man...
I never thought of the day I would quit
Till I opened the door, seen a nigga fuckin' my bitch

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when you're around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin'
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
If you was in a pine box (Box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in an-and fall asleep (I fall asleep)
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me ('Cause you are)
If you was in a pine box (Box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep (I fall asleep)
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me
'Cause you are, the-the death of me, you-you, the death of me

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar, women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all
'Cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as… myself
And it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you're outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died*Lyrics from Snippets*

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
...always right
And love your mother, she's the reason why we're both alive

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
That's right, my little butterfly, butterfly, you got a long way to go
Darling, just take it slow

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
...wonder if there's only a frame
It's what's inside, that heart following love in those veins
I still see Johnny...
My little brotha, we evolve, we evolve like

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Butterfly, butterfly, you got a long way to go
Darling, just take it slow

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Bought a Benz for my baddest bitch
—and let my niggas drive that motherfucker
I swear that court room can minimize a mothafucka
Pray for us cause we be in and out that mothafucka
Lord, help us Lord, my bitch is beautiful, Helen of Troy
Just like assume I get ass from the start
I flip the script when they cast for the part
You ain’t talking to me if you ain’t talking money my nigga
Strength in numbers, my nigga
And I'm number one like my muscles got bigger
Like my puzzles got figured
I spoil my kids, they so stubborn, my nigga
This is how shit is supposed to be though
Rollie on my wrist and around my neck
I got a chain of command and a food chain on
Shoutout my dog lookin' at the four walls
Shoutout Candace for acceptin' my calls
Impossible ain't impossible at all
Tunechi

Nigga do that shit, nigga done that shit
Nigga any problem, bet I overcome that shit
Twenty gold bottles I'ma drink on that shit
Twenty songs that I'm on, number one that shit
My name gon' ring and my team gon' win
I shot a nigga once, and I'd do that shit again
Put your hands on a Bible stealing candy at a store
To a black homicidal it's the same damn sin
Drop down, give me three points ho
K. Dot, give it to it how you want ho
I'ma show you what this West side about
I'ma pull up in a 'Rari at your grandmama's house, hey now
She got a nigga name in her mouth, hey now
T-O to N-O to ammo, I mean
My MO is zero, see commas, I promise
Go tell your mama this dick ain't for free
This dick ain't, this dick ain't
This dick ain't, this dick ain't
This dick ain't for free
Touch that, I need cash back, transaction
I bust back in a all black Grand National
Hoodrats in the project if you ask 'em
They wanna buy the world, 10 racks on they taxes
Holiday cheers, Sallie Mae checks
With a bottle to the neck, get it how you live it

[Hook: Future & Lil Wayne]
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Kids]
I say hol up (hey!)
I just wanna ball like them grown ups (hey!)
Tell em catch me if they can

You know just what my mind's on these days
Keep singin' with me

From California
Born in Seminole Hospital nigga
November 29, 1979
On some G shit
My moms ain't scream or nothing
And I ain't never cried nigga

[Verse 1: The Game]
Motherfucker I'm from Compton, the hub city
I brought some thugs with me
That'll set up shop and get rid of drugs quickly
Drive Cutlass Supremes, on gold D's, puff sticky
Love 2Pac to death and still bump Biggie
Welcome to the west side
Where them Tec's fly
Dope boys drive them S5's
Come smoke and get the best high
Who the fuck said the west died
You dead, this the left side
I will Heckler & Koch, pop shots, for my [Cali Niggas]
Deal niggas, then smoking aces fucking with my [Cali Niggas]
Leave them with poker faces
Red rag, pull it down so they know it's Jayceon
Riding down Wilshire
07 Charger, K&M Filter
High speed burning it up for my [Cali Niggas]
My life real like it was directed by Hype Williams
I started off with visions of stacking Benjamins to the ceiling
The more gang banging, the more killing
The more drug dealing
The more cap peeling
We all [Cali Niggas]
[Verse 2: Ya Boy]
Ay, From Frisco
Never rode a 6-4
They might ghost ride, ghost ride
But Ya Boy is low pro
Stay on the low though
Black Tims, Lacross polo
Black peekhole
Long nose 4-4
Ya never got your hands dirty
I'm outside with the grams early
Puffing life by the gram heard me
High as a bird
Grinding the curb
And if I get caught put me in a cell with my [Cali Niggas]
On the block, busting shots with my Cali Niggas
Fucking with them boys up in Watts, we all [Cali Niggas]
We run deep, hit Compton and rally niggas
Hurricane Game, line them up, let me tally niggas
Trouble makers
Call them big guns, rumble makers
Let the thunderquake 'em introduce them to the undertaker
Palm trees
Big sun with the calm breeze
You can call me one of the re, realest [Cali Niggas]
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yes, Southern Cali
Home of the Chuck Taylors, not Bally's
Far from Vegas, but Sin City
Ab-Soul, put me on it, chronic in the air
Catch the vapors
House parties, hungover through morning, see thats a [Cali Nigga]
You see I'm from the murderous blocks
Compton, California where you'd rather get caught with your gun on you
See it's as hot as a sauna
And in the winter time, niggas don't walk out without kissing they momma
Life of a [Cali Nigga]
Hip-hop trying to take the life of us [Cali Niggas]
Don't call them rappers, address them as Bill O'Reilly niggas
But we gon get them and we kill em, address them as some Hally niggas
Never the more they say they ain't feeling these [Cali Niggas]
When ya'll was ditching class over these hoes man
I was at Centennial catching fades over dice games
That's one years ago, 350 days
350 ways, I switch the flow, a hot [Cali Nigga]
I am a good dude to work with
Destroy your life or destroy these rap verses
Life's a bitch
So I buy whatever she wants, and hope heaven can be my reimbursement
Milk the game until I see her on the couch roaming this earth surface
At first I was parched, but now I'm the thirstiest
Dehydrated
Hungry, frustrated
One of the greatest [Cali Niggas]
[Verse 4: Dubb]
Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey
I'm on the Wall Street like a stock broker
Then I'm back to the hood where they pop toasters
Every nigga screaming war, they is not soldiers
Selling crack in the hood with my [Cali Niggas]
Look, I'm shitting on everything moving
This on my chain ain't a label it's a movement
Fuck with caps, it's a nail in the coffin
Look, I shoot arms like heroin addicts
Look, a hater shit get drastic
You my son, they kill me, you end up a bastard. ha
I got the internet going nuts
Bitches hitting me on myspace say they want to suck him up
You want beef? What the fuck is up?
If so when we meet, I got heat for these [Cali Niggas]
When I spit, the realest will feel something
That's why I stay on the block, I'm still hustling
When you shit on the drop my shit pumping
A spot like a mailbox, it's where the bills come in
Me and Hurricane riding in an S5
Snatch a nigga up, take him for a test drive
Tie the nigga up, show him how the west ride
South Central LA, I'm a [Cali Nigga]
Where the best was born
Make sure your vest is worn
Cause nigga's will split ya chest when the Tec is drawn
Nigga's will split ya deck, then pull your card
Just try to act hard on the boulevard
You know it's me in the coupe when I'm speeding through
The fiend's say I whip colt like a vehicle
It's three birds, a bitch, brick, and four fifth
With them three, I take over the whole strip
No shit
The skinny nigga is no bitch
Know this, I'm so loyal to my [Cali Niggas]

[Verse 5: Jay-Rock]
Crusing through my hood to see whats good
My block considered Death Row but we ain't never signed to Suge
California, I got my heart in it
Disrespect, get ya shot, like I'm bartending
Me and Game we blood brothers with different pops
He the seed of Compton, I'm from Harlem, Watts
Hubbing a dub
Slugging a snub
Busting at any motherfucker who be fucking with us
This is Watts, California, gutterville, U.S.A.,
Gangbang capital, crackhouses, yellow tape
Riding through the city streets
Cannon right under my seat
Chopper in the back of the trunk, who want it with beef?
Seperate your soul from your flesh if you ever hate
Keep your comments to yourself, watch your soul levitate
South Central LA
Nigga it's the place to be
In my house, counting big money is the place for me
Blow good dro, and ride G rides
Gangbanging and cane slanging, the whole nine
Chuck Taylors, red strings, and khaki suits
Black & Milds, Chronic blunts, and Absolut
Killa Kali, fuck scrapping we clap you fool
Fuck the talk, bring your gat, we're blasting two's
From the block to the booth I'm the realest
Jay-Rock nigga and I do it for my [Cali Niggas]

[Verse 6: Topic]
Who the fuck want to snatch you from me?
And I don't chase bitches nigga I chase after money
Cannibal hungry
Trying to eat till my belly bust
I'm Cali raised, ghetto slang, you smelling us?
It's boss' life nigga
I put it down like I'm dropping the habit
Smoke an ounce and get up with more bounce than a rabbit
Got to have it like a crack fiend
Counting big face hundreds till my thumbs green
Interested in major money and power moves
Interfere and get em wet up like a shower do
That's how we do
Street sweep you when we ride up on ya
I represent that West Covina, California
Sixty-six hit more licks than a tootsie roll
Give me a mic, a bad bitch, and I'm good to go
Slow flow
Game cold like a eskimo
T.K.O. dawg
I think they better let it go
Lyrical arsenal
I heat it up, I like to flame a mic, {Topic loosen up}
I can't Game, my game to tight
I'm out of sight like Haley's Comet
Throw up my set, boss' life, like I'm sick and vomit
Bow down to the realest, nigga pay your homage
In the city of 600's and mostly Chronic, haha, West
And I'ma stay clutching, busting the trigger
Talk that shit, fuck around and get ride by us [Cali Niggas]

[Verse 7: Eastwood]
Ay, whose back in the 'Lac on white walls
Big body, the same color as Lysol
Hit the block up, if an enemy turn the lights off
And pull up on the fake ass nigga to turn his life off
Block out!, Block out!
Busting, watch the bike fall
I told em about them self-self made niggas, we ain't like y'all
We on some other ish
My goons will smother shit
From my Piru niggas down to them Eastside Crips
I thug like everyday's my last, ask Jesus
He never missed the beat of my heart, and won't neither
A true leader
In the Ferrari two-seater
Slide off to the spot, get bread, and kick my feet up
I'm knocking doors down
When I come around
Better have a nigga cheesey, everybody face down
I represent the city, the home of the Lakers
Inglewood, riding authentic we paper chasing, a Cali Nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Peep the style and the way the cops sweat us
Artillery got a gun for every letter
In the alphabet while your family in pajama's
I'll be stepping in your house like Alpha Beta Gamma
I’m creeping
Got a dorm something decent

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Fuck a fist fight the shells bubble
If its beef got the desert double
Still got the work in the duffle
Eat sleep, shit, breathe, Hustle
The game bang russell simmons
Gun tucked under the linen

[Verse 3: Kendrick]
V12 stock engine (yeah)
Don’t worry he’ll be dead in a minute
59 seconds past then I let them shots blast
And I do it quicker than a horny 8 grey class
And sit them in the water like Alcatraz
Don’t bother with the god mc

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Godfather, build big dro like Rasta, ya bumbaclot
You got chickens we raid ya spot
Kick in your door waving’ the 4 4
Let it blow like a Chicago snow storm
Even if its 20 below still bear arms

[Hook]
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants

We don’t stop, Ingle wood  we won’t stop
It’s compton in the house

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
K-Dot Jay rock nigga shit your drawers

Squeezed off on em paramedics tried CPR
And 3/4s of his heart the young boy coughed on em

[Verse 6: Jay Rock]
Who Shot ya ?
5th sing like Sinatra
These hollow tips we call em heart stoppers partner
Red and black impala ride street like patrollie’s
Coached by OG’s to stay low-key (what else)
Sip 40’s and stay with a 4 T

[Verse 7: Kendrick]
My pockets bo key
Middle fingers up to the compton police
I’m a threat to the law and your flow got too much baking soda pa
It’s pissing your fiends off they be like “now raw?”
I’m outta here K-Dot got that powder for years

[Verse 8: Jay Rock]
So focused we aim straight
4 shots will knock off 6 braids
Been doing this since sixth grade
You wack niggas need first aid
Got me twisted like dreads, I run money with two legs

[Hook]
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants

South Central we don’t stop, East LA we won’t stop
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants
(where we from) California let me see those hands
South Central we don’t stop, East LA we won’t stop

[Verse 9: Kendrick]
Its 08 let me tell you what they tryna do (what) clone humans
I’m so dope, they want me as two
What are you doing, respect you more if you called it a truce
But we burn white flags, so its probably no use
They tell me we hot, I’m looking like who?
Probably in heaven is the only time you couldn’t show me some proof
Until then keep stepping’ while I act a animal in the booth
You looking at the one man sitting zoo, Pity the fool thats denying the truth
I’m the word like bible study you heard class is over my toddlers

[Verse 10: Jay Rock]
Top Dawg Enterprise
You went for ? get sprayed like insectiscide
Count hundred dollar bills for exercise
No money printer, just paper splinters
Yeah you hating ass niggas cry a river

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Its so much drama in the bottom of Watts
Kinda hard bein' jay motherfuckin' rock
Gains cop from bitch niggas that wanna see me flop
It ain't happening captain wait till my album drop
More money, more hoes, of course more haters
When you see, they gon' hate you
I can't be faded, can't be seen
Yea the thangs a blow
Til your head, lord knows where your brains will go
Trigger finger itchy
Rollin' with killas that leave a 6 in your wig piece
Going against me that's blasphemy
I'm a blood, got crips that'll blast for me
Nigga you know my gang, its tighter than blood nigga
I got some because i'm hot like a slug nigga
Walk up in the club with the slug, chained a bitch
Flexed up then, them thangs will spit nigga
You better duck when I aim the shit
I can't be faded, I am the shit
Jay Rock
[Hook: DJ Dave]
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking street

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Went from flipping monkey on bars
Gang-banging, caine slanging now I'm chilling with stars
Grew apart, got the hood on my back
From L.A to the bay, West Coast we bringing it back
Make way, I got the base in the trunk of my car
Middle finger to laws
All I gotta say is fuck em all
I blaze a pound for them niggas behind bar
Free my nigga Poodamey
Homie just stand tall
My nigga two t's the bitch killer
I'm Jay motherfucking Rock you can call me the snitch killer
Them bitch niggas think they got big balls
Come test the board, get smoked like the menthol
I'm more 55 on tracks of heavy weight
I got gats that make your ass levitate
I got raps that'll make your ass stutter me
I got tapped how your bitch loving me
I can't be faded, that's why I'm the most hated
I'm the motherfucking hoes favorite
[Hook]
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking street

Its AKAD now yeah
AKAD now oh yeah (Tumany 7NiM$)
And U say Da M
Da M!
11:24 iNc baby...

Bitch you can't kill my vibe, cause I'm so damn live, so alive
It is light that I shine, it is bright in my mind, then I write them in rhymes, tighten every line, on the mic I will shine
And I know Nottingham will wish I was raised there
But in the Noosphere to me, it was made clear
Why my birth was the first of the year according to the new world calender
The birth of the new world challenger
My smirk ain't a compliment, nah its a challenge bro
Your work must be relevant, there's must be talent bro
Got my eyes on the game like d screen of a monitor
Good morning world
Guess you still wiping the cold off your eyes
I'm on the rise so don't fuck up my high
High above the sky you can't come up dis high
Never sold crack but i want a piece of the pie
And yeah I came to the world through the ports of England
Third hour of day three, I reached the cosmos region
A son of the dawn, the sun to the moon, Ousama Saddam
The Enemy you hate, the energy you take
From enmity you've made is eminently a waste wait (hold up)...

Now back to this joint
Back to putting them niggas on point
Like the dot of an i, or the tail of an y
Like Bob Marley, its some natural mystic, don't ask me why
Or I'mma just lie, base on a truth, but there is no truth, based on a lie
Boy am killing this bitch, she ain't killing my vibe
Yea I gotta kill this bitch before she kills my vibe
So bring out the missiles, the rockets, the launchers, and bombers
Suicidal monsters and lets fall Olympus like a movie
I know they gon' be like who's he
I'm more like a baby with two teeth
Will do anything for the game am 3T
They can't wait to televise me on 3D
I kick some conspiracy shit am Bruce Lee
Snoring on me then wake the fuck up
The slept-on ones are stepping the fuck up
I know you hear the twist in the beat
The cords of the Kora, the strings of Africa
The cores of the Torah, stems from Africa
Keep this shit on repeat
I ain't paid for the beat so I need no receipt
See my man MoudSound emailed me the beat
And these bitch ass dudes looks like female to me
Bilingual kid spitting from English to Twi
(laughs) chaley yenkor
(French)
Mais si "je le suis" 3x
Le maitre du franglias
Le qui t'empeche, D'etre un examplaire
Car je les enterrent
Un vol direct en enfer
Ils sont fais en bois,moi jsuis fai en fer
Bref, je tue tous les sons que j mets sur le net
Et les mecs ki croient que je suis un traite
Mais les meufs elles savent elles me doivent une baise
Et au traite,C'est le sila et on reste les maitres
Comme le Yakuza, si tu trahir on t'enleve la tete haha Ok

Conakry ouias je sais que vous entendez le bruit
L'arbre a grandi venez manage le fruit
L'ensemble est lepi et kente, mais la centures est LouisV
Ils ont voulu me chasser, maintenant ce sont eux qui fuient
A l'abri, je le suis
A la vie, je la vie
L'enemie, je l'elimine
Et la suite est a suivre...
Ahh!

And I been spitting dis way since 02
And I don't give a fuck if you don't know tum
Tum doesn't know you doesn't intend to
Send me a friend request I won't befriend you
Follow on twitter I wouldn't trend you
Like 2face as you see me so I no dey send you
Ahhh!

As you see me so I no dey send you its Da M!
As you see me so Bitch can't kill ma vibe it Da M!
As you see me so (ooo) Da M is the Motherland Da M

He's African Kid American Dreaming #AKAD 2x its Da M!

[Intro]
I wanna hit line drives…
Wanna lose weight and keep eating…
For you…
Hey, whats up doc?

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Gunplay]
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
Ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic (Y-Yeah!  Blow!)
Ironic (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic
[Interlude]
Liberation… Leader…
Popular pie plant pictured here…
Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say, "killa" then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air
And everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
Cartoons and (Cereal!) I ain't felt this (Good since!)
Scrooge McDuck (Here we go!), elementary hood shit
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everbody corner (Dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag
With a task of a new (Task force)
Everybody wanna know my life
How did I make it (Past yours)
Well let me tell you like this
I've been running this shit since I (Asked for)
Cartoons and cereal

Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth, just for you
Muhfucka, hope y'all amused!
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can't mute me
But I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah, this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain…

[Outro: Gunplay]
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain
(To be continued)[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Pulling up and hopping out
Shell, catch it poppin' out
And I ain't never been a Tom or a Jerry
Pussy or a Rat, pussy on my nutsack
Carry plenty Kenny tats, give me that, give me plenty fetti
Federales on my back, pack them in the cemetery
Send a scary hit out on your messenger
I'm ignorant to wrestle a gorilla in the center of an Acura Integra
I'm pissed off, so I piss off rooftops
Drinking through a straw, fuck a rent-a-cop
I'm hot, I'm napalm when the beat slap like eight palms
And I wear eight charms, every airport alarm
Go off till they tackle me, what I do wrong?
Nigga it ain't 'bout the chain, nigga you the fucking bomb
Bomb on a bitch nigga then his bitch later
Put the tips on the bitch, nigga you a fucking waiter
I don't even want a favor, I just want a fair one
And it's like that till the sheriffs come
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade

[Verse 2: Droop-E]
Droop-E, look
Problems we solve them, 'bout that action
One less sucker nigga, that's subtraction
His boss is, factors on the team
Real niggas, no actors on the team
Not you, who Droop? He a good dude
Put him in a bad mood, he turn you into goon food
I'm in the party, feeling like me
S-I-C-K with TDE
Your bitch want sex and my ear like wax
And this Landy got her ready to get it hit from the back
She shows up chump, salute give daps
Get your face flat, you don't want that
Get your nose tapped, you don't want that
Get your life fucked up all over a batch
Get cropped, get chopped on your head like a barber shop
Have it out in the parking lot
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade

[Verse 3: E-40]
Stay turned, super charged up, stoned
Ghetto pass never revoked
Mouthpiece faster than a speedboat
Keep it one hundred like a C-note, pea coat
Po-po tryna decode lingo
Not drunk but I'm finna be hella twisted
Lifted like a toilet seat, grown ass kid
My bitch always telling me, I ain't shit
She hate me, but she love my dick
Trapper factor macker having money like a rapper
Bumping local talent pulling up with the blabber
Patna wanna challenge 'cause my pockets hella fatter
But he gone be unlucky like walking under a ladder
Put hands on a man, fuck unity
Ain't nothing between us, but space and opportunity
Never been a sucker, never been a lame
Stay in your lane, you can't see me like a stealth plane
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade

[Outro]
Where you from Droop-E? (The West)
Where you from Kendrick? (The West)
Aye 40 where you from though? (The West)
Who bring it to their front door? (The West)
And where they get their game from? (The West)
And where they get their slang from? (The West)
And where they get their strains from? (The West)
And where they get their grapes from? (The West)

[Intro]
For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
Gimme that beat fool, this a full time jack
No really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it
When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag
And the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from living large
Matter fact where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one
I'm on one, I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart
From the blood niggas fucking with me, crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate
It's a legitimate reason why
I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch the Sky"
But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Y'all married to the game well I'm 'bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you going through something, this the shit you recite
This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour, I mean war like that!
Yeah, straight like that

[Chorus]
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

[Verse 2]
In 2010, I'm tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul
I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous
Searching seven continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies... homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga, my nigga Tony said
"Just do you, nigga!" Show and prove, nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure
'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!"
I ain't tripping I'm just tipping on fo-fo's
Back in the city and tipping on four hoes
That boy got a cold cold, he's sick con, slick on
Dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah, ooh
Straight like that

[Chorus]
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

[Verse 3]
Why y'all complain about OG's?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop, not Dre, not Ice Cube
I don't care me and Quik went to the same school
I look in the mirror and do it myself
Like a self made nigga, I don't need a maid, nigga
Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger
But do I need 'em though?, I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost
"Me Against The World" on you mothafuckas
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
Uhh, tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talking 'bout? I look at your Audemars
To put ya'll in time out, it's time to unveil the real
And your career is about as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute, grab a flute, and pull the wine out, ooh
Just like that

[Chorus]
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight
I'd like to share with you, my celebrity scenarios
I promise I won't tell baby girl
I can hold water, I promise

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got this girl named Meagan Good
Well, you could say that Meagan was bad
The way she talk dirty he done threw me the ass
Like a quarterback Mr. McNabb
She introduce me to her friend Teairra Mari
Well, see Mari put a nigga to sleep
She made her boy feel good even curled my feet
Now please don't go back to Jay-Z
It's a rap, I used to fuck with Christina a while back
Which one, Aguilera or Milian, both of em
They did this little trick with their tongue
I came faster than a NASCAR spinning backwards
Brandi like to suck it she said she needed some practice
In the back of my bucket wasn't using no mattress
Brooke Valentine like to take it from behind
Face down, ass up, shit I love it when she climb

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Psych
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And about Vivica
I had her way before 50 Cent start dissing her
One thing I know, shit I hope he wasn't kissing her
Man she could blow like a torch
And dick without using a fork
She introduced me to Gabrielle of course
Union, had her on my backyard porch
Legs up film rolling, action, cut
She looking at me like "what happened, get up"
[?] fucked up so Holly came
Shit I felt that I lucked up
Gave her my last name, Trina moved on
She fucking with Lil Wayne now
It's OK, I ain't crying about my hand-me-downs
I'ma sit back, take it for what it's worth
But for now I'm free, "can you please lift up your skirt?"
We can do lunch, later on be dessert
I'll give you a job, since 106 didn't work
Out

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Psych
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ciara gave a nigga the goodies love tonight
And Bow Wow wants to see my cars out the house
[?] nigga maybe wanted to fight
He seen the burner on the draw and walked right out
Will Smith knows exactly what I'm talkin' bout
I had the same altercations when dealing with Jada
Baby momma drama I start fucking Fantasia
Nothing serious, she thought of it as a favour
And Lindsay Lohan, made my shit stand up
Like a Voltron, I couldn't keep my pants up
The Pussycat Dolls want the fantasy of all
Like, I'ma need some help trying to fuck all of y'all
Hour later, that's when Amerie called
Saying "this just one thing"
OK ma, "you don't have to fiend for the ding-a-ling"
I'll be over there, make sure Eve over there
I wanna see y'all mingling together

[Bridge]
Remember that time at my house
Remember that time at your house
Remember that time on the bed
Remember that time on the couch
Remember that time on the chair
Remember when Nelly was downstairs
We all had a good time
Didn't we all have fun
As celebrities can we?
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know

[Chorus]
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, ho ho ho, ho ho ho
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, ho ho ho, ho ho ho

[Interlude]
I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils. There is an even more important topic I'd like to discuss: the dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era. Young men that learned to do everything spiteful. This is your generation. Live fast and die young. Who's willing to explain this story?

[Chorus]
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, ho ho ho, ho ho ho
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one...

Onun kötülükleri ve günahları hakkında konuşabildiğimiz için memnunum
Tartışmak istediğim daha önemli bir konu var
Ronald Reagan çağının işlevsiz piçleri
Her şeyi kindar bir şekilde yapmayı öğrenmiş genç adam
Bu senin nesilin
Hızlı yaşa ve genç öl
Kim bu hikayeyi açıklamak ister?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Babies from 80's don't know—know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance
But the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine
'member the universe used to be innocent
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Everyday that I wake up, I'mma sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80

[Outro]

New floors and the new crib for GOAT
No look when I'm dripped out for the toast
Legs up like cHop stix, like cHop stix
I sold out my front row to the back rows
Top down, ballin', hoes keep callin'
Maxed out paper, maxed out acres
Maxed out stroke, legs unfocused
Back-seat drivin', ass keep poppin'
Send them things, send the pictures

Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
Kendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well
We don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickridin'
I'm addicted to Westsidin'
Livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin', try-tryn', tryn'...[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar + Jidenna]
I'm the only nigga doin' it, you other niggas ruined it
I'm too legit, go Hammer wit' the foolishness
My nana said my grammar can maneuver this industry
Until I'm stupid rich and now I'm stupid rich, ah
(Even if she go away, even if she go away) A-woo-woo!
Assumin' this is what they humor is
To Pimp a Butterfly my newest shit
In fact the rumor is the way I proven it

[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man

[Verse 2: Jidenna]
I burn through the hood like, "Whoa"
When everybody's feeling so cold
I cool like Nat King Cole
And niggas get a bit of my glow
I got charm like a leprechaun, mummafunka
Now y'all fucking with the wrong mummafunka
Chief be like a don, mummafunka
And we don't live by the law, mummafunka
[Pre-Hook: Jidenna]
Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
(Classic man) That's on my mama though
I got piranha flow, fuckin' up your designer clothes
(Casket man) Where be your rapper's angle?
Bunch of subliminal bitches, I'd rather fingerbang 'em
Oh, ke-mo sah-bee, pray to God nobody try me
Catch a body over nothin, Top couldn't even stop me
I got key to my city, I got key to California
I might legalize your homicide and more marijuana
Let my daddy smoke his weed, only thing they keep me friendly
I ain't got no jewelry on me, bitch, I got the jewelry in me
Oh, shit, let me talk my shit, I always been the shit
This ain't overnight, they love me now like they loved me then
I know what I like, I eat the pussy for my nourishment
I know how to cherish it
I know how to decorate your wall and further furnish it
I'ma burn your shit down, this is what the furnace is
I'ma turn your shit around wit' some friendly services
Ain't no nervousness like I'm ratchet or conservative
And that's affirmative
All I do is lay-up and face up my big bills and pay stub
Got no chill for fake ones, like, for real, they say I'm...
[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man

[Verse 4: Jidenna]
Keep my gloves dirty but my hands clean
Got to keep the business in the family
Breadwinner filling up the pantry
Now my niggas slang cane like a dandy
I tell you how it go
You pull out rubber bands, I pull out an envelope
The ladies on my elbow ain't for the show
Every madam on my team is a top Jeneral, oh
Got to be ready for war (War)
Should they get into my door? (Door)
Get 'em, we'll get 'em, I know that we'll get 'em
Cause I lived through this shit before, oh

[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man

Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man
[Outro]
(I'm a classic man) Even if she go away, even if she go away
(I'm a classic man) Even if she go away, even if she go away
I'm a classic man, old-fashioned man

[Intro/Hook]
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
Fell into lust, where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as she want to be, hands all on my garments
And luckily, being in denial ain't the case
Cause I know she's unfaithful
Instead I'm grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful
I know you're feelings hating
In fact, you think I'm ungrateful.. I know
Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow

[Hook]
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me

[Verse 2]
Cause I been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
I'm going like a thief inside the wind
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know she want me more, but I fiend for benjamins
She said I found the root of all evil
And lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
That never knew love because love was never promised
I know.. selfish as I wanna be
And every time I'm under you, me too
Need time to grow..

[Hook]
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me

Motherfucker this is Watts, California
Gangbang murder state

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
(What's up, Jay Rock?) Shit, just the same old same old
Same fiends in the hood, chasing the best dope
Project hustling, chasing them pesos
It's a struggle everyday, man, you know how this shit goes
But my demeanor'll never switch, cherry red beamer
Gangbanged the fuck out, red rag around the nina
No doubt, I'm living it
Been claiming the set since the year found Snoop innocent
Slanging hard rock when the rap game was ran by Timberlands
The cortez is back, where's my strap?
Lemme put a hole in 'em, and what's concealed in the black denim
Will rock 'em to sleep like I babysit 'em
I seen it all - loyalty, betrayal, envy
My close homie died in my arms
12 hundred project units under the sun
Ain't about where you at, it's about where you're from

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
You ain't prepared when it go down
You already dead right about now
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
If you're prepared when it go down
Then you know it's Jay Rock turn now

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
The homie told me, "Put your feelings aside"
But since I got signed I been feeling the Vibes
Niggas play the background and screw they face all day
Wanna walk in my shoes, wanna take my place
So at any given time they might take my life
So I take the .38 when I ride at night
Broad day, no exempt, niggas kill you when the sun is out
Make sure your gun is out or stay inside your mama house
It's that real, you don't feel me yet?
Fine, niggas, drop the beat and just let me vent
No mask on, fuck around and kill your whole squad
Be the last person you see before you meet God
Keep the rifle on top of the tripod
Aim art, if you live your body might need parts
Jay Rock, putting it down for Top Dawg
From the bottom to the top, we shooting straight to the stars

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
You ain't prepared when it go down
You already dead right about now
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
If you're prepared when it go down
Then you know it's Jay Rock turn now

[Chorus (Partial): Rell]
Gotta trust your aim 'cause ain't no trust
All my gangstas understand

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fuckin' up the premises, I been a dick
Ain't beneficial, I'm 'bout to issue your nemesis
Evacuate the buildin' when I come through
Evaluate your feelin's when I come through
Tire marks and gun smoke stories
OGs reminisce and show glory
He said, "Nigga, I'm hopin' you make a way out
Before I make this Mac-11 do it for me"
I know responsibility weighin' down on my shoulders
Summertime always the coldest
Niggas do you dirty like the projects
25? Then you are the oldest
This is the feelin' you get when you ride
'Til the wheels fall off and there's no mo' drive
I see the fear when I look in your eyes
You should execute or x out and expire

[Chorus: Rell]
Another day (Yeah,) different time (Yeah)
But the same old story's told (Oh)
Even when it's warm outside
These streets can get so cold
Gotta love the game 'cause ain't no love (No)
And that ain't gon' never change
Gotta trust your aim 'cause ain't no trust
All my gangstas understand
[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Champagne liquor, pair of Bape slippers
Blue collar for the dollar, I'm in Pittsburgh
Young vet with rings, bitch, I'm Derek Fisher
Ballin' super hard, you can smell the swishers
No one I met workin' hard as I do (I do)
It's like I never even made a fucking dollar
I'm a genius though, you can check my IQ (IQ)
Y'all lookin' stupid when you pop your fucking collar
Take a breath (Take a breath,) make a toast (Make a toast)
I seen the Devil tryna take my soul
But he ain't gon' touch what he can't control
This some food for thought, you can get a plate to go
Me and Kendrick on a track, man, that's bad news
For all you rappers who be talkin' shit to act a fool (Act a fool)
Givin' bitches a "D" like we was back at school
But that's only if they got that bad attitude

[Chorus: Rell]
Another day (Yeah,) different time (Yeah)
But the same old story's told (Oh)
Even when it's warm outside
These streets can get so cold
Gotta love the game 'cause ain't no love (No)
And that ain't gon' never change
Gotta trust your aim 'cause ain't no trust
All my gangstas understand
[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Kept it street with you has beens, they just entertainers
Yet they're going dumb, they go to buggin' you for favors
Talk behind your back by telling women that they made ya
Scared of the slum, I be in 'em like broken bottles
Go to whippin' throttle, bending corners in the bottom
Did it like he's TIP, pull a *click*, then recline 'em
Cold summer, swimmin' in the puddle with piranhas
GRR like Eminem, bitch, I ain't never knew my momma
Changed on the first born, father wasn't shit
Sayin' every time she gaze at me all she see is this
A nigga on his dick scared to help with the rent (Why?)
Said she love me, I don't ever get the nerve to tell her shit
Cryin' on the inside, lookin' through the fence
Looking up to ballers, often time I reminisce
Prayin' to the stars, I go hard with the bricks
Flip 'em one to two, pass 'em the rock, make an assist (score)
Feel like MoneyMakingMitch, pure shooter, I don't miss
Kill 'em 'bout whatever, bet not ever get it bent
Bitch, you say you love to suck another nigga dick
Kept it real, get the money, ain't no sense in actin' funny, did a bid
Came home then made her fuck him in front me
Back to back, cold-heart makin' all assumptions
Now we goin' far but you came back from travelin' outta states
While you other bitches​ hate back in the country
Record deals saw why I had to fuck with who love me
And this WCW, love to cheat on her husband
She from Colorado, she'd die for niggas who thuggin'
While her faker was in prison, two niggas stuffed in the cutty
Ball players runnin' trains on her and her buddies
Picture get depicted you hated me over nothin', motherfucker
[Chorus (Extended): Rell]
Trust your aim 'cause ain't no trust
All my gangstas understand
Another day (Yeah,) different time (Yeah)
But the same old story's told (Oh)
Even when it's warm outside
These streets can get so cold
Gotta love the game 'cause ain't no love (No)
And that ain't gon' never change
Gotta trust your aim 'cause ain't no trust

Smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver
Watch this, no tick, yeah I'm the nigga
Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver

Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiendin'
Give me, give me, give me some
Freak the freckles off your face
Frenchy, freakin', swappin' tongue
Click my link and spread your buns
Lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it, baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Fuckin' in the car service, thank me for the car pool
Chromosome, part full, probly off a Norco
And gas, not the Arco, poppin' since the intro
You shoppin' from the window, play my favorite tempo
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury

Hold up, biatch! This yo' favorite song
Translation: Ven aqui, mami, ese culo
Tu quieres coger mis huevos, y papi me molestes
Pero chuparse puto pendejo, el pinche cabron
Let's get it – nights like this, I'm a knight like this
Sword in my hand, I fight like this
And I'm more than a man, I'm a god
Bitch, touché, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop
Out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo-doo, doo-doo," bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this
I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, on forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down
Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching, could buy anything, cop that

Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Bummy nigga famous, straight from the bottom
Broke niggas hate it, still never robbed him
Guns in the basement, out they have a problem
Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana
Function on fire, burn the roof off this mothafucka
Psych ward is ballin', go craze like no other
Weed steady blowin', pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'
Faded, faded, faded, right?
Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no, it's not the Westside
Stick it up your SoutHside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year
I spend that on my daughter shoes
Smokin' weed and drinkin', all the college students lovin' Q
We gon' turn it out until the neighbors wanna party too

Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit[Produced by THC]

[Intro]
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Verse 1]
Momma take this mothafuckin' block off
Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yeah, every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K. Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just get back at me this last time
[Chorus]
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Verse 2]
Mama, take this mothafuckin' block off
That's on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
'Member when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them goddamn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time
[Chorus]
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Verse 3]
Dante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Who is your protection? G-O-D
No, it's not neglection, I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon' be
'Member all the nights that I cried
Thinkin' that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kickin' through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this
[Chorus]
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Ok now shorty had yellow
Shorty eyes brown
Shorty so gold
And so is my crown
Baby color me red
Shorty code red
And so is my flag
Purple in my bag
And shorty hair black
And so is that card
That I got in my bag
How could I go Hard from my girl in fact
I could take a ball from the world
Since the president black
I went and bought a black pearls
Like damn
And she gonna wanna see lil wayne go
She just wanna bonnafie lil wayne boe
Now or later cause me and her gonna create art together
Ohhhh
She wanna do it has we do it all night
I never blew it hurt my lung
I only look nice
See the wall black and I dress all white
Yeaaa
[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar]
Mama says she love it when I'm color coordinated
So I pull up in a maroon coupe with maroon laces
In my Supras I maneuver like
MacGyver when it's time to ride
Say she always feeling blue
When he telling white lies
Rain on her window pain
All she see is grey skies
Told her hit this purple
Maybe this will ease your mind
I'm rocking purple lable
Check out my shirt design
Perfect with her purple kisses
Slack track number eight
From The Dream maybe this is something you ain't neva see
Put you in a real world
Take you out that green screen
Sippin on pink panties
In the stretched limousine
They takin off pink panties
When we hit the room please
Don't confuse me for no murderer like Norman Bates
But I'm about to kill it
Pull out the yellow tape
I'm guessing I'm a criminal
You caught up in my web
Like a brown recluse
K. Dot is a color never seen boo
[Verse 3 - Jay Rock]
She love it when I'm flamed up
Valet park the Red Lamborghini at the Grand Lux
Grammys with the red tux
She a red bone
Red manicure
Red hair
Think I like her
Might wife her in some red airs
Walk her up my red stairs
Headed to the red room
She gone yell code red once I jump in that womb
Red diamonds on my wrist, red diamonds on my neck
Give yo' ass a blood bath, if you ever disrespect
Red lobster, you a small fish walking thru my set
Red beam, I'm aiming from the roof of my projects
She know that I'm gangster, she read that I'm a prospect
Eatin' red beans, shittin' on em, "Where the flys at?"
Red in my pupils and that's just from the contact
She wanna blow up I'm a show her where that bomb at
So baby ride with the red flow
Her face turned red soon as I said let's go

[Outro - Lil Wayne]
Yea Ohhh
Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhhh Yeahhhhh
Ohhhhhhh Ohhhh Ehhhhhh
Hahaha That's right baby
I'm gone

[Intro]
Shout to my nigga Shellcase for doin' this beat for me too
That nigga look like a praying mantis

[Verse 1]
Drunk off a hard liquor, pourin' bottles over bitches
Pourin' hollows over haters, killin' insecure niggas
Feelin' like the old Jigga, old Nas
Old BIG, new Pac, oh my God, he's alive, he drop
Bombs on your intellect
Bombin' everything from the streets to the internet
Get the instrumental wet
Then I'ma buss a nut, yep, I'm a my fuckin' nut
That is not an Escalade, that's a damn armor truck
Shoot who? Shot what?
You ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
Who you motherfuckers want?
Leave a motherfucker slumped from the fuckin' pump
He's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in the trunk
Might be held in Houston, lean in my pimp cup
Ridin' 84's, throw it like a shot put
Hoes on my jock like I'm from the ATL
And I know black choppers on the rooftop
Flip a nigga like he was a NBA mascot
Strip a nigga from his wave cap to his tube socks
Got it from my grandpops, raised on them Compton blocks
Every day caught a fade like we on the barbershop
Goons in the parkin' lot
Ooh, you's a fool if you bark a lot with no bite
Like an iguana, get killed right in front of your momma
Hold tight, coroner coming
Summertime, perfect time for duck hunting
And your women wanna be in my house
With her ass out, she climax, then pass out
Like promotional flyers, K Dot be the flyest
Eat ten rappers a day, now that's a hell of a diet

[Chorus]
Your girlfriend, she all on me
Say she wanna clean my dirty laundry
Say she wanna clean my dirty laundry
Bitch, I'm K Dot and I'm keepin' it friendly

[Verse 2]
I got this jumpin' like a kangaroo, pumpin' like a fist do
From the pro black, this is automatic rap
Have a seat, grab a snack, we gon' be here for a second
Armageddon might be here, when I finish, pray that Heaven has a home
I'm alone in my own galaxy
You'll never have a head start with a dead battery
And they screamin' agony, when I write shit
My life is filled with excitin'
Visions of a nigga making mill's with a strikin'
Impact for ten years, I've been here before
See, this is all premature
I start the war like an instigator
Sharper than some cream gators
On a Thursday night, mix the Vodka with the Sprite
Better yet, roll the dice, watch me come up
He want to [?] with me, he cool, put your gun up



On Macklemore winning best rap album

It’s well deserved; he did what he did, man. He went out there and hustled and grinded. Everything happens for a reason; the universe comes back around, that’s how it go.


On the Grammys snubbing him entirely

I definitely feel like they should always have more of the culture up in there, for sure, because we definitely stand out just like any other genre. We part of the world. We part of the movement. So I think any awards, including the Grammys, should always push for more hip-hop because it’s music as a whole, it’s not just splitting different regions. Everything moves as far as sound and vibrations, and that’s how it goes. And we are a part of that.

[Intro: Pete Rock]
I'm with this

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Oh, Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, a feline color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Oh, Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

[Interlude: JaVonté & Kendrick Lamar]
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!)
[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey
I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self-esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, know colors ain’t a thing
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got

[Hook]
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it, my nigga?
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
[Hook]
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats

[Bridge]
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the Eastside
Know that's just how Compton roll

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in
[Hook]
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby

[Hook]
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of N.W.A
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"
[Outro]
Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Intro : Ab-Soul]
Yeah, see, I know I can make a lot of money doing this, man
It's just the whole process that uh...
That I'm having trouble with, you know what I mean?
I know you just, pretty much, you know
Get the water boiling, and just, uh, get a jar or something like that
Put it in the jar and just watch it you know bubble up and all that

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Shame on him! (what?)
Lemme put my gloves on
And my scrubs on
I'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen
This here is not for the children
You need parental advision
If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
First you bargain shop
Look for the priciest chickens
I recommend that you pay Jorge a visit
Got it wrapped in saran
17.5 no, drop four grand, this is LA man!
Unless it be a drought
But homie if it ain't, then it is somewhere else
Flip your hustle down south
That's a whole other story though
Back to the lesson, hope you're takin' down your footnotes, class is in session
Get your instruments
Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger you can stir it with
Split nine Os four ways in that 36
Place it on the triple beam
As hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky
Say you'll get it baby, just bear with me
Confidence before compliments
Now let's get busy
This is the procedure
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
Place it in the beaker
Your water should be boiling by then
Grab a small cup and pour it in
Twist the hanger until it's paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
But hold on it gets tricky again!
As your hand rotate
You're probably thinkin' it's safe
Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
Wait...you got it back soft (good)
Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
The work should rise to the top
Then pour some cold water on that
That's when the dope should drop
Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
Place it on the cardboard, then chop
As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
You're excited that the chemistry worked
This the fiend's appetite
This bigger than life
You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
You should thank me twice
Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
How ironic...hmm
Like most of you rappers
[Outro: Ab Soul]
Aw I don't believe that man
You're too professional with it man
There's no way you've never done it before, you know what I mean?
That was too descriptive[Intro]
Uh, oh, y'all know what it is
Uh, it's that Compton—ish

[Chorus]
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, (yeah)
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, (right)
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, (ad lib)
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, (let's go)

[Verse 1]
I'm back at it again
My city back at it with ‘em
Back against the wall, K Dot, they tryna pin
But they can fuck with that pen
The shit I write is brighter than blue gems, uh
You better stay in that gym
Exercise your mind till it's strong enough
To fuck with mine
Stick to my roots like Black Thought and 'em
I'm black with thoughts of Einstein
One word describing him, genius
What you know about the city I live in
With the souls of the dead is livin'
You don't know about our living conditions
We live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion
But it's more than just weed and women, gangsters, husslers
Bullet collisions, players , pimps
Who can envision the place where I reside
Where Eazy was pitchin', Dre was 6'4 lifting
NWA had mention, Quik had the turn tables mixin'
The first ones to say fuck the system
I'm tryin to tell you about
[Hook]
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life

[Verse 2]
Geah, his own street like concrete
Would best describe fit his gutter
But see I'm what's underneath
A young gun but not like your young Chris and Neef
I'm from the land of organized crime
Disorderly peace
‘Cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece
And worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs
The Compton shares can't forget the police
‘Cause in the hood tellin pigs no more
It be the mark of the beast
And their main aim is just the talk of the streets
But when you see ‘em please be quick on your feet
That they go , watch em!?
Had you for road kill just like a possum
You could contain ‘em
But there's no way that you can stop ‘em
Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
Hoping one day they blossom
The same time, hope the system don't lock ‘em
‘Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches we barely got ‘em
Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial
We back that's for my people it's official
[Hook]
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life

[Verse 3]
I don't know if he new around here
Ye it's good to know somebody if you're new around here
‘Cause it ain't too safe for you to cruise around here
Niggas stick to your ass like glue around here
Take New Jersey and fit it shit whatever you don't care
It ain't no magic trick if they make your shit disappear
The outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day
But I'm amazed cause the young boy been here for years
I seen niggas shed blood blood tears
Hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you
Had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters
Introduce you to rugers
Clock you in like Tap Judah
A nightmare on my street, Fred Krueger where I live
Minus the actress and the producers
Even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper
We get +Vapors+ like Biz Markie but still I'm used to
From Rose crest to central, Compton's Anthemia
We back that's for my people it's official

I’m a Nestor Ave  tibby rock thrower
Nightlife liver, still waiting to throw up
25 cents, Now & Later, and a soda
Snotty-nosed kids slap boxing on the corner
Yeah, that’s me right there
Sandy little Jordans and the swoosh in his hair
In the overall shorts, I ain’t have a care in the world
Contact, ‘cause my call right there
I thought I was Pac when ‘Hit ‘Em Up’ came out
Got in trouble for the music, I was playin’ it loud
Read the credits to all the CDs in the house
With the [?] bottle I was rockin’ the crowd
I was eight when I wrote my first rap line down
Shit, I remember, I was right on the couch
Are you feeling me? Back in third grade I was killing it
If y’all don’t get the metaphor, it’s all elementary
Summertime fun, mack daddy at the pool
Wintertime fun, selling candy at the school
Ready for the action, if it happened, I was cool
I ain’t see ‘em, if you do, tell my daddy I’m a fool, Kendrick

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick Lamar, plain old Kendrick the Average Joe
But not the average flow, just willing to make it, ock
That boy’s bacon, he got relations with Satan, Pops
This type of greatness is well-awaiting the fatal shots
Now what you know about them Westside streets?
We was five like deep, rapping the best of Mobb Deep
Rapping my best in my sleep, that’s if I ever slept
Countin’ bars while you countin’ sheep, you lookin’ at the best
God-given, I’m been spitting since Pokémon cards and yo-yos
Sauconies Girbaud jeans, when Wayne made “bling-bling” I was hip-hopping
Makin’ ‘em hop, have a pogo
Let’s get this cream, cold stones
I’m fallin’ off, hold on
When peeling off, BMX bikes
Ducking shots that was barking real DMX-like
A pizza and a cold Sprite
Peace to the world
I close my door and make love to the beat
Then fuck your girl
That was K.Dot then
[Verse 3: HOPE]
Top-tier, I’m here, they call me King Hope
With a mean flow dancing for the team, ock
Street hop from the bottom, we on the street’s top
It’s all scenic, believe it, you’ll get your bean popped

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I give you my album in replacement of Detox
I drop shit with ease to let y’all eavesdrop
On my style, eyes of an owl as they watch
Throw in that towel or get thrown in a ditch

[Verse 5: HOPE]
Or get thrown on the pit, I was thrown on stages
Tab, Centennial, Westchester lacing
My flow ’96, your flow ‘06
Your flow “eh, cool…”, my flow “oh shit!”

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
You flow don’t exist, we co-exist with the UFOs
Goddamnit, stranded on planets that you don’t know
The aliens panic, pack they bags, they hit the road
The truth, the phone booth, the greatness take its toll

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar
This for the town, nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I'm from the Hub City, yeah, that Compton court building
Caught a murder when his homie died, judge caught feelings
I'm on Rosecrans, chilling right inside Best Outlest
Five dollar Little Caesar, momma shopped at Food-4-Less
Elementary McNair, say what's up to Vanguard
Centennial High, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it neutral
But I'm well aware that a square can get shot too
Most Crip and some Piru, that's just how the game go
Hood on every corner, stop for gas and get your brains blown
Bitches with fat asses, burning in the stashes
Murders in July, call that summer time madness
Rest in peace 4 Bent, rest in peace Mausberg
Swear to God, when I make it big, your voice'll be heard
Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it positive
Though I know it's chaos, forever my heart will live in

[Chorus: Alori Joh]
Compton, concrete jungle
Where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in Compton
These streets will make you or break you
Expire or inspire you
Let's hear it for Compton
Compton, Compton

(Verse 2)
Take you back to Y.E.T it was just divining me
Earl had got disciplined for not catching a fade that week
Shit had made him stronger though, yeah those were the good old days
Eating Tam's burger while my Juvenile CD had played
21 outside maybe sideline pop
Yellow tape on sidewalk damn somebody got popped
Hoping that I live a lot, I don't want to die young
Please don't come shoot up my party, I just want to have fun
Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fuck the police
Pull me over just to plant an 8 ball on me
Fuck it though I'm out here, I've always been out here
Since the Compton swap meet, black and red LA gears
Pac was on Rosecrans nigga I was right there
Cali Love video he said whattup I said yeah
Free my nigga J-Dub and both of the J-Mans
Eazy paved the way, Lil Eazy bout to get it in for..

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I'm talking bout Westside Piru, N.H.P., Campanella, Carver Park
Front Hood, Nutty Blocc, Lantana, 151, Park Village
Cedar Block, Santana

Peace! Peace!

All a nigga really want for us to keep
Peace! Peace!

But I'm pushing to get us there in no time
Me, I'm just a good kid hoping I can spread love
Word to the county building forever I do it for...

Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo, pistachio
Just done mash a show, Dawg is off on sabbatical
Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic
CNN and all this shit, gwaan yo, move with the fuckery
Trump and the SNL hilarity
Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy
Blood clot, you doing, bullshit you spewing
As if this country ain't already ruined
In lieu of these mumbling, fumbling
Swearing they're the greatest
Online they debate us, if we different, then we're haters
We ended our hiatus, the dogs looking for food
The nucleus is here now (ooo)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone, song of Revelation
Reverends and cattles racing
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy
Fumigate our economy, 'lluminate broken dreams
And manifest all insanity, look around
Sayonara tomorrow, it's just blood on the ground

Omega, Black Hippy came through to switch flavors (Uh)
Wake and bake, no taters
Pa-pass me the ketchup, I'll homestyle fry 'em (Fry)
(You niggas better catch up as swift as I am)
I was born in Zion, I defeated the Lion
Soul made of iron, yeah, Soul made of iron
Nah, nigga talking how you can't fold when you trying (Oh)
Strive for triumph
Survive by any means necessary even if it means dying
Fuck the world missionary, Malcolm got popped
Obama got in office, and I'm still on the block (Yeah)
Ain't shit changed, the grinding never stops
Call it progress, and the reason why the chicks always fall in our nest
Two niggas getting high, flying objects (Hahaha)
We got next, now forever the Hippy is black interrogated by
Instrumentals that give me a rhythm
Put the maize together and blaze (Don't be afraid), hey
See, this is how we do
Would say I thought you knew but that would not be true
In fact, ve Q (You fags are through)
And like all of you teachers thus far

Activist (Black Hippet)
Rebel without a cause
Full clip left you stiff like a mannequin
Hit him in his temple, left him at the Taj Mahal, what you on
I'm on some other shit, feeling like I stepped off the mothership
We sabotage the government (Uh-huh)
CIA gotta evacuate when we done
The state troopers would call off the shooters at dead run
It's going down I said (Boogie down, down)
Boogie down Bronx (In a black borrow hound)
Bumping Biggie like (Pac ain't dead)
Two side call it Twenty-two (Uh)
I'm twenty-two and I rap like twenty zoos
Mm, straight animal
Ace Ventura couldn't find no cure
So raw probably bite off the face of Hannibal
Protein shakes, acid, and manure

[Intro: Big Sean]
Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that "Juicy" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far

Murder wack rappers peacefully,listen breathe easily/
Seems to me you hate seeing me spit but bitch leave me be/
These sick ass bars make you nauseous watch your back keep cautious/
I'm the little engine that could i know i can't stop this/
I'm the fucking feces i tear mc's into pieces/
I eat all you dumb asses for breakfast like wheaties/
Some days i don't have enough middle fingers to go round/
Fuck the doubt the time is now to make all my haters proud/
Wanna hook i'll give you a hook going straight through your jaws/
Strictly lyrical something spiritual nothing but bars/
Fuck opponents look at music components their composing/
You know wits owning, everyone else fake they just posing/
I'm one earth to enlighten to spark the brain like lightning/
To brighten up your world so much to leave haters sightless/
They put you down like yey low down on the ground like jay lo/
But you gotta rise up from all the hate and say hell no/
Sometimes your exhausted don't have inspiration lost it/
Haters mouths keep running like faucets blabbering nonsense/
We've all been fucking suppressed oppressed too stressed to get rest/
Thats exactly why their obsessed to get you upset/
Our main goal as humans is be shaded by money trees/
Money heats money feeds,let me tell you what money means/
Of course we need it but most of us spend for wrong reasons/
Not feeding needy who be pleading the streets weakly/
Instead we buy the ps3's psp's 360's while people out their struggling to eat/
Yo, in order to change the world we need to change ourselves/
Have you seen the news lately fucking world going to hell/
Let us come together fuck dividing stop the lying/
Were going straight to extinction the future is coming start the thinking/
Plan ahead before we're all dead/

Sugar, let me kiss you crazy, massage your feet
Girl it's cool, girl it's cool
We lay out, baby come and run away with me
Lock you up, find the key
To these adventures baby come around and see
Past the stars, through the trees
To a better living, baby come and grab a seat

Never? Oh, okay, alright, okay bye, bye

Greeting boys and girls (Greetings boys and girls)
My name is Petey P (My name is Petey P)
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (That’s right, that's right, that's right)
I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor)
And I’d like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city (good kid, m.A.A.d city)
So grab your cartoons and cereal (And sing)
Your pop guns and fireworks (And sing)
And sing along (Along)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Sing along kids, sing along
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah

[Verse 1]
Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...
I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancin'
Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
Oh yeah, I remember that, it- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?
[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Am I right?
Spend it all in front of the county building
Oh!
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah

And all the ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)

When we grow up, when we grow up (Aye, oh)
Ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)

All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)

[Verse 2]
Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (Uh-huh)
Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty (Yeah, yeah that)
Seven, do the math, ‘92, don’t you be lazy (I won't)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers
Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
"Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out?" He said, "Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich
Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget
Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither
Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots"
That- that’s right the mothafuckin’ Rodney King...
You was with your daddy on Bullis Road
[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
That's crazy
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
Don't forget, still sing along kids, still sing along
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Please sing
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane

I've spit that wonder rhymin' shit since thirteen
Uh, motherfucker, I been rhymin' it, it's timin', kid
That's all it's 'bout in this life
If you want to jump in this game, then think twice
Curly-haired nigga, nappy-head flows
Remember eighth grade, I started gettin' all my hoes
Started rockin' all these shows, jumpin' on stages
Readin' in rap books, flipped so many pages
Flipped so many stages in my life
I must admit, I've always been the shit
With the written or the freestyle, a nigga been wild
Get free shoes for my nigga Q now
[Inaudible] or jump shot, all type of Jordan
He say, 'Wait, get anythin' that's important'
Exclusive shit, not the shit Wade be rockin'
You know, [inaudible] said he used the word 'stocking'
Cat with them big-ass jerseys and fake Js
[Inaudible], you ain't fuckin' with these

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Some shit in the barber shop
(Uh, nah, like, I ain't been to the barber shop, nigga
Who's takin' my shit to the barber shop?)
Nigga, I'll gets you owned now
I guess everybody know your songs now
(Now, now I can give you free shoes)
Shoes, uh-huh, uh (I can give you free shoes)
Yo, you gettin' free shoes
How many raps have I wrote?
How many words that I spoke?
How many shit I jot in jail just for others to quote?
That's what my man just brought up
I'm thinkin' 'bout this industry, I'm all caught up
I can't get out, I'm like Charlotte's Web
Lookin' at my shit, can download it on the Web
I'm so confused with these tools
Recycled other dudes
I'm talkin' the greatest, I'm talkin' about legends
I'm talkin' 'bout your rhymes, that shit is half-steppin'
That shit is mad depressin', I'm tryin' to enlighten the city
I'm tryin' to get all the hoes to get with me

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Rap, is it really worth it?
Should I keep doin' it on purpose
Should I jump in the booth? I used to get nervous
But now I'm just the truth like the motherfuckin' Bible
Tabernacle, spin around twice
Shondo, you tell me that I'm nice, yeah

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
[Inaudible] want me to handle this
But I just already sat on it
(Oh, yeah, and I got that for free too
Yeah, Q, what it do?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch
These niggas teed out here, my nigga
These niggas teed out here, bitch
You niggas teed out here, bitch
You niggas teed out here, bitch
You niggas teed out here

[Verse 5: ScHoolboy Q]
Ain't late for shit no more
I ain't never paid for shit no more
I just walk up in the stall, say, 'Gimme this'
'Aye, gimme that', I ain't got a rack
Yo, I got a sack, we can blow it in the back
Couple hoes gettin' twisted in the 'Lac
Dave got the 'dro, Kendrick got nothin'
Soul got a dime, I'm tryin' to sip another little cup of wine
They ain't get a dime
Sit back, twist up a [inaudible]
Swisher, I give a fuck, never miss you, I'd kiss you
Never cool as the bitch, I'm the shit, give a fuck
Fucked up and I still rip it up

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, niggas walkin' in with choppers and I don't know
They act like it's a camera
Shootin' everybody on the floor
See, he got the army jeans on
This nigga finna get his beam on
Tryin' to wear a beanie like me

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Motherfuckin' plaid motherfuckin' shirts
[Inaudible] at the bottom and shit
Old-ass Jordans and shit
I'd put y'all up on some free motherfuckin' shoes
Now you want to act like your ass got [inaudible]
Big-ass bomber coat like you from New York
Go outside and smoke them cheap-ass Newports
Feelin' like [inaudible] on your ass

[Intro]
Uh, go
Uh, go

[Chorus]
Too many M's to make (To make)
Too many rules to break (To break)
Too many fightin' that case (That case)
I gotta find my way (My way)
Daughter need new shoes (Shoes)
If I lose, she lose (Lose)
And I ain't gettin' used to losses

[Verse 1]
Days like this, I wish all my locs was unchained (Chained)
I mastered the rap game (Game), I mastered the dope game (Game)
Still I feel like that I'm God-like on these long flights
I'm left behind, it don't feel right
Can't write the script when this real life
Rich, still dodgin' that bus ride
From the west side where don't shit slide, we on trip time
Seen the field in their lies (Their lies)
Can't be serious with no rappers (No rappers)
Stayed down and what happened? (What happened?)
Got my daughter that mansion (That mansion)
Gave my mother that million (Million)
Sold my soul to my feelings (My feelings)
Can't go blind 'bout these women (No)
[Chorus]
Too many M's to make (To make)
Too many rules to break (To break)
Too many fightin' that case (That case)
I gotta find my way (My way)
Daughter need new shoes (Shoes)
If I lose, she lose (Lose)
And I ain't gettin' used to losses
I'm goin' off 'til I crash
Fuck all the opps, I kid you not, see we gon' crash
My thoughts is sick, I don't have no sense, sometimes I crash
Pour up this 1942, it knock me on my...
It knock me on my...

[Verse 2]
Nigga gotta hit the golf course to get a peace of mind
Family friends want a piece of mine
I can tell they all piecin' up
And I can show 'em where peace resides
Since eight years old, I knew I'd be rich
'Cause the college route, it wasn't 'bout shit
Tried the honest route, but chose house licks
Tried to lock me up, but can't catch this
Now where we touch down is on my X list, I'm on a fresh tip
Too much time of livin' reckless
Now add that time up on my left wrist
Lil' rappers ain't impressive (Ain't impressive)
Your tax bracket ain't impressive (Ain't impressive)
You buy a chain, but won't buy no land
That hashtag should say, "Desperate" (Desperate)
I'm kickin' game for these young niggas
'Cause one day they'll meet my daughter, uh
All that bullshit I taught her, huh
Way too blessed to be normal, uh
Upper echelon, where we stand at
So, girl, be proud that your skin black
And be happy, girl, that your hair napped
'Cause the school system won't teach that
Where your father been, you gon' reach that
[Chorus]
Too many M's to make (To make)
Too many rules to break (To break)
Too many fightin' that case (That case)
I gotta find my way (My way)
Daughter need new shoes (Shoes)
If I lose, she lose (Lose)
And I ain't gettin' used to losses
I'm goin' off 'til I crash
Fuck all the opps, I kid you not, see we gon' crash
My thoughts is sick, I don't have no sense, sometimes I crash
Pour up this 1942, it knock me on my...
It knock me on my...[Verse 1: Rozzi Crane]
Yeah, hes got such a pretty face
Hes been calling me for days I'll give him a try
Student body, best in class, got me foolish for that ass
Yeah, He's one of a kind
First date said "I love you," second date met his mother
Now his leaving all his shit in my place
He's been looking through my phone,  breaking in when no one's home
Zero to sixty this boy's going crazy

[Hook]
Now now you're out of control now baby
I know you're not in love but I can't get enough
Cause when you go down baby, yes I know now baby
Gotta have a glass of hitch with this crazy ass bitch
He's a crazy ass bitch

[Verse 2: Rozzi Crane]
He's picking fights outside the bar
Slashing the tires in my car, what the hell is the deal
But if we get into a fight, he just turns out all the lights
Then he's got me for real
Third date kept it cool, fourth date act a fool
He's a feisty motherfucker for sure
God damn just relax, if you wanna make it last
Zero to sixty this boy's going crazy
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck that, you fucked up, a fatal attraction, good luck
The way that I'm reacting to your love
Cupid shot twice, you can't duck
Stupid is what stupid does huh
You probably thinkin' I'm tweaking off on a drug huh
You probably thinkin' I'm creeping up on your work place
Tweeterin' when you in the club huh?
Straight like that though
Rain on your parade in Seattle
And your mom complain that I'm an asshole
I'm tryna' put it in your unh (X3)
My little tadpoles
Swim, swim, good, left, stroke, right, stroke
I wish we could elope and remote to Rio
Rewrote my vows, I shall devote
Everything I lose and then gain
All I need is your attention
All I need is your now I would go to war
If them papers said to restrain
Hold up
Lookin' in your window trying to see what I could find
I don't really ask for much all I want is your time
Everything I lose and then gain
All I need is your attention
All I need is your, now I would go to war
If them paper said to restrain
Strain (4x)
Hold up

Pour up another shot of Hennessy, my tendency to start the party with
Probably hit that Bob Marley, I ain't with that Molly shit
Represent my nigga, bang your hood
Bloods and Crips in the same building, it's all good
I'm looking at this pretty fine thing rolling with her friend
Hoping I can make her mind change, jump inside my Benz
Let me get it cracking
Conversation turn to plenty sexual frustration
Fuck-faces looking at her, hard to not be impatient
Oh, really though?
You drink? You smoke?
Get a case, get a 1/8, fly high not coach
G5, sit back I'll drive, let me know
On the couch, on the bed, on the floor, say go
Say when, in the wind, we go
We toast to the game, no games, we both really grown
I'm saying, you playing, I mean, I dance
To my own beat, to the beat now flip your hands and
Let the smoke burn, let the smoke burn in your vein
When it's your turn hit it twice then say my name
Say my name, say my name, I appear like Candyman
Dark chocolate, vanilla, I tell you this is Candy Land
This is Candid Camera, there's no pauses allowed
They don't understand us because we won't turn it down
Middle fingers in the air, this is truth and double dare
300 drunk muthafuckas in the holding cell

[Refrain: Mayer Hawthorne]
We just wanna party
We don't mean no harm
Don't wanna hurt nobody
But they make it so hard
We just wanna party
Just wanna rock all night
Don't wanna hurt nobody
No need to be uptight

I got my cross-trainers on, motherfucker, I run shit
All I do is rap, make dough for the dumb shit
The return of that 808 trunk hit
Cash in my palm, I'mma pass the baton, GO!
Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet (go!)
Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet (go!)
Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet
Cash in my palm, I'mma pass the baton

[Verse 1: Like]
You be on that fuck shit, I'm tryin' to make bucks quick
Don't talk to me if money ain't the subject
93's laced up, we about to run shit
Mibbs right beside me, BeYoung got the blunt lit
Shawn on the cut, Swiff D on the drum kits
Standin' on your table with a bottle and a drunk bitch
Fallin' all over spillin' drinks, tryin' to tongue kiss
Money over hoes, so you know I ain't the one, Miss
Take her home, make her moan, and when I get done: (Switch!)
Pass her off like a basketball
Stay with dimes, I'm like Nash to y'all
My living room look like a casting call
Don't be bringing hoes with Noassatall
A sweet talkin' nigga, ask your mom
My nigga, that's your squad?
We treat line-ups like that's Lebron
Push backwards like the bush whackers
We ain't just kush rappers - we max it out like FootAction

[Verse 2: BeYoung]
Nigga hand over fist, bring some cash in this bitch
Y'all niggas picture near puttin' swag in your spliffs
My niggas cop the 7 just to laugh at the 6
Like "nigga, do you know how much ass I'mma get?"
Wrote a plan out, let's dip, we can market and sing
Put that cash in a stash, save that part for the rent
Only way niggas swingin' is to target the fence
That's why everything we're singing hit the target like Prince, man
I'm talkin' vanity and cannabis
Stickin' to the strategy, how simple can it be?
Niggas comin' home we gon' put them on the salary
Niggas think they cold 'til we push our shit to Calgary

[Verse 3: Blu]
Yea, you're who-blah and your shoe rot
You're too shy to be Rah Rah, your due ska
Your new job from Calgary to the new spot
Threw that 2Pac on, but couldn't ride like we used 'ta
Used up, you're new guy's shoe size
Drew ties, never move pies, move lines
She do lines, why we shoot rhymes, shoo fly
Don't bother the father, just let me do mine

[Verse 4: Mibbs]
It's notorious, peep it
Y'all niggas is Victoria's Secret
Soft as Mom's lingerie
It's a man's world boy, put the pom-poms away
It's only right we got our palms on LA
'Cause if Pac was alive, you'd get bombed on today
Bombs bombs away, like 'Bron-'Bron and Wade
We been had next, now it's our time to play, nigga

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Your false prophets will never jump in my pockets
You're poppin' your gums and I'm poppin' your optics
Optimus Prime when I'm done
And the topic of music is me
And the logic is usually
You should stop in and grab a degree
In the science of how to emcee
And I'm watchin' the critics critique
When I'm climbing the valleys and peaks
And aligning myself
While I'm riding Orion's belt
In the street and defiling this beat
As a dead bitch that lay at my feet
This is King shit...

[Hook]
I got my cross-trainers on, motherfucker, I run shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar, tone what up,check it out
As the day go I let the beat rock
Then put my thoughts inside the cradle, hip hops
God Father plant the seed, you should be my son
And if you niggas hot, I guess I am the sun
I'm a degree away from global warming, this a warning
Shot like I knew Big but I'm enormous
I hear an Instrumental then I turn to Norman
So go tell ‘em I killed it you fucking informant
I’m always performing
Like it’s my last morning
Before I sit with the Lord and see my mother mourning
I’m in the air with it like a new pair of Jordans
Ground level never been important when I walk the earth
Walk to church bishop said he lost his Bible this time
Told me that he need a verse, I blessed him with a couple of lines
Bear hugged a few bears, wrestle with a couple of lions
That’s the imagery I delivery when I fuck a rhyme…
Fuck off, Kendrick Lamar

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]

Jay Rock motherfuckers you know what comes after that
My town I rep it till im off this map
Watts City, Eastside baby
Chillin in the bricks with bricks looking for fifty
It’s still in my blood, nigga it’s all natural
Welcome to L.A gangbang Capital, Still rocking my colours I wasn't sworn in it
I ain't a millennium baby,look I was born in it
Bless the beat when I speak everytime, cocaine bars that tweakin off every line
I’m in deep space now when I write, no pen no pad in my mind when I write
Flow bolder than a cold on a polar bear, shhh im the one that this rap niggas fear
You can’t do me, this game’s like an ocean catch a nigga floating on the top like a boat…Rock!

[Verse 3: Microphone Tone]
Lil Watts lil Compton in the dash of the East
Kendrick Lamar, Rock, and Tone put you back in your seat
A natural beat
Got me like a savage and beast
The rap game start to look like an immaculate feast
I'm back in this piece
So listen when the package complete
Join the cause or hit the hills when disaster released
The passion in me
Got me spittin' accurately
So the realest MC is what I happen to be
You can vibe wit it or move back
These new jacks gettin blue black
With boom bap I proved that
Know my Golden State affiliates can prove that
On my menace shit Long Beach Venice shit
Primitive the way I crafted this all the penmanship
It's intricate now go and start the sirens
My microphone's on the flow is sparking violence
We the best duo out since Bo and Marcus Allen



[Verse One: ZZ Ward]
Baby, nobody knows a word that you saying
Your breath is reeking like whiskey, what hair you got left is graying
You’re out on my porch yelling, waking the neighbors
Wanting me to come and save you with your aggressive behavior

[Hook: ZZ Ward]
You’re stumbling all over town, you drink till you drown
You keep on threatening to bring me down
You don’t make the rules, you drunk old fool
See, you don’t scare me, you’re just crying wolf
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy

[Verse Two: ZZ Ward]
Breaking my door down when I left the lock open
There ain’t much left to be broken
If lies are wet, then you’re soaking
It’s like the Devil just jumped up in your clothes
He put on your shoes and rolled
And still you're scared to be alone

[Hook 2: ZZ Ward & Kendrick Lamar]
You’re stumbling all over town, you drink till you drown
You keep on threatening to bring me down
You don’t make the rules, you drunk old fool
See, you don’t scare me, you’re just crying wolf
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry, cry boy
Cry, cry boy, cry boy
Nobody knows what you’re saying (I mean, you need to)
I know the game that you’re playing (I mean, you need to)

[Verse Three: Kendrick Lamar]
Don’t forget about us, don’t forget about trust
Don’t forget about the kinkiness of playin' with the cuffs on a bedspring
Penetrate the loud screams, echo in the hallway is a must
I could never let go if I wanna whore, duck, away from your anatomy
The agony is such a pain I could never endure even if I had the cure
With the pure, sweet morphine touch, I mean, I cannot deny my demise to lies
That interrupted our future, I mean, if I compromise, will you improvise?
Please don’t pin no lies, I’m used to you forgivin' and then you forget the truth
I promise that I’ll commit, vamoose to all my old ways
I’m done howlin' today, a full moon will never exist, I swear

[Intro]
Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo!

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off
[Chorus 1]
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say...

[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off
[Chorus 2]
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

[Verse 3]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep
[Chorus 3]
'Cause everytime y'all come around
Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up
Keep it running, Ali
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

[Outro]
So tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!"
Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
You thirsty, you boo-boo
You T, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You thirsty, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you weak
You weak, yo’ bitch weak
Yo- (laughs)
You boo-boo, you T (laughs)
Keep all that

[Interlude]
What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it’s known today that the human race is nothing
No morals, no standards
What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
No, you don’t have to have a lot of money
You don’t have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion

Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood
Came to town with Death Cab for Cutie
I stayed home with my wife and child
And a six pack of beer
I pondered that name for 15 minutes
After I saw the poster stapled to a phone pole
On the corner of Grand and 21st

That was a couple of years ago
I was already in my forties then
So I didn't go out on a whim just to see
A band called Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood
Just because I liked the name
Just because I'm 25 and every day's a stoned summer day
My band's always giggin' then
REM was still kickin' then
I drove that Ford Grenada Mom and Dad gave to me
After they got 'em a Ford LTD
And there was music on MTV
I smoked my manager's pot
And got laid quite a lot

Planes hadn't flown into towers yet
And we didn't have a loose cannon president
We didn't have all this credit card debt
Hangin' over the house like a cloud
Ensurin' there's not much more druggin' allowed
A body won't take it, wallet can't hang
Singin' all the songs I've sang for years
And when it's a band gig it's rockin'
And when it's solo the people are talkin' while I'm singin'
Make me depressed, you think I could take a hint?
My time came and went
Hell there's many nights I came and went
In a manner of speaking my conscience is sleeping
The world is changing the good times are gone
We get to be the folks who greet the dawn
Of an age of distrust, surveillance and sleaze
And bombs in shoes and way too many enemies

I bet their name was Menstrual Blood
And the A&R guy said "That's no good
Make it Mystery and then we can target
A broader base of Goth dog lover market"

I love my boy, he's becoming a drummer
Got a drum kit from Santa, at this rate by summer
He'll be keepin' a beat in a world that needs a metronome
Shoved up its ass so hard that
All voices will raise in the heavenly choir
Shit'll get straight, brothers will hug
We'll dance like we did in the decades of drugs
I'm spittin' my genes in an ocean that's risin'
Clingin' to Jesus with some compromisin'
Of how it was handed to me from my mom
And my daddy the preacher who watched all that TV
In a cream recliner
Scroungin' through life like a stoned hardliner
You couldn't faze him, he knew Jesus
Died for his sins and was raised from the dead
And I've always wondered, why can't he stay dead?
It doesn't change any good thing he said
What matters is his life and not how he died
Why can't he just be a nice Jewish guy?
Who was super clued in and showed us the way
To salvation from sin
And that doesn't mean that you're not quote-unquote "saved"
You fry like a piece of country ham in your grave
It's a great big world, life is a joke
Arabs and Christians, Pepsi and Coke
People so gorgeous it causes 'em pain
And nobody gives any  sympathy for something like that
You suffer in silence or form a band
With a name that appeals to Goth dog lovers everywhere
On a poster that's seen by a forty-ish bastard
Walkin' to work at 8:15
$11 an hour for all that he does
Can't be a has-been if you never was
Goin' all day long without eatin'
Till all my nerve endings are seriously overheatin'
I get wobbly walkin' down the stairs
To smoke me a cigarette in the cold fresh air
Wonderin' why I do the things I do
And I do 'em every day
And it can't turn out good livin' this way
But live this life I must and
In some fuzzy God I trust
I'll kiss my wife, I'll kiss my son and
Maybe someday I'll go for a run
Maybe someday a song will stick
I'll walk around like I got a big boat
Maybe someday my boy'll drum in a
Hippie jam band that plays out some
He'll take after Daddy, get in the van
Go somewhere only young people can
Doing things only young people do
Bangin' those skins at Bonnaroo
Rockin' the dreadheads, dancin' in the mud
Before Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood
God go with him, Amen

[Part 1: Darkside]

[Intro: King Mez]
Where you at? Where you from?
Whatcha doing over here, motherfucker?
Whatcha think? What you bang?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game

[Verse 1: King Mez]
Now I ain't never been no gangsta
But I know niggas, know niggas from the darkside
There's some cold killas, cold killas (My nanny used to tell me)
My nigga used to roll with us, roll with us (Every night)
Married to the more money, more women
Now I ain't ever been the one that'll pull a gun on you
But I know who got 'em
No, I never sold no drugs, homie
But I know who got 'em
And I never had no fucking bullets in me
But I know who got 'em
Mmmmm, heeeey-heeeeeey
If you die tonight, you die tonight
Momma might cry tonight if she find you high off the dynamite
But to you, well, it's just another Friday night
Got a nigga feeling kinda nice
With the Bible right beside that pile of white
That's what this life is like
(Now do you love your life?)
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now please don't give me a reason, reason
'Cause I know you wanna keep breathing this evening
I've been killing the game for seasons, believe him
That I'm the motherfuckin' one to breed them and lead 'em
In a league of my own
You ain't even made it up to my throne
You ain't even authorized for this song
Might be best for you to get goin'
Best be careful about your tone
That shit can hit me wrong and it's on
I have tried my best to be calm
Please don't make me grab that phone (Uh-oh)
Now who you know who came this fucking far
From the fucking bottom?
Thirty years in this bitch and I'm still here
Decade after decade
And evidently I must be doing somethin' right
Word to my nigga Eazy

[Interlude: Eazy-E]
Eazy-E C-P-T OG from the other side (Eazy)
From the other side (Eazy)

[Part 2: Gone]
[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
I went from hanging out down at the swap meet
To driving some of the hottest cars L.A. has ever seen
People been tellin' me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though, I've been this way since seventeen
Tryna get finances poppin', man, I thought that was the object
'Til some of my niggas lost they life and then there goes the team
My only dream was holding it down, like, fuck who tryna stop us
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm, young and black
Killing them softly
Don't ever call me fortunate, you don't know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me, homie
We ain't even talkin', fuck that energy, fuck up off me, ugh!

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
You look at my lifestyle
I'm living my life now
I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin
How come my attitude piped down?
I'm fucking with Ice now
I'm fucking with shit that you only can get
On an oversea flight now
You scared of my heights now
But still, I got enemies giving me energy
I wanna fight now
Subliminal, sending me all of this hate
I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up
I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video?
But really, no clue, you idiot
I just can't help myself
Even when that record spin
Every now and then, you hang yourself
'Cause I got the green and gold (With a million sold)
Plus plenty more, (and my dollar thicker)
But with or without the diamonds, though
(To you) I'm just another (Nigga!)

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

[Outro: Marsha Ambrosius]
You'll find out when I'm gone

[Intro]
Yeah, follow me, uh

[Verse]
Picture Kendrick, one of the greatest emcees
Roamin' the coast like cellphones on airplane mode
I been at bat for so many years
Now I'm out swingin' like open marriages
Carry this terrorist flow, say that I'm arrogant
Stop playin', thinkin' back to rhymin' over computer mics
Knew I was tight the moment the speakers had broke
I dipped and dabbled in chronic, but never knew I was dope
You see, my uncles is killers, but never knew I could smoke
A rapper like a .357, do worse enemies
Was God-given, but now I'm God, hate to intervene
I sick a lyric on you like K-9's from the police
Let it rip through your briefs, till it bite through your culo
I'm Cujo, (you) sumo actor, (me) sumo rapper
Heavy in the game, follow my name, K-Dizzle
A twenty-two-year-old dream, got now
Like a person place or thing hands down like 6:30
You heard me? I'm a motherfuckin' problem, puto
Give me respect, I hold it down for DJBooth.net
And they tell 'em K-Dot got next
And they tell 'em K-Dot got necked
From your baby momma
On my momma, brain like a genius
I'm travelin' to Venus
Where aliens got pistols 'round they V-necks
Snub-nose, Kleenex
I suppose I done drove artists to a place
Where the daily deceased sleep at
Competition comin' up short like a dwarf
But, of course, I'm a short fuse ready to blow
Go 'head and put your gun down, we can go toe-to-toe
Mano e mano, you ain't ready, I'm deadly as plec disease
God-given, you trippin', I've walked the Seven Seas
Moses, cold as they heart, cloned as art
Foamin' at the mouth, wildebeest slaughter opponents
'Bout business when I kicks this, ridiculous symphony
Tick-tock, boom when you infants give me some room
Central and Rosecrans, Compton don't raise killers
They raise Conans with survival tactics
You love drama? Well, welcome to the land of theatrics
Even a preacher be packin' like role managers damage your goods
Cameras roll through the hood, tryin' to get that footage
Even newscasters come to your block when you wouldn't
This the city at it's best, have a seat, hold your breath
A breath of fresh air, DJBooth.net and Dot
Kendrick Lamar, K-Dot, that is, ha-ha-ha, ha, yeah

[Intro: Ab-Soul & (Kendrick Lamar)]
My nigga, do you have a gas can?
(The fuck I'm gonna do with a gas can, nah, nigga what?)
It's just been a long ass day, man
All I need is a gas can
(Na, try down across the street, I think that nigga keep one, I don't know)
I'm finna head over there and I'mma be right back
(Fuck what you doing, man?
Knocking on the door extra hard and shit like you just stressed out or something)
My nigga, I don't even know where to begin, dog
(What happened, man?)

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Look, I woke up this morning feeling fucked up
What else is new? Like God be like, "To hell with you"
To tell the truth, I ain't been to church in like three or fo'
Years, not months, have mercy on my soul
Threw on the wife-beater, put a fitted on my skull
Took a long ass piss, grabbed my shades and hit the door
I had half a blunt left from last night
I lit that bitch up like a lightbulb and got right
Started to orchestrate my day like a maestro
I should hit the lab, I got verses like the Bible
I heard hip hop need revival
It's been camouflaged like the mascot for Geico
In that bullshit, I took another pull quick
My mind flooded like a fucking swimming pool is
Went back in the house, raided my mom's refrigerator
But everybody's on a diet and my stomach ain't quiet
I said, "Fuck it", hit the shower like a jackpot
The weed got my teeth off-white like crack rock
Toothbrush from the 99 cent store
I got a million dollar smile, it don't make sense though
Threw on my army fatigue shorts and a T that say "Peace Not War"
Now everybody eyeing me
I don't know if I need an iron or it's the irony
And by the way, I'm at the gas station now
But not to get gas, just another black and mild
Shit this half a half a tank gon' have to last until Monday
And it's Tuesday, the bitches still want me like a bouquet
I hit my nigga Agent, he want to roll up two Ls like Cool J
I'm like, "Alright, cool, Jay"
But I gotta be at work by 3, it's midday
I can't go in smelling like weed, he said, "Okay"
Stop by the cheap tobacco store, two swishers for a dollar
And when he meet me, we finna get high, like a greeting
He told me, "Drop five", I said, "I got you next time"
Long story short, I bumped my head on cloud nine
And I'm chilly chill even when it's hot outside
Rode to the studio rather blasted
I spit like a dragon that'll leave a fan flabbergasted
That's when my gas and my check engine light
Clicked on at the same exact time I signal right
And that ain't right, I got shit to do today
Cause any day you could be attending my eulogy
Got to the studio when everybody left
I saw a note that read, "We went to go work on Detox with Weezy F"
[Break: Kendrick Lamar & (Ab-Soul)]
My fault nigga, I actually came up with the idea to write that
(You laughin' but that shit ain't funny man)
It was funny at first but

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
A day in the life
Of mister soul brother number deuce
Damn he nice
I'm thinking if you only knew
You could fuck with it or middle fingers up to your whole crew
Tell 'em the regular nigga said it and that it
A day in the life
Of mister soul brother number deuce
Damn he nice
I'm thinking if you only knew
You could fuck with it or middle fingers up to your whole crew

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul & (Kendrick Lamar)]
Now it's 2:58 and I'm running late for work
Running meanin' stuck in traffic cause the Home Depot is finna jerk
I been in the same position before
Manager said it better be my last time, but it won't
I clocked in around 3:10 and I'm wishing I didn't
Cause UPS just brought in this big ass shipment
And for those that don't know, I work at a record store
And I make hot records (That's a sick ass gimmick)
Finished the inventory then I logged on Myspace
I had one download and 'bout 16 plays
5 friend requests from sucka MCs making a name
I signed out and had to question my aim (You weak nigga, that's all)
This old-timer walked in and we got to talking about Eric B and Rakim
And the perm on Al Sharpton
Osama bin Laden, Obama in the office
And he looked me in my face and said I'm destined for fame
Told him I do music, he like, "Whatever you do, do it
And don't blink, the moment you close your eyes, you'll lose it"
Word to wise, that was some great advice
That I took like I stole it, then my head sort of swollen
I guess that's why I shits on 'em like a cleansed colon
Told the rest of the shoppers we finna be closing
I locked up like Akon and hit the street
It's 8 PM, and I ain't had shit to eat
All day, KFC, snackers a dollar each
Bar-b-que and nacho cheese
I bought 4, ate 3, gave one to Top Dawg
I would've had one for Punch but he moved like a sloth
I'm back at the studio now if I lost ya
And everything's straight, you can thank great posture
Hit my lil momma up cause I'm trying to cut
But she on the rag and I don't mean a bandanna
She told me come through, she gave me head like Rihanna
And I deserve a standing ovation for my swagger
Chuck the deuce, headed for the car to finish off the night right
But it wouldn't start
[Outro: Ab-Soul & (Kendrick Lamar)]
Laugh it up nigga, laugh it up man
Shit ain't funny man, that's why I need that damn gas can
(Gas, nigga, you gotta put 5 dollars not 3 in)
Shit nigga I ain't got 5 dollars to put in!
(That'll get you one gallon, nigga)
Whatever man, bullshit dog, keep laughin'
(Tryin' to save that extra dollar for that menu
For the McDonalds menu nigga ain't gotta cut all the time
Nigga you gotta put the whole 5 in it)
You gon' shoot me 5 or what? Fuckin' bastard
(I know you're on a budget, but damn)[Produced by Ski Beatz]

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I defy odds even if I divide y'all
At least 10 percent of my rhythm is arithmetic
Killer with the wit, drench em in the spit
Infrared hot, chillin' with your bitch, you're dead right
You're dead wrong without your dead presidents
I'm an old head but Ab stack bread present tense
What part about making money represents you?
You're on the broke side, I rock your boat ride, don't cry
Get your paper up like hands at my shows
I send this verse through MoneyGram
A hundred grand for my flow
Aside from the fast cars and the chains that glow
There's gotta be a better way to go
Like them backstreets, ducking them sobriety tests
Blunt in the ashtray, Colt45 on your breath
Fuck what Ab say, I told Carlito it's that way
Blow dinero, torpedo through your national bank and
Pay attention, niggas

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
Get, get money my niggas
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
Get, get money my bitches
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You probably thinking I'm aggravated when I say I foresee the future
Minus the white boy on Final Destination
They say it's one Nation under God
But my reality, one person under a gun
And the funny thing
My paper chasing just begun
Still premature and being the black entrepeneur
In this world where we lust for more money, cash and whores
Got me defining life without my high school thesaurus
Blink twice when you see my Porsche headlights
My car is better than yours
I rub it in, like over-the-counter ointment
You're in desperation thinking that you can coexist
With the immortal vocalist, Ford dealerships ain't this focussed
Even when barefooted, the funky rhythm I still kick
Dead presidents is the medicine for my evil heart
More Franks than a ballpark, porcupine sharp
When I dress, when I talk, a dollar bill eject
My conversations about money, what you expect?

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
Get, get money my niggas
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
Get, get money my bitches
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Ab-Soul]
Finna diminish any nigga tryna get involved
The fuck they be thinking? Nothing at all
They go against, but still can't float against
No options, flows like a cheese pizza, no topping
Big rig through both lanes, you play possum
You can't see me, flow cleaner than the water made by Fiji
Money clip like feed me, flyer than an airman straight from Tuskegee
Shoot you out the air man, bring your high down
The next morning your hungover from the sober sound
Or the four pound, Soviet Unions in your town
What your homies doin?
Theres some more bullets to go around, now
We can all get paper like Xerox
Or we can just reset Tetris and clear blocks
Or better yet sum us out the money and buy stock
Or call Will to the car dealer and buy the lots
Getting paid period, every hour on the dot

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
Get, get money my niggas
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny
Get, get money my bitches
Get money, being broke is a joke, homie it ain't funny[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Hey , yo
Guess who's bizack still hit a crack him off loads
Cocaine spit throat be the stove
Stay running on these tracks and the mic be the soles
Be cautious real spitters so you might get exposed
Copycats spitting all these facts
Without your life attached not understanding where your life is at
You got your boy confused though I'm not convinced
Would tell you washed up, but your flow is drenched
Let me clear my throat let me spit these quotes
And tell you Q, Jay Rock, Dot, we run the coast
I'm so addicted, and so is Lifted
So restricted, now your flow evicted
Fake niggas see through you like eyelashes
Eyeglasses like Kobe nigga, no passes
My breed, knowing that you can't make 'em
You can't break 'em, so peace As-salamu alaykum

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Goodbye, I know the rapper dead
I'm on my murder job again in the morning
This 187 on the line I know the rapper dead
That means another record label is mourning
So you can run but you cannot hide
Cause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
When I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
Mortician got a feeling with embalming fluid
Cause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
When I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
Lyrical homicide best believe I do
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yo Q, these niggas think they cute
Talking louder than the trumpet, when I see 'em where the fluke?
Your opinion something moving like pew pass by 'em, hog tie 'em For the revenue, bullets peer through the bulletproof
Look what the iron do scope now I'm eyeing you
Silencer, now my iron grew I en route
Learn, of the flow first to realize these rap guys
Shit on 'em then throw them to the flies bombs like Al-Ca-ter
Ride on my enemies, homicide
Text like a referee, give you free shot for any penalty
Drop metaphors, nouns and verbs plenty similes
Serve like a waitress and you don't want seconds courtesy
Off K Dot, the son of 2Pac
Biggies nephew Big L said I was special
Now let's do, lunch over these beats
Even Punch said I was sweet
Punchlines and kick hot rhymes 'till I'm burning my feet
Ouch

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Goodbye, I know the rapper dead
I'm on my murder job again in the morning
This 187 on the line I know the rapper dead
That means another record label is mourning
So you can run but you cannot hide
Cause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
When I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
Mortician got a feeling with embalming fluid
Cause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
When I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
Lyrical homicide best believe I do
[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q ]
Wait I got it uh known for spitting knowledge uh
Homages like tuition, they pay it like it's college uh
Wait professor uh, well how I spit it this semester
Look I'm sending MC's on a stretcher
These bitches uh, all because my lyrical conversation
Got these bitches begging for penetration
Humiliation, Rappers they will know I demolish ya
Spit you to a coma Dot finish 'em

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar ]
Uh, wait, Diminish ya preach like a ministerCompetition naw they pussy get the [?]
Get in the ass like animals imitators get plenty of
Propane, hotter when winter come, some insane
Dope mane, bee's the studio, You ain't lived here
Ever since I done came, record me yoooo
Your own momma wouldn't do that
She rather throw herself in the dumpster than listen to trash[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
Have you ever ever ever been depressed so bad
It was a struggle every day not to regret your past
Feeling cursed like you never ever get your swag
And you was speeding down the highway when your threshold pass
When you cried all your tears out
And one page of your diary can tell you what your year ’bout
That’s a lonely place
My mama said “Son, why such a lonely face?”
Because the pressure’s on me
Plus I feel like Bill Murray trapped in Punxsutawney
Dr. Phil told me that I can sell crack or hit the army
Look at where we live at
Tell me you don’t hear that
Tell me you don’t feel that
Show me to the way out
Tell me when pastor Raphael gon’ reveal that
If not, man I’m outta here
I’m just a sleep walking robot that’s outta gear
I stick my nose out the water to the sky for air
Lama sabachthani
I’m trying to see light but the devil trying to blind me
The grim reaper walking with his shovel right behind me
Trying to introduce me to the untimely unkindly
I Walk the line finely like Johnny Cash
But I keep getting visits from the ghost of the past
So I spark another L then I go to the pad
[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I’m a thinker not a drinker but still I hennessy drag
Alcohol numbs the pain like with novacane stabs
In your arteries pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on em
Colors corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted crip & piru’s cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Qur’an can save
Welcome don’t be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
Stare at the sky wonder will you live to see 25?
I’m 22 at 20 I knew I was against the odds
This kid named Jonathan was monitorin’
His momma & sister, his older cousin he honoured him
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishin’
To Johnny he might have been a modern day rider then
He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a mac 11, now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what’s his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he’s from and thats one
More gangster under the family tree, took em under his wings like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching t-shirts that says “the hood made me”
No love just spread slugs thats the policy, the leader and the prodigy
Now shorty do-wap, holdin a ou-wap, hanging with rah rah’s with blah blah’s
That sit on the block catching fades, hitting licks, going on missions with lunatics
A 9th grade menace thugging for 6 months, smoking like 6 blunts
An hour the power of banging, he was walking… *3 Gun Shots*
Little Johnny
[Outro: Malcolm X]
I think you’ll find, sir, that there will come a time
When black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
As other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
And this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
And then at that point you’ll have a situation
Where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
And this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
And this type of thinking also will bring an end
To the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
It’s something that the black man has to bring an end to[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I rather die on my mother fucking feet 'fore a nigga live on his knees
Twin Glocks in my palm back against the wall I'm ready for war
My enemies die slow when I ride screaming THUG LIFE pistol in the sky
Remember me as a real nigga when I go
The Hennessy got me riding dirty with my crew, nigga M-O-B
Pussy ass niggas better duck they tails
Niggas can hide when my squad bail nigga we ballin
Alizé and weed keept on callin' gotta get some more
Intoxicated got almost had me falling lemme hit the floor
World Wide MOB figures I bet you all of my niggas ready to die nigga
Can you feel me? World Wide MOB Figure
Don't even wear yo strap if you ain't ready to die nigga
My attitude like fuck it middle finger towards the public
Bringing buckets to all my adversaries and I love it
My momma stress every night telling me to slow down
I said "Momma I'm in too deep ain't no turning back now"
Cause the niggas from the other side they want me dead
Catch me slipping roll up on me put a hole in my head
And the chronic just to got me even more paranoid
Looking out the window if they coming I'm ready for 'em
Just remember 2Pacalypse never ran from 'em
Ran to 'em eyes open with both guns dump'n
And till then tell them mother fuckers to strap up
Guns blazing when they act up
[Hook]
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I move way different than I used to
Eyes in back of my head everything bulletproof
Walking out the house cautious
Circle round the block twice before my car park it
My allies despise my success so they got me watching my every step
No exaggeration I know I can feel the reapers breath
Hovering over me like a helicopter or a 747 on autopilot
All of my problems dissolve once I take control of my own destiny
Hop on my murder chart overcome the odds
This goes out to all my dogs
Just holler if you hear me like a charger made by dodge made by dodge
Just ask Pac what it's like to be ready every night
AK-47 by the window aiming at car lights
For Makaveli the Mac is ready to explode
On any mother fucker who curse his soul
Death around the corner

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I saw him near last week
In my Oldsmobile some niggas try to blast me
So I cocked back the 4-5 no lie
Let my trigger finger fly like Nigga Nigga die
Close call player haters wanna see me fall
I shows no mercy you better be ready for war
Fuck the law should I ride on my own two
No crew just see what this Mac-11 gon do
Plenty bodies gon be dropping soon as I come through
Hop out let it rip head slugs go threw
BOW-BOW-BOW-BOW sound of my melody
Murder murder kill kill what them voices be telling me
Ever since a baby a nigga was living crazy
Age 13 playing with heaters ready for beef like
You want it you can get it anyway that you want it
Hit yah block, parents get smoked fast like marijuana
I trust no one everyday I'm watching my back
It's a well known fact that I see death around the corner

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation
2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
Dedication
It's dedication, look

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, "You do a song with Nip, K. Dot, he a better Crip"
I said, "He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?"
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be, "Stay safe," now it's, "Stay dangerous"
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense, nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil', tour the world, dawg, my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
Dedication
It's dedication



[Intro: Dr. Dre & Anderson .Paak]
Where you from nigga?
(Help me!)

[Skit]
"What is going on in Compton? I don't understand it."
"Well as it relates to this, this is not in my field as the clerk so anything that relates to this, you'll probably have to get an answer from Dr. Dre."

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I heard you talking about respect, I gave you niggas the utmost
All you niggas the utmost
Would you look over Picasso's shoulder
And tell him about his brush strokes?
Them opinions, I don't trust those
I apologize, the city made a nigga so cutthroat
Every hood love me, but it started on one coast
Could've stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want more
I'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go

[Chorus: Justus & Dr. Dre]
(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
But I ain't been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton!)

[Bridge: Dr. Dre]
Psst! This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific (The Pacific), representin'
Where them sharks at nigga, down in the deep water

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Listen, listen, listen, all you niggas swimming in the info
Go fuck around and drown in the specifics
Always going overboard, used to be my kinfolk
Now you sleeping with the motherfuckin' fishes
(Swimming with the mothefuckin' fishes, what the business?)
These niggas won't let up until they all wet up
(Don't get it fucked up!) Naw, nigga!
Now everybody wanna visit tryna re-up that prescription
(That prescription, yep, yeah, re-up)
That's my nigga, watercolors couldn't even paint the picture
If they don't get the picture, fuck them
Yeah, drugs by the dozen
You might just wanna go and check the children
(You might just wanna check your fuckin' children)
I'm the one that got they ear
Ah, for many years, I been making parents live in fear
I just wanna make it clear: My influence run deep like the ocean

[Chorus: Justus & Dr. Dre]
(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
But I ain't been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton!)

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Feel's like you're drowning, don't you?
About a hundred miles down in that ocean
It's over, shoulda never jumped in
If you can't swim (If you can't swim, if you can't swim)
Oh my God, where's a lifeguard when you need one?

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
Mixin' that with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinking 'bout no rapping, I was juuging for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No policing me, I got the beast in me, I gotta holla
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner city bullet flyin' 'til that bitch on auto pilot
Ah, shit! I don't give a fuck about your whereabouts
All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body
When I catch ya walking out your parents house
(Don't get it fucked up!) Homie got fucked up
Tryna park his tour bus, not knowing what's what
Or who's who, living in the L.A. County zoo
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof!
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (Boom, boom, boom)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (Boom, boom, boom)
That's when I realized banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium

[Chorus: Justus & Dr. Dre]
(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
Been away from home all night long
(All they wanna know is: where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton)

[Bridge: Cheyenne Lavene]
This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific
Where them sharks at, nigga, down in the deep water

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
Help me
(Feels like you're drowning)
I'm drowning
Help me, help me, help me
Somebody help me
(Shoulda never jumped in
If you, if you can't swim)
Help me
Help me, help me, help me
I can't, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, help
(Where's a lifeguard when you need one?)
God, please, please help me, please
Please help me, please help...
Please help, please, please...



[Sample]
I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible
Because it will reveal to you why it is true
That’s whatever the mind can deceive and believe
The mind can achieve
Regardless of how many times you may have failed in the past
Or off day your aims and hopes may be

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best?
Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy
When she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

[Chorus 1: Ash Riser]
In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy awards as best dressed
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blastin'
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly braggin'
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area or carry the birds to VA
Let the Clipse distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks flip three to six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a trump
Donald that is

[Chorus 2: Ash Riser & Kendrick Lamar]
In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
(And when I do I do it again
Then I go back
When I do I do it again
Then I go back
Thug it out)
Go out and get it
(But for now I'mma go head and doug it out
I gotta rhyme, rhyme)
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get to get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and my wife
Pops engine in this old school run tiiight!
But as you listening to K-D-O-T
Man, me and my girl split the bucket of KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say is "Damn
These niggas that much better than me, baby?"
I don't think this is meant to be
Cause I'm always losing self esteem
She paused the iPhone then said, "Huh?"
I repeated what I said then she replied, "Shut up."
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success, I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way

[Hook: 1]

Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Verse 1]
Look inside the eyes of a broke nigga
See the stress on his face
Look at his heart, ain't no love in the place
What's on his mind? - murder, money and mayhem
If he don't see a dollar somebody visiting Satan
He grabbed his gat from under the mattress, he cocked it back
Then grabbed his gloves and a mask, then threw on his hat
Looked in the mirror and said, "times is hard"
So hard that he got gray hair on his balls - pause
In the ghetto, you destined to fall
That's why it's a must that we ball
That's why he on the corner lurkin', waitin' for a mothafucka to slip
Soon as he see the chance, he takin' a risk
What should you do, when this nigga snatch you out of your whip
Empty out your pockets then snatch what's on your neck and your wrist---NOTHING!
Cuz when the gat in ya mouth, so speechless
Any false move and ya brains on the CE-ment
It gets gutter, when niggas starvin'
Niggas will run inside ya house, kill you on target--heartless
This is way beyond a cold thriller
This the diary of a broke nigga

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Giddy]
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the ground
Give me whatever you got right now
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the floor
Give me whatever you got plus more
When times is hard and I'm prayin' for change
My funds is low when I need some change
WOP WOP
Make sure you hide your goods when I come mista
You dealin' with the diary of a broke nigga
[Verse 2]
It's been a whole month he still ain't see no paper
Nigga losin' weight every time that he wake up
Plus, he tired of askin' niggas for favors
Cuz when they got mad they throw it back in his face
That's foul, flagrant this nigga been slavin'
In the spot all week still ain't see no paper, that's fucked up
They say don't bite the hand that feeds you but if that hand don't feed you where would that leave you?
Now that the stress come
Can't turn back the hands of time
Got him thinkin' back on what he should've done
First thing on his mind now get a gun
Shit you gotta eat, and you got a son
And a daughter, now that's two mouths to feed
And that money seems far like miles to reach
But it's right there
But his brain clouded
Life on the wrong road can't reroute it
Caught the nigga, and showed him what that heater do
If you don't feed your wolves your wolves eat you
This is way beyond a cold thriller
This the diary of a broke nigga

[Intro, Young Thug and Kendrick Lamar]

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm-
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Verse 1]

Girl, goddamn you were fine
I told a joke and you laughed every time
I would have given every penny and every dime
Just live in my dreams of you being mine
But every time I got closе to it, you just made me feel like shit
You know I would nеver call you a bitch
But I know your love was all a trick
When I told you how I loved you so much, you just said, “fuck it, it ain't worth that much”
Never did I not give you any trust
Never did I say, “I really don't give fuck”
Girl you were so fucking smart and pretty
But damn, you were good at making a nigga feel shitty
I loved you and I showed you but you showed no pity
Everyday I still think about you, and all the love I had for you
Still thinking about how much I wanted you to be my boo
Still wishing you would ride with me in the Supra coupe
Waking up in a sweat after dreaming about me and you
I haven’t seen you for years and it feels like we was fucking yesterday
Feeling hope knowing there's no way we’ll be together someday
I would even cop you that new mid-engined Chevrolet, yeah
I know I don’t have a say yeah, but I wouldn’t give a fuck if you had a nigga I would fuck you anyway yeah
[Chorus]

Wishing I could go back in time, yeah yeah
When I had the chance of you being mine, yeah yeah
Had no other bitch in line, yeah yeah
Would have never replaced you, your too sublime, yeah yeah
Wish I had that DMC-12, so I could see when we was feeling ourselves, yeah
I lost you I lost my health, I lost you, could give two fucks about my wealth, yeah
Tried to stop thinking about you, you had me way to compelled, yeah
You had me to scared to find new love, and had me hating love itself, yeah

[Verse 2]

I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t even count some motherfucking sheep
I loved to hold you but that's just me, baby that's just me, yeah
I gave you my heart and you threw it in the sea, in the sea, yeah
Was surprised you loved me so much cause I was so street, so street, yeah
I couldn’t even fucking understand, the more I knew you my heart would expand
Baby girl, baby girl, I thought our love was so grand, but you had me slipping on loose surfaces like sand
Niggas couldn’t understand cause you weren’t in high demand, but I knew I would follow your every commad
I fucked it up, put my life in your hands, and that's how the greatest love couple had to disband, yeah

[Chorus]

Wishing I could go back in time, yeah yeah
When I had the chance of you being mine, yeah yeah
Had no other bitch in line, yeah yeah
Would have never replaced you, your too sublime, yeah yeah
Wish I had that DMC-12, so I could see when we was feeling ourselves, yeah
I lost you I lost my health, I lost you, could give two fucks about my wealth, yeah
Tried to stop thinking about you, you had me way to compelled, yeah
You had me to scared to find new love, and had me hating love itself, yeah
[Verse 3]

And I just need to let you know
That I would never switch you up for a ho
Used to take you for rides in my Nismo
Your friends used to think of me so low
Yeah, I try everyday not to look back but
The thought of life without you gives me a heart attack
Would rather just throw myself in front of a Mack
Don’t even feel the will to pull up on a nigga with the gat
Yeah sit so far back in the Maybach, not Caddilac
Just to fucking trap, had to get the bag
Joel Embiid baby, shake the rack
But ultimately without you don’t even fucking want a snack
Your the only reason I have a will to write these raps
Your the only reason I can set lap records at the track
Your the only reason I’m finna cop that Mercedes CL Black
In case you haven’t noticed I’ll always want you back, Hesitation

[Chorus]

Wishing I could go back in time, yeah yeah
When I had the chance of you being mine, yeah yeah
Had no other bitch in line, yeah yeah
Would have never replaced you, your too sublime, yeah yeah
Wish I had that DMC-12, so I could see when we was feeling ourselves, yeah
I lost you I lost my health, I lost you, could give two fucks about my wealth, yeah
Tried to stop thinking about you, you had me way to compelled, yeah
You had me to scared to find new love, and had me hating love itself, yeah

Got the MAC, got the Regal
Fuck it let's go pull up on this nigga
Finish the job, amen brotha[Verse 1]
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA
[Video Outro]

I got i got i got
Motivation realization in my DNA
I got
Devotion and emotion in my DNA
Eyes open wide
Yeah we only want the prize
Standing ovation and celebration for our DNA



[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yo, this ya man Wiz Khalifa, yo LA Leakers, where the fuck did y’all find this one?
I had that one zipped up with the good shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world
So I tell a disc jockey “press play” while I press up on a girl
In the midst of the smoke in the air
The reflection of lights that glare
She’ll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare
And that’s power steering, a power trip will see my appearance
Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon
Speakers bumpin’, drinks is pouring
We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus
That’s real big, pop my collar, pop that lid

[Chorus: Terrace Martin]
Flashin’ lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we’ll do this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
We’ll do this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
Smoke like this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
We’ll do this 'til the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Some people stay home and sleep, me I go out at night
All seven days of the week, I live the party life
I got my dogs with me, you can bring some of your friends
We going hard 'til the sun come up and do it again
I got a drink in my hand they playing my favorite song
This girl that’s dancing on me ain't got no panties on
And she gonna come back to my hotel, don’t tell
Anyone about us, I’m here to party all night

[Chorus: Terrace Martin]
Flashin’ lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we’ll do this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
We’ll do this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
Smoke like this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
We’ll do this 'til the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again

Come to my section (my section)
And down some of this liquor
Then tell me what it hit for
Gon' be some things I don’t remember
So take some camera phone pictures

Come to my section (my section)
And down some of this liquor
Then tell me what it hit for
Gon' be some things I don’t remember

[Chorus: Terrace Martin]
Flashin’ lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we’ll do this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
We’ll do this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
Smoke like this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
We’ll do this 'til the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again

Waiting for the kids
School bus to arrive
Oh, but you know, they're gonna do it anyway
Reaching for your keys
Wait, is that your phone?
Got a TBI
Wait, is that police?
Get out for what?
I'm not your guy

You better duck, run fast from the mania
Don't stare, don't laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya'
Don't let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up, and they'll shoot ya'
Face off, face off Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same law
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion
Watch em' close enough
Don't let the holster break or roast ya'
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon' switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner?
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!

Woman arrested for gettin' naked

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Barrel straight through the peephole
Tell your parents that we home
Propaganda that we own
Crime infested, not contested
Block conventions and street zones
My redemption won't be long (woman)
My religion, fear no man (arrested)
Warrior, Conan, oh man (for gettin')
Horror stories and romance (naked)
Devils that like to slow dance
Kettles burnin' with sin in them
Children don't wanna hold hands
Tourists don't wanna visit and purists die in the maulin'
Fire burnin' through skylines
Follow fortune through guidelines
Bloody Jordans and Popeye's
Stolen Porsches and baby abortions at an all-time high
More divorces and child support lawyers, callin' you, "Dada"
Feds tap on your wifi (skrrt)
Meds makin' you crazy, you dip your head in some agua
Hit the dip while you're drinkin' it
Fuck it, flip on the stop sign
Duck a clip in that drive-by
Fuck a bitch in the Honda
Sell a brick to a minor
Makin' wishes for Jannah
Pump your fist up far higher
Reminiscin' bout Zion
Tigers, bears and lions in every jungle that I am
Welcome to America's future, the great ruler (woman)
Public Enemy's first born, ready to shoot you

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment

[Verse 1: Yung Nuts]
Don't piss on my nachos
I'll shit in your hand!
Your dick on my nachos
I see it expand!
My nachos so good
All cheesy and gooey
So yummy you'd think they were made by Rattouille
These nachos the funniest youve ever seen
Cum on my nachos and taste the cream!
AAAAAAAHHAHHAHHH

Don't piss on my nachos!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH[Verse 1]
His eyes bloodshot red
I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother
Reminiscin' on them playing Sega with each other
He was hurtin', I could see it, plenty tears, no Kleenex
I stood by his side because that was my homie
Gave him a hug, some of his brother's blood got on me
Clinchin' his fist on some angry shit
Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin' with
I wasn't sure, so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
Revenge, what do you say to a good friend
That just lost it and grabbin' choppers out of the closet?
I tried my best to make him re-neg
But he was like, "My nig, this feelin' is more than personal"
I stood down
He hopped in a four-door Honda Accord
Before he bent the block, he said, "K-Dot...
"...You wouldn't understand"

[Chorus]
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
Or, at least, try to understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
[Verse 2]
Corners become monuments for the dead
Candles on the pavement, postcard read
Rest in peace, the yellow tape blockin' off the streets
A baby mama yellin' at the police
But you don't understand
You figure that we're just a bunch of niggas but the picture here's a story untold
See, this wasn't in our plans
Babies from the late '80s wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way
Put that Malcom X book down, then raise that K
Complete chaos when we off X pills and St. Ides
Look the devil in the face, from a sane eye
Cast the spell on you like Akeelah and the Bee
Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted mind
Substance, time, is no longer an issue
We don't have it, so pass the tissue
Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
And tell her you understand, but you don't understand

[Chorus]
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
And, hopefully, you'll understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
[Verse 3]
He came back fifteen minutes later
He said, "Dot, I went on one, do me this favor
Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
This as critical as it gets, my nigga, I need you"
I said, "Alright, so what happened?"
"Seen a few niggas slippin' and I just started clappin'
I didn't care who I was hittin'"
That's wild shit, but anyway, I got you
I love you nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
I woke up the next mornin' with a cold
Allergies got me sneezin' and wipin' my nose when it was leaking
Checked the medicine cabinet, lookin' for some DayQuil
But all I seen was some Aspirin, s'just my luck
I got up, went to Rite-Aid
Hopin' that the pharmacy department had the right aid
I bought it and left
Walked to the parking lot, that's when I seen the faces of death
Said they was lookin' for my man, with a chopper in they hand
Prayin' it would jam, but you don't understand

[Chorus]
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
I'm tellin' you, do you understand?
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s)
Huh? Do you understand?
(The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
[Outro]
It's like
It's a revolving door

And every time I go out, yeah

Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

Heart pumping, novacaine
Speed through the motor lane
Race to your doorstep, feign for the short thing

Get you then I pin you to the post on your bed, ayy

Told me that you got a new love but I...

The way I used to love you, oh (The way I used to love you)

Wasted (Wasted)
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby every place I go reminds me of you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

And every time I go out, yeah

Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

No more “please stop”
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, woah

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
And I never came down from the last time
But that don't mean nothing, niggas still climbing
Bitches popping bottles and they sipping pink diamonds
I took a break from the game and I seen these niggas clowning
The blogs wouldn't be the same if you took Spitta out it
Props to the ones who instrumentally getting me popping
Balling without first learning the fundamentals, forget about it
Tryna 360 up the middle, you ain't even learn to dribble
Twiddling my thumbs smoking lime
Watching hamster ass rappers running wheels going nowhere with their rhymes
Stuck, Glenn Robinson big dog bus, socks up, top down, killing squares, riding around
Coolest nigga in yo city, even when I'm not in town
Smoking like I signed for 50 million and I'm underground
Yeah, uh
Smoking like I signed for 50 million still underground

[Verse 2: J-Lie]
And who we are, flow away above all, see
If I didn't rap I still look like a star, just admit, you know
You can spot me from afar, no big diamond chain that was so old for
Just a mention going up, it's nothing that I fire
Put the ladies sleeping over, slumber parties every night
Get your flights from … sending me all over
Bring me to the club, cause all the bitches like
What other rapper you know can call from Dakota, anger ...and call from a favor
And Brooklyn and Queens cause they got I'm a king
Avoiding tattoos, ...take the music …
My kicks so is fresh no scuffs from the ground, this nigga's too fly, can't get scuffs from the clouds
This ain't even my city but shit might as well, that's why me and spitta sold out ATL

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Jet setter, I've been iller, causing vendettas with all of you Ben Stillers
These little fuckers hate my endeavors, time for men sweaters under chinchillas
Trend setter, kick killer my feet wear caskets
Fresh to death and rare glasses, the bomb bottles, rose petals and Ford models
Who all follow my Twitter and still sword swallow
DM me, got him in the frenzy, it's all about the benjies
I'm feeling like the kembe, block haters stop player I'm so clean
My pockets love the earth baby they go green
Sitting back in that cold thing, wanna rock the mic but she don't sing
Messing with the flow king, kiss the gold ring, pucker up buttercup, or knuckle up to these punch lines that uppercut

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Chillin in my teepee, no indian but he be
The realest shit I must admit I'm baskin in my feces
My style is harder, yours is watered down they call it fiji
The bible or my CD, both of them were said to be the
Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill
House party with killers, pray for Italy villas
Where accents think it's Buffy and chandeliers hang from ceilings
I'm dreaming, I'm scheming to be major
Compose art like a Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus, today is
The day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain
The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
Paper bout the forest tree, acres of that THC
I don't smoke but homies do, find the cloud and have a seat
And I wonder how ... live to see 80
I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes



[Verse 1: SZA]
Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more, you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come with me, Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy, y'know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me, hey, ayy, hey

[Chorus: SZA]
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
You are now watching MADtv

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it—pussy
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it—pussy
Double back handicap and go blind for it—pussy
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculating and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth

[Verse 3: SZA]
You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
High key, your *beep* is weak buddy
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you
I think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA)
I'm really tryna crack off on the headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
'Cause if you that for me

[Bridge]
Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy, like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind

[Chorus 2]
I will make you beg for it
I wanna see you crawl
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
I'll give you all of me and I won't stop, not a little bit
(Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride)
Make you beg for it, I wanted to do it all
(Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why)
Unfortunately you couldn't get your shit together
(Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride)
(Ride, ride, ride, ride)
You are now watching MADtv

[Skit: Mommy]
We take things, and my influence so far, and then it's out of my hands. And, y'know, while as I said it can be scary, it can also be a little bit comforting. Because I've learned that when I get to that point, and I can acknowledge, "Okay, Audrey, that's as much as you can do," I can actually let it go...

They want an explanation, but pigs, I don’t speak to
Nuclear bombs, we’re making the most noise
Boys in the hood, I’mma do ‘em like Doughboy
Go, here comes the sirens
Block is hot as the irons
Swerving on Avalon
I’m reppin’ the deuce like Bobby Johnson
Glocks shoot ‘em like murder
Got both of ‘em like Kirk
Come deep like we on some buckets
Ride through with no interruptions
From your head to your waist, they do it in every city
With my Chucks and my Dickies I’m on Ciroc like I’m Diddy
Aim for his head, knock him right on his Cortez
Not only a dance it’s your regular program

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I’mma do my gudda like it’s my bread and butter
Hit my nigga, on his cell, oh little L that’s my brother
Tell me that a female wanna fuck with the K-Dot
Eat it up, then beat it up, my MO baby, may I?
Two times, I do mines, I knew mines, I do fine
I keep bread and croutons, we bust heads then move on
What’s happenin’? I’m bagging through a bitch and gettin' richer
Bought some toys for the kids, bought a chopper for my nigga, yup
And I’m jiggin’ in the function, I throw my arms up with my index finger pumpin’
A brand new dance coming straight up out of Compton
Little K-Dot from the A-block and I’m Rosecrans thuggin’ huh

[Verse 4: YG]
(Guns shots) Ayy, thats how I sound when I get off
Tree top Bompton, hold on let me get my shit off
Strapped, hope I don’t get caught, hold up, let me shit talk
The 745 and Rosecrans had them pissed off
My gudda keep a slug and a clip that holds numbers
‘Cause I be in the Porsche riding through the bity all summer
Ducking from the under covers on my second level
Still in the streets now because of half you muthafuckas (ay)
Fronting with the Chuck T’s
[This my creed, this my steez nigga on P's]
Ninth grade at Paramount High I was fucking edgy
Socking out any motherfucker that couldn’t stand me

[Spoken Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
Cus' we ain't gonna win
Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen
(shit)
Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Struggle that is
I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
That means what I'm thinking is right
Punch, loop the beat for a minute
Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home
Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon
Wait a minute K. Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back
If dreams was reality
If it was cool for you to be a casualty
The only way that you can escape poverty
Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time
You're listening too far if you hear this part
I suggest you go back and press rewind
I fast forward to common thoughts of a human
Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint
Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix
Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it
Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
Direct them to a casket
Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...
If they wanna see reality [haha]
I'm losing you again ain't I?
Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?
Black President, they don't wanna see that
It's evident...pain is pain
We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness
I swear to God that we live in a Matrix
Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships
Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best
Bring each other down, crab in a bucket effect
We learn to live with it I guess
I mean die with it, since we're already dead
Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time
Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down
Teach you about the things that we live around
Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...

[Verse 2: Punch]
What if dreams was reality and money was love
What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity
Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity
Traveling, no direction, the aimless casualty
American dream or Scarface fantasy
Kilos of coke and the arms of black families
We use to it, our hearts draped in stone
A mother's dreams for her baby boy to come back home
Cus' he out pushin' that chrome, pursuing that cash
End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast
Now another mother screams picking out his casket
Harsh reality, it seems like it's simple mathematics, it's not
It's trigonometry (trigganometry) divided by some real life
And he'll do it again just to get a mill' twice
The streets mowed him, can't make past that
It's not a dream it's reality, look where it's at [ugh]
What happened in Manhattan happens all the time
In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime
No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness
I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president
World trade happened on the world stage
Same stage look at us as some educated apes
On video stations women gyrating
Parading around, mind-raping the youth
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway

[Outro: Denzel Washington]
I'm the man up in this piece! You'll never see the light of da..
Who the fuck d'ya think you fuckin' with? I'm the police!
I run shit here, you just live here!



[Intro]
Dreams
Keep dreaming
Cause I don't know
How to complete it

Sun
Keeps shining
And making a glisten
From the tears I'm crying

We have nothing to fear
But fear itself
We're not forced to love
But let's love ourself

Start here first
Then to the world
Life too short, enjoy yourself
Don't be scared to ask for help

[Chorus]
Pave the way
To a light day
Find the right way
To your bright estate

[Verse 1]
There's so much I someday wanna do
So much I wanna try & prove
I'm honestly not one to go & brag
But there's really so much I have

To offer to ya'll
My creative ideas can fill a whole mall
But I'll make my prices cheap
But the ideas deep

Everything I make has a message
And I try not to teach ya'll a lesson
You do you
You stay true

I wish I learned that earlier
Good thing I was told by a little bird
Now I can sleep at night
And accept my non-normal life

[Chorus]
Pave the way
To a light day
Find the right way
To your bright estate

[Verse 2]
Anxiety gets the best of me
Like North Korea could bomb us any week
And our final moments are us turning to debris
That's something I'm afraid to see

I wanna be in the generation like Kylie
And not fitting in with Abercrombie
I'm trying be free
And not drowned in a sea of people thirsty

For attention
What a weird dimension
That we all now living in
Was this the intention?

Might need an intervention
To see inside these walls
And see them having withdrawals
From one once was

[Chorus]
Pave the way
To a light day
Find the right way
To your bright estate

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm a nice dude (Okay), livin' my life dude (Ugh)
Trick on a dumb bitch is nothin' I might do (Nope)
Some try to play fools, the shots that they fake shoot
I'm mean like a Red Bull is mean when the eighth pull
I'm faithful to whatever I stand for
It means dough, gettin' my pesos
Gecko or Geico, whatever it stand for (Ha)
Red and blue flags, yours are like a rainbow, ha
Pants hang low
Born with the best flow since LL was rockin' a Kangol (Woo)
'87, one man, eighty weapons
I go hard without usin' protection
Hard out, learn your lesson
When I pull out, make like R. Kelly, get to steppin', haha
I'm the best at this profession
I can't help but bring it back to the essence mothafuckas

[Verse 2: DJ Dave]
I'm a young dude, smoke the best weed
See the act right, see them dubs clean
A sexy bachelor, hit 'em in your strokes
Never bust a nigga, goin' down your throat
The Phantom, not rich enough to cop yet
But picture [?] for the niggas outta pocket
I can exercise you, you can get a [?]
When I lean back, don't dance, give me [?]
Killa got that heat, we know killas in the street
With the heat that make you feel like a fat boy at the beach
So don't try to run up on [?] talkin' all that [?] and shit
I can rhyme and shit
If you niggas pay attention, you won't ask me shit
You should think about it, take a second, one
Matter of fact, you should take four b
Think before you fuck with real killas in the street

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm from a small city, no pity shown 'cept hammers thrown
Quickly push back your dome like a hot comb
So swiftly, come get me
If I had every bitch in the world, boy, you still ain't fuckin' with me
I'm 'bout my money strictly, as long as I stack my banks up
I'll have enough Young Bucks to fuck with 50
Now who fuckin' with me? Me and that gun was born siamese twins
So where I move, it's comin' with me
You down right, play with me, think I won't take your life
The scope'll have more dots on you than a website
I'm 'bout my head right and yours left
I swear in the vocal booth is where I'll take my last breath
That's K-Dot, oh you ain't heard? Shit, that boy hot
With dime bitches runnin' on beaches like baywatch
You sit and watch the young child with my money stacks
Add up faster than cell phones on speed dial

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
For my niggas that hate the fights
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
Get it with the Glocks
For my niggas that hustle nights

Bakin' with the pots
For my niggas that know right

See my game still the same, never trick on a bitch
You don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, DJ talking]
(Work out for me, work out for me)
(Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse One: Kendrick Lamar]
Feeling like a mother fucking animal
Hannibal Lecter of 2012
Elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
If music is your calling
You're falling, pick up yourself
If a nigga said he could see me
Bet he told you in Braille, fucker
Put you in front of the street then buy you some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldn't bare my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swinging swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan
Watch they face drop when the beat drop
I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool
Me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin
Stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting
No judgement for a plaintiff
They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B
But I've been O.D. since '03
That's March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like sweet chin
Music on Chuck Norris

[DJ Talking]

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Look, look, look
I'm J-A-Y, Rock to be exact
Niggas said gardens, Watts on the map
Hm, story of this eastside nigga
All my life in the ghetto on the peace side nigga
Where across the tracks, opposites attract
Niggas go hard for the color of they flag
Dope man money, welfare recipients
Unfit mothers never heard of obedience
Ho's so devious, niggas all talk
Right around the corner, deja vu
Same old shit, something like re-runs
Gotta stay sharp, if you slip then you bleed ?
Guns in the Levis, 501s
Niggas don't box, they buy more guns
Uh, that's how it is on these L.A. streets
Don't sleep, don't sleep
Look, catch me sitting in my truck
Remy in this cup
No tags on this bitch, but I don't give a fuck
I ride until the wheels fall off
That's some real shit
Never let them get in your mind, never reveal shit
Let a nigga know your feelings, business and all
He's the type of nigga riffing and wishing on you to fall
Fake niggas try and impersonate your character
That's why I got my mother's fucking eyes on them scavengers
Watch 'em!
My daddy told me that every day
Pray for late Charles, why he have to pass away?
Thinking about my pops, then the stress starts to kick in
Roll me up a fat ass blunt and start drinking
Damn!
Then reality starts to set in
I'm married to the streets and I ain't never had a wedding
I stop selling dope because niggas started telling
Sex, money, and weed: the life we start living
Guns in the closet for niggas who start tripping
Stay in the house when them choppers come out spitting
Stay on your job
Keep your eyes open on every corner
The blink of an eye, and you're a goner
No wronger, tell 'em about the pains of this hunger
Shock 'em like thunder
And the ? going bonkers
Just living my life up on some cool shit
So, nigga just miss me with all that bull shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm whatever the streets made, the saint
The renegade the chain on the timid slaves
The dead on the corner, the van of the coroner
The ambulance first-aid, the criminals crime wave
The dominate at point guard, the drugs on the schoolyard
The kid on the go-cart, the bucket that won't start
The ruckus that won't stop, the city that hate cops
The niggas that's fed up, shoot and shake cops
The obstacle war block, the feeling of victory
The friend, the enemy, the positive energy
The negative force that forces you to sip Hennessy
And sin like a sinner that exempts all sympathy
The churches that God built, the verses that I killed
The curse that the devil gave, the start of the end of days
The happy and afraid, they dap me and give me praise
But we're nothing alike, see I am life, motherfucker

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
And everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
It's a few things you won't understand
And so I say comprehend the best you can
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
[Verse 2: Blue, The Misfit]
I'm the seven-headed monster brought on by revelations
The evil conscience temptation that makes you wanna start hatin'
The fallen angel mistaken, now you think that he Satan
The reservation I'm dating, the devil infatuating
I am the groupie that knew she liked to go fight with her parents
Now it's loosely apparent that she gets loose, now a parent
I am that child support that says nah, nigga, you stuck
You should've never have fucked, lost money over a nut
Her pussy came in the clutch, that VC wasn't enough
Her plan A was a A+, a plan B, never had one
I am the robber of the gun, I am mistakes, I am strife
Of course not, we're not alike, see, homie, I am life, motherfucker

[Hook: Blue, The Misfit]
And everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
It's a few things you won't understand
And so I say comprehend the best you can
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am[Intro]
This is the future, this is the future

[Chorus]
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Never had enough, pass me the mask, ayy
Are you down for me? Girl, been on my last, ayy
See the sirens pulling up, pigs on my ass, ayy
Even when the money come, gone way too fast, ayy
Why my grandma couldn't live? Gone way too fast, ayy
Cousin murdered in the field, gone way too fast, ayy
Got a liver full of 'yac, weed in the back, ayy
Got Cîroc for the hoes, chill on the stash, ayy
Uh, pass me the gas
488, stunt man, blast from the past
Got my damn trunk in the front, Top in the back, ayy
Hell yeah, nigga drunk, buzz if they ask, ayy
[Chorus]
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really... hold up

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Don't be worried, baby, this is what I does
Backstroke, looking for a quick flood
And you be lying when you say you want our love
Two cups in, and you already lookin' for love

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
You a cutie and lookin' purty and perfect
What you drinkin'? Feel amazing
Imagine, we get to thinking
I'll explore you and tour you and keep it cordial
She prestigious, the cleanest, I could be dreaming
Fuck my ex is a no-no
Did the love thing and it cost me, she crossed me
Let me work it, you feel your virgin in circles
The groovy Capo, I keep it nasty, attractive
Hit it backwards, do it faster and faster
This a classic
I done mastered the climax, you feel the pressure
Hit it over and over, we doing extra
I can stretch you and fold up
We get to mobbing, bottle popping
I'm stress-free, you gave me options
Life is best in the backseat, ayy
Sunshine give me light
Words ain't soundin' bright
Girl, come and spend a night, ayy
[Chorus]
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk (Woo)
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk

[Intro: Bēkon & Kid Capri]
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse

[Bridge: Ted Taylor (Sampled)]
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
[Gunshot]

[Verse 1]
I spaz out 'til I pass out
There’s clarity in my vulgarity for a sass-mouth
Your parody’s not funny
Apparently you ain't nothing but industry crash dummies
As long as the lord love me, I’m good
I could: be the best rapper but I’d rather be the answer that capture the violence that coincides in my hood
I should: stick a fork in this music business
But I’m too deep in it like pussy on my penis
Devil’s kitchen in Phoenix; that’s the heat that I’m bringing where the shade at?
I’m L.A. radio and good music, boy, I don’t play that
Ugh, Walking a thin line from thinking like Einstein
And rhyming like Rakim in ’89
Don’t wanna pack a nine just a mind full of wisdom
Like a man 99 years old locked in prison
Don’t freeload on my vision
Get exposed like an R&B ho with a sex tape hidden
I’m always for the business, forever you can feel it
Whether you Crip blue or a nigga that hemorrhage
My penmanship is like me and Langston combined to the hip
And my hip to the hop don’t stop as I rock
I got a buzz like a shot of Palmer Sun
And the women fall in love as they fall in my crotch
Now understand that I’m all that you’ve got
Give me chance, give me ears, give me hearts, give me props
Hear the difference? I’m cool like that
Oh, you spit? Well the retarded drool is back
See, I’m the author of the authors, the father of the Austin Power fajja
Who can bust like a charter, why bother?
I know a jealous serpent is a burden to my life
But still I carry on like luggage on a flight
The realness in my bones is the DNA to life
I can give you insight only if you’re in sight
I’m looking past y’all like a fastball - strike!
And I ain't even tryna give it my all - yikes!
I’m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a Huxtable
You couldn’t see my pedestal, because you’re afraid of heights
Cloud 9, where you can find
Me in my dime like Roosevelt in his prime
Wait 'til I’m in my prime
The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion
To whom say he cool: but the irony is I could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palm
I say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signs
It’s not all about punchlines, I don’t do that
I’m a Jaguar; you’re just a new cat, now move back
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
Aiming for the top like an AR aimed at your neck
I can never digress, ‘less I get demoted to death
Even then I’ll be the best still, like a petty theft
I will: conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings
Nipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head
But still they’ll feel me, cause we all ate cereal
Humped our momma's friend's daughter while they bump the stereo
Backflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the park
Watched Power Rangers after school; here we go
I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise
For no faulty ass A&R or CEO
We ain't what you think and you think we’re back
But we’ve been here for decades, and I vouch for that
Open your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over iChat
Get your other eye cracked
I don’t rap, I-Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watching enemies' blood pour
I came up lower middle class, not poor
So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me
I need y’all to feel me
And if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel free
My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
By the ultimate prize I'mma get when I see your suicide

[Intro: Jay Rock]
This shit is fresh out the oven
Fresh out the oven

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I'm back in this bitch, nigga you know what's up
Stackin' my dividends
Straight out that gutta so you know just what you dealin' with
Highly belligerent
But that's way before the liquor hits
Roll that kushy kushy, rub on her goodie goodies
Crush her so good, she all on my timeline now
Lookin', lookin', she tryna sabatoge my thing
Never go brazy when you're deep inside the pink
I'm lowkey like a drug dealer
So don't snitch, my nigga, get your chips, my nigga
Mind your business, I minds mine, let's get rich, my nigga
Take our family on trips, my nigga
But if you try me then your wig I'ma split, my nigga
And I ain't tryna kill my own kind
But we always losin' to the wrong place at the wrong time, no lie
And they wonder why us niggas always get high
Spend a thou-wow on it just to get fly
Another thou-wow on it just to get by
Fuck it, only got one life to live
Gotta push it to the limit, do it big like

[Hook: Jay Rock]
What? This shit is fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
It's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'
Just as long as you thuggin', yeah it's fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
It's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'
Just as long as you thuggin'
Big bank rolls, just as long as you thuggin'
Whip game cold, just as long as you thuggin'

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
I pull up and park, hop out and swag
Grab the Glock out the trunk, other Glock in the stash
Just a regular nigga, with no chains or nothin'
If I do get some shines, you try to snatch
There's repercussions, and concussions
You know what's after that, end of discussions
I came a long way from eatin' free lunches
From Mary County checks to makin' these numbers
Oh Lord, I'm just reminiscin'
Could it be some intervention on some inner vision?
I don't know, 'cause I'm just goin' with the flow
Whatever's required, I got it goin' for the low

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
Ah, I parted ways with my old self, I'm a new man
New face with a new stone and the blue van
Blew weight on a bad day with my loosie
Suitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan
This my new wave, this my new tan
This my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand
This my shakin' down you niggas' pockets, I don't do friends
And I don't do trends
Fuck it though I'll ride with you then!
Bring the troops in
I'll fuck around and let 'em loose then
We'll give 'em blues then
Oh fuck it, call me Bobby "Blue" Bland
Aye you a fool man
Ridin' by you, swervin' at the intersection
Baby come and get your blessin'
And she gon' fuck with this erection
I got somethin' good for all these hoes
She gotta want the Betty 'fore I call these hoes
Now if I paid for your dress and your perm
That means you an investment, bitch
I'ma need my dough in return

[Part II]

[Radio Interlude]
We reporting live from the 9 double 0-5-9 with my nigga Jay Rock and this is WTOP Radio and I'm your host DJ Turn-Up
I don't turn down nuttin' but my collar
I ain't turnin' down no money
And I ain't turnin' down no mothafuckin' fade
Now bitch if you're pushin' up the freak with your orangutan-lookin' ass, take some advice and bang SZA ya flat-foot bitch

[Verse 1: SZA]
Itchin' for a climax lasting past 11:30
Do you got it like that, do you really got it like that?
Itchin' for a purpose, I can't seem to scratch the surface
I ain't got it like that, do I really got it like that?
You keep talkin' 'bout time, I got none
You can find me where
The sun don't never end and the waves don't part
You don't pay enough of my rent, don't start
I got big dreams and you got quick scheme to get rich quickly
And I don't wanna waste another hour
Really need to take another shower
Dirty for you

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Now this that big shell fishscale
BMX on the ramp with the fishtail
Pegs on the front, we gon' get there
We 4 deep at a swapmeet, don't need a 5th wheel
This bitch steal whoever if situations get real
This that fresh out the bounty, bustin' knuckles
Get buckled if you ever try to knock the hustle
Show your hands, watch how I shuffle (No cuts)
And show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus
Rollin' up that boondock, some call it moon rock
Gotta keep that bass in my step, dope in a tube sock
Gotta do what I do to remain on
So all a nigga need is good love when I come home
Cause the baby's gotta eat, baby the rent's been due lately
And I just caught a hot one, I ain't tryna go too brazy
Fugazi, not me, me and my niggas not sweet
Give you thug passion, how you walkin' around knock-kneed
I'm the silver bullet movin' at top speed
Show you how to get it and get away with it scott free

[Intro: Jay Rock]
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this (hold up)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom, now I'm on top
Pocket full of guacamole in it, no lie
The windows on the Continental tinted cocaine colored, it's a dope ride
Them dope boys outside
Gangbangers, crack heads and hood rats
Drug paraphenelia inside that back pack
If you want it we got it, that's where them goods at
Nickerson Gardens, project parties
Chronic, Hennessey, dro, Bacardi
Guns, enemies that come through, spark them
Throw 'em in a dumpster; you loved one, you lost him
I don't dance I just boogie a lot
No dress code I just wear a hoodie a lot
White tee under that back against the wall
West coast rocking to the beat, now I'm telling y'all

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this (homie)
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Whatever you want to call it
For the weed heads or for the alcoholics
Now this can be some OG low-rider music
Or you could twist your fingers up and gangbang to it
(gangbang to it)

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Look, I know some bad ass bitches that go hard on it
Addicted to that sex, they be traveling in packs
They be off that X, and they'll let you fuck fast if you got some cess
I ain't gon lie about it
I ain't bullshitting, come to my block boy
Welcome to Hell's kitchen, we bring that heat to you
Too much of a real nigga not to see through you
Wet him like faucet, bullet sink through you
They speed through you, they eat through you
Two lullaby burners, let 'em sing to you
The harmony of it is pleasure to your ears
You got to love it (nah) you got to hate it
I got to be my hometown favourite
Watts representer, say hello to your mayor
Everybody put them Ws in the air
May I show you the plan I lay out
My disc will never play out, I tell y'all to
[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this (homie)
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Whatever you want to call it
For the weed heads or for the alcoholics
Now this can be some OG low-rider music
Or you could twist your fingers up and gangbang to it
(gangbang to it)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Swing your elbows and Taylors, the shell-toes
Kush blunts all in the air, I smell lows
Compton swap meets to freaks on Melrose
This is California, killers on them corners
From Long Beach to Inglewood, Hollywood
Back down, them gangsters will be on you
Block hot as a sauna, uh
We in the club, zonin', Patronin'
My knuckleheads roamin', they on and we on it
It's jerkin', poppin', brackin', whatever you want to call it
What's happenin', we smashin', crashin' your hood
My nigga what's good?
Staying sucker-free, just as well as you should
I pull up in that motherfuckin' big-ass truck
What the fuck? I'm on
Where your bitch? She gone with a real nigga
I hop up out that ho asking how you feel nigga
I press blood; throw your sets up!
[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this (homie)
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Whatever you want to call it
For the weed heads or for the alcoholics
Now this can be some OG low-rider music
Or you could twist your fingers up and gangbang to it
(gangbang to it)Verse 1 [Ab-Soul]
They found me under the sea, with three dollars and sixty cents
So why would it make any sense for me to not make any since
The curly head, black lipped kid
That works at Magic Disk, be on some shit
I take a stand then make you sit
You take a stand, and then you snitch
What part of the game is that huh?
Pardon my frame of mind, but if you get out of line, it'll be a disaster
I take trips and pass out the most
Monumental rapper, don't ever go toe to toe
With those who's over dosing, on the antidote
Effortless I wreck this shit
Ab-Soul-loutly definite
Bet your deficite, that you ain't testing it
I'm excellence on ecstasy
If you can fathom such a combo, off the Humboldt
Smellin' like I'm lightin' a pine cone
Feeling like my mind got caught in a cyclone
I should put a spell on you niggas, like a typo
TaeBeast, TDE, El Campo
Carson, K-I-N-G, Del amo

Verse 2 [Schoolboy Q]
Uh, sittin' in my homeboy's apartment
In them dirty halls, burner in my dirty draws.... watch it!
For the boys that want it all, just got into altercation at the mall
But niggas know my protocol, ready for my homicide
Put me in a position, to have my finger itchin'
Don't jump up in the game if you ain't ready for the kitchen
Cause best believe the stove hot, cooking up beef up in the box till my time stop
Barb wires and pig cops
Every door get into locks, phone ain't got no dial tone
Look up and the clouds gone, hungry and my childs gone
Solitary mind state, push ups help me stay straight
Noodles help maintain, reading helps me isolate
Troubles help me concentrate, enemies evacuate
Let me hyperventilate
Hoping that my girl'll still be on it and the mother fuckers call me in the mornin'
(Roll it up!)
Verse 3 [Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck that shit, I'mma blow it up
Fuck that shit, I'mma load it up
Dump that clip, like a movie script
Whether blood or crip, I don't give a fuck
I'mma live it up, my time is now
Time and time again, I got that sound
That'll drown, Titanic, in Atlantic's ocean
I'm hoping, that they both go down
Nigga please, nigga hand your bitch your keys
So she can push your humvee, to my place we can smoke your weed
Pray to god that I'm not god, MC bumped in your ipod
Simply I am the CyHi of Centennial High don't give me no tie
I ready made my business mine, dec-i-mals are definite
Deficate on music mates, and bet, I do it delicate-ly
Ignore your celiba-cy and then tell you fuck you
Aye what the fuck you want, my fucking dick, you fucking cunt
Get off my n-u-t, s, he yes, got that unorthodox flow
Niggas is trapped, they don't hold no wraps but they calling 5-0
Smash in a El Dorado, whip it straight, till the fender break
In the middle of the street, where the criminals be
While I blaze this heat from the Tae Beast.... tape
Kendrick Lamar

[Intro: Kid Capri & Kendrick Lamar]
New Kung Fu Kenny
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Y'all know, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go!
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D-O-T my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my Telegram like, "Be cautious!"
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know

[Chorus]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

[Verse 2]
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah
They never been ready, yeah, I know, yeah, know, yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow, yeah, the flow, yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option

[Chorus]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

[Bridge]
Damned if I do, if I don't (Yuh)
Goddamn us all if you won't (Yuh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way

[Verse 3]
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element



[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Well uhh yeah
This is Energetik
Big Scoob, E-40 and Kendrick Lamar
Kali Baby!

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooooh
I stay on my toes, never caught digging in my nose
With my [?] delivery
[?] flows
I'm old school like [?] Vaults
Hundred Thousand units sold independantly we call it Ghetto Gold
I'm allergic to suckas achoo like I got a cold
And I don't hang around bustas like you, you's a hoe
You's a cub, I'm lion!
Why y'all always be trynna throw rocks at a giant?
Let me rewind it and define it
Pay hommage to KRS-One, Criminal Minded
OG [?] desperado like the bike club
I'm almost finished with this jug
[?] out of my body [?] me and my nigga at once
Talking loud in the hotel lobby
[?] hella sloppy
My brain's hella clouded, BITCH!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, see it's all copasthetic
All the time they be like ''Nigga, where you headed?''
"To the bank, my nigga, I'm trynna get lettuce"
Do it quick, fast everything be energetik
Energetik, lightning speed
Couple bottles of juice is all I need
And it's all copasthetic
Do it quick fast everything be energetik

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Yeah, Big homie from the Show Me all you niggas know me
Run up on me, Nakatomi from the peperoni (Brrrrat)
Keep it on me lil homie, I ain't dinner time
Pump your brakes stop and think 'fore you fuck with mine
HOG niggas, HOG ways, get it always
From the burner to the [?] now I'm on the stage
Energetik, old nigga on the paper chase
Do it my way, fuck what you niggas say
[?] authentic boy, I come to get it
No mimic, no gimmick, causin' pandemic
Epidemic: I invented what your man winnin'
Spitting venom watch me kill him when the venom hit him
[?] Killer City reppin' for the Villies
Five Block, so you know I brought the Fifties with me
[?] got me actin' wild
Aggravated for the paper I be showing out

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, see it's all copasthetic
All the time they be like ''Nigga, where you headed?''
"To the bank, my nigga, I'm trynna get lettuce"
Do it quick, fast everything be energetik
Energetik, lightning speed
Couple bottles of juice is all I need
And it's all copasthetic
Do it quick fast everything be energetik

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, back on the block with it
Back when I had worn my cousin’s shoes with holes and socks in it
Eatin' top rhymin', walk to school with a prepaid cellular
Crackheads tried to sell me a stolen Sox fitted
I tend to look at my upbringing a lot different
From where I’m at I inform you like Armonax that I’m two levels of terrific
Ya dumb bitch
We in yo hood with the transmissons, ya dumb bitch. Yee!
See this is Compton at its best, your four-o
And I’m loco as an esé with a fo-loco
And I stay local, I’m from the soil
Come from the bottom like the earth’s oil
Meet your SIHI at the coffee table
All that tough talking just telling me you poyo
I’m a rare breed, high off life without a gram of weed
Kendrick Lamar, a block off palma leaves
Sip the same palmasa my uncle put me on
This is me!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, see it's all copasthetic
All the time they be like ''Nigga, where you headed?''
"To the bank, my nigga, I'm trynna get lettuce"
Do it quick, fast everything be energetik
Energetik, lightning speed
Couple bottles of juice is all I need
And it's all copasthetic
Do it quick fast everything be energetik



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the coolest nigga you know
Migrated from the North Pole when I was fo'
Infatuated with cartoons and G.I. Joes
'Till something more greater took a toll: life
Not really, more like white Air Nikes
Evidently, I had a fondness for material things
Ten years old trynna get a 10-K ring
I forgot it was for me when the phone ringed
Elementary girls callin' the house
Desiree and Cheryl mama end hustled what we talkin' about
I'm talkin' about the good old days when we walked without knowing that could be our last time walking out
Now we can't walk witout protection
Bein' on the defensive, life ills
This life will put you in a crazy world
Just by knowing crime will never cure
So I'm strapped like Girbaud jeans
I'd rather see the pen like I was bowling
Rather than death, walkin' on heavy steps
It's a great place, but I ain't ready for Heaven yet
So I told God put me at the back of the line
Matter fact yesterday, swear to God I ain't lyin'
Movin' at a turtle pace, cause the fast lane got a day one uncle with one in the brain
Got one in the chamber
Sixteen in the clip, my eyes fluttered with anger
Hip-hop trynna save my life
Give credit whenever it's due, the money touchin' the roof
Breakin' the ceiling, with that being I'm breakin' the loot
With my loved ones, life way too short, son

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Shoul is, gotta wake up
Like a bakery, I'm trynna get the cake up
Never know when the day come, so we live carefree
Party like it's 1999, cherry cherry breath that I breath
Materialistic things, it won't mean shit when you leave
I ain't lyin', a nigga miss the good old days
Sippin Kool-Aid, Mama let the OJs play
Nowadays, it seems like the end is near
Cause babies killin' babies like Brenda did
Use ya head, mess around lose ya wig
Age fifteen, shit, a nigga witnessed it
Walking home from school, just me and my team
Shots fired, I guess it wasn't meant for me
So I thank the man in the skies above for his blessings until a nigga rise above
I'm fly as a dog, more dope than a drug
On the microphone, lemme kick the verse for y'all
Hip-hop'll never die as long as we alive
Top Dawg E-N-T, haters don't even try
You don't wanna pay the price of a lyrical ass-whoopin', we'll let it fly
Watch your career go up in flames, let it fry
Watch it die, no get back, just sit back, enjoy the ride
Live like it's no tomorrow, enjoy life

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I'm still reflectin' on the death of
Mission of the better
Only one that's necessary for Sarah
See, ya'll can say whatever, but still it come together
I used to rip it down and let you sew it back together
Hip-hop forever, fuck 'em and whoever fed up
And I wish a hex on whoever met 'em
I'm obsessed with objection
And I'd probably blame Common for my resurrection
I used to love her too
So when I'm in the booth, we do what lovers do
But I ain't stingy, let my niggas get a piece of her too
Another piece and I'm through
Probably trynna peace up with you
Niggas got some believin' to do
It starts now



[Verse 1: Warren G]
Yeah give respect to the trigger finger
I’ve been pushed that line since grade school of fools
Since I touch down bitches they wanna fuck now
But they can’t get it she got ass with a nose like
Pippen, my Pimpin it ain't never scared
My Pimpin it ain't never scared
Got real estate over there and hustle over here
Dare a nigga try to take it he gonna fake it till he make it
Shawty break em like a bracelet that's real talk
Shit don’t you snitch if you get caught
You already know if you do then you dead
And now niggas in the hood trading cush for your baby mama throat
But suck it up bitch deal with it huh
Ain't no glitch in my computer
Bangin beats for the gudda paper planes no hookahs yeah
I'm the driver and the shooter and the taxi
I dare you motherfuckers get at me
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I dare you motherfuckers get at me
(But I take it real back to 1994 listen to me)

[Verse 2: Murs]
See I grow up with the blue team before there was a ustream
Seen a lot of niggas knocked out over shoe strings
Rhyming on these beats since the 90s I’m a factor
Here with this career until i’m in the here after
Classic With this mic like Mike when he was blacker and you
You and remind of me when I was wacker
I read lines and bring drama like a actor
But I’m so Hollywood that you would think that I’m a rapper
You think I got it backwards? It really doesn’t matter
Producer meets the rapper he’s the former I’m the latter
Spacing out this bar so you niggas cloud climb on
I'm proof that you could still make loot and keep your rhymes strong
Burn out the industry as hot as my performance be
The mainstreams dream meets the nightmare of normalcy
The anti of every thing cool
Still most likely to succeed cuz there ain't no rules

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
My nigga we out here, four door Cutlass
Ain't enough room for your luggage
Don't trip
You fabricate to the public we don’t believe shit
Believe it or not call your bluff then leave your ass wit knots
The juggernaut is in your rectum, call Pac and resurrect him
I'm sure to cause a spectrum
Especially with my mental telepathy start to f' em aka fuck'em
Aka nothings in my way once I start b-b-bucking
Fuck up your function and your house party my life's shortly about fortune and vice
If the feds caught me I tread softly the judge toss me life
And your autopsy and my posse came through properly right
Everyone's watching me all right if you're not watching me like
Sent my big cousin a kite got my shit buzzing when there wasn't even a doorbell, a insect or light year in sight
Amen now won't you be a man and pay respects
Enjoy as we progress destroy ya baby steps
Enjoy Son Enjoy son
Enjoy Son Enjoy son
Enjoy Son



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Back in the projects
Back in the projects
I lost it all, all, all, all
Now I'm back in the projects
I can't get all of you in it

[Bridge]
Big slugs, hardcore drugs
Everything crooked, what you thought this was?
Steam pot, turned powder into rock
Plan go sour, that's how you get got
Aww shit, got it poppin' into bricks
Part of playing cool now it's time to get rich
Keep in mind, never walk 'round blind
I can't get all of you in it

[Verse 1]
All that back and forth gets me hot sometimes
Wanna see somebody get knocked out, just box one time, shit
Catch a fade, catch a fade, it ain't nothin'
Get your head up, at the gym, bring your knuckles
Look, I'm deep inside the projects where it's brackin' at
You know the zip
Where we take a quarter piece, flip it, 'til the corner lit
A1 yola, that fresh over the border shit
Shoot outs and abortions, situations so unfortunate
I knew a nigga, doin' double digits, bust the head wide
For another nigga who's scared to rep his set right
Now in solitary, doin' push ups by his bedside
All he want is a Green Dot, his homie keepin' himself fly
Don't come around without your pass, niggas on they tip
Zero tolerance on niggas money, niggas want they shit
Don't start nothing without your blower, that's a one way trip
Six feet under, real life, that's all gunplay is
That is that hood shit
When young niggas on that misunderstood shit
Jumpin' out of smokin' rentals, Ks with the wood grips
Bitches for them bank statements will come and hit a full split
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?

[Chorus]
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
I can't get all of you in it

[Verse 2]
Niggas jaw-jacking, they ain't on that hood shit
Bitch we 'bout that action, on that wish you would shit
All red flags, swag on ten
We ain't in the club, we can't get our goods in
So we in the hood, lituations look grim
One time circlin' for colors of your skin
Black lives matter out here, no way
Cops get promotions while the family gotta pray
It's fucked up, can't explain, babies all in a dump truck
It's all about that money mane, miss me with that Trump stuff
Tryna make a dollar outta fifteen, don't get fucked up
It's shake in the bag, get a bud then you lucked up
You fakin', you mad, you got a issue, you get fucked up
Get laid on yo' ass, you feeling bad, your blunt's crushed up
We in the set, just bickin' it like the Cosbys
Tryna get dope, live happy days like Chachi
If you get a call from papi, that's like Jesus callin'
All you do is execute, next ten seasons ballin'
You can get the world, stay loyal, why you even trip?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?

[Chorus]
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
I can't get all of you in it

On the WFS motherfucker, make him drink his jizz
Tellin' lies about me when I'm tryna make it in the biz
Pop open my coke and feel the violеnt fizz
Wagyu got me fatter than motherfuckin' Dr. Ryz
Likе Dunford, I'm finna pop a kid
I see bag of hash, next thing I'm finna place a bid
Lay back, jack off in the crib

My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?

[Verse 2: RJLDiablo]
As I lay back, in a Maybach
Or properly pronounced "Maybach"
Life hurts more than my back
Shout out Sa Vich, my man
Been fuckin' with women longer than my mans
I dropped from the skylands
We been gettin' high, man
Then we break an iPad
13, motherfucker! I just made a finance

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & RJLDiablo]
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free
An album for a King, another classic CD
Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
Nigga, now R.I.P
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression

[Outro: RJLDiablo]
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy

[Intro Sample: Blizzard from the movie Juice]
"Don't look at me goddammit!
Ayo Q, you want a piece of this?"

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
City filled with this filthy air
Evil pump in my blood, how dare you to stare
Never felt fair, no room for a tear
Come on dump, don't give a fuck if the coast clear
Jacket cover the ratchet, pants hang to my calf
Burner over the ab, sendin' shots under your jab
You really wanna diss me?
Believe it like Ripley when I'm off the fifth of whiskey
Damaging my kidney, I wish a nigga tempt me
Then it's all bad, leave his parents all sad
Cops with a mystery, murderin' ain't shit to me
This a killing symphony, my nigga, for real
I still keep the weapon concealed, body will spill
Hollow tips stuck in your grill, give a fuck how you feel
Tired of resisting this murder addiction
Fuck a conviction, bust shots, slaughter conviction
Lucifer soul, my temperature cold
Eyes blood shot, throwin up blood clots, body in shock
I need me a doc, but I figure I'm too sick
Fuck it, adrenaline pumping may lead in to something
Assumption on life is still, livin' a trife
Asthmatic causing havoc, keep spazzin' til my brain get damaged
Still remain most scandalous, that bang hammers
Fuck surveillance, shit, murk in front of cameras
Dump 'em in the sand like tan or big blands
More grammar shit, I'm the illest motherfucker
Verse 2: [Kendrick Lamar]
Splash blocks like Dikembe when I sensai, who wanna shoot?
The liquor hear me, I'm off the Remy like Papoose
I got the truths of a thousand bishops
Troops of a thousand niggas, you can get your ass missing
Like a white bitch with big tits to be specific
I'm over they heads when the words get pledged
Fright night, gun tucked tight like a newborn
Dance with the Devil, hopefully you get your groove on
When I blaze this metal
Like a rolling stone, flesh and bones come out
Like a thug reunion, watch yall dumb out
Most likely, half of you fraudulent niggas don't like me
Scared to fight me even if you had hands just like me
K Dot, bare arms like a haltertop
Live from the barbershop, who want a fade?
Who want war? I got a drawer full of hand grenades
Take it back to them Contra days, so fall back
It's real, off cognac, and pills, we twist caps then peel
Bananas with the hammers, play if you will
A bullet proof for a shield, that won't work
I got big big very big big bullets, and they hurt
Lift up your skirt if you play pussy, don't push me, I'm light
You pushing up daisies, if the pump do a push up tonight
I put, I put a new price on your head, like a mannequin dressed well
Students from Harvard can hear the nigga Yale
I'm cold hearted, oh well
I get's retarded, the yellow bus I'm a park it
In front of your house, hop out, gun in ya mouth (Blakka!)
Duck shows in your peek hole, me and my Hoover crip
But all I bang is your bitch, don't get me twist
Let's do this, I'm ludicrous, disturbing the peace
Pacing back and forth like a stewardess, it's plain to see
Da Evils

"If you gotta go out, that's how you go out!
That motherfucker took his destiny in his own hands!"

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Thuggin' on other planets, pluckin' my black antennas
Listenin' for freelancers that bitted my style in famish
I don't allow the cameras, I don't allow the managers
I just break down the answers and hope humanity handles it
This is no radio fluke, this is me takin' your food
This is you bullied to school, give up your jacket and shoes
This how I practice the rules, this is what happen when dudes
Like Flying Lotus notice the genius they wrote it is rude
You should promote it, I diagnosed it with viruses through
Microphone's hopin' the plug is runnin' inside of Pro Tools
How can I dodge you buffoons?
I could collide a kaleidoscope with the stars and the moon
The moment I morph in my mood
These are the gorgeous'd of tunes
Police reported then tried to sort it with criminal views
This is intentional fuel
For the fireball dragon, fire shots where you wrastlin'
AK over the dash and now vacate with the Jurassics
The jungle, the wicked masses, the saber-tooth eighty proof
On my breath, this the look of death, this ain't auntie's Mercedes Coupe, yes

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
It's over, it's really over
Kobe really retired, it's crazy!
It's just a trip to even be doing this right now
Kobe really retiring

[Director]
Call in marks, Kendrick take one

[Kendrick Lamar]
What can I say?
I mean really, what can we say?
Day by day, season by season, twenty, to be exact
Growing up watching him paint murals
Using this building as his first studio
Using L.A. as his canvas
Restoring crowns back to where they belong
Under royal banners, purple and gold
The color of royalty
My one man L.A. king

[Announcer]
Back to Kobe, fallaway pull up
Oh! What a way to finish!

[Kendrick Lamar]
Kobe
Never meaningless could never mean less
That's what he means at this moment
All season has been his goodbye
Him to us, us to him, to the whole world

[Sample from untitled 07]

Still got magic, but he made it magical
From Compton to Crenshaw
Jack to Jeanie
We were all witnesses
To all things that was him
I mean, we shared with him the world

[Announcer]
Kobe, inside the three point arc...
Kobe Bryant has hit a shot at the buzzer!

[Kobe Bryant]
WOO!

[Kendrick Lamar]
Soon enough, he became our identity
If you wasn't born and raised here
Or never lived here
You probably would never understand
I'm-a make sure you do

I'm talking about the 81 points
I'm talking about the afro
I'm talking about the alleyoop to Shaq
The off-glass buzzer beater over D-Wade
The game four overtime takeover in the Finals

Kobe
I'm talking about the posterizing of Steve Nash
I'm talking about Dwight Howard's rookie year when he got baptized
You remember that
Kobe bodied him
The helicopter
The five parades
Kobe

[Sample from untitled 07]

The mashed-up gamut of emotions with you and with ourselves is so deep
I don't think nobody can break that bond
So I ask, how do empires last when there's no longer an emperor?
I mean, we got you
But at the same time, we got you
I'm talking about your blood, your sweat, your tears
Even your DNA is placed in these L.A. concretes, man
And nothing would ever replace that or erase that
Forever great in our hearts
So with that being said
Know that it's never goodbye
It's simply respect due
Our due, forever
Kobe



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, "The Devil is a lie, make a better choice"
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Verse 3: Punch]
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Rayshawn Boyce

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, "Is there really a God?"
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it

When I get up all in ya
Tell your girlfriend I beat it up
So she can tell her friend I beat it up
So I can get some fame, about my pipe game
And slang my wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee (that’s funny to me)
Like a pornstar
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Now they know who I are

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I was in high school
Met this little bad bitch
She had all the Jordan shoes
Hair in a ponytail
Earrings bamboo
I said no disrespect
Girl I want a sample
She said, “You don’t know me yet”
I said, “What that got to do with it”
One week or nine months I’m still gon’ hit it
Now admit it, you’re tempted, temptation is a motherfucker
Now let your guard down
I just wanna fuck you
I’m hard right now
I put that on me
She giggled and said, “I’m full of curiosity"
Well you know curiosity killed the cat
So as we walk home from school show me where you live at
Walked in, put the rubber on, then I killed that
Walked out, she hopped on the phone, girl he did that
Hm hm
Her friend on the other end thinking how she gonna get a piece of him
Preach

When I get up all in ya
Tell your girlfriend I beat it up

Now they know who I are

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, it’s Ab-Soul
Used to fuck on my momma’s sofa
Them were the good old days but now a nigga older
I think back of when I chased that cat
Like a horny dog, nigga wet dreams and all
Waking up in cold sweat thinking bout them hoes, y’all
No holds barred I would go so hard
Sending bitches notes in class so much I hardly passed
Hoping she give me the mule yeah throw me that ass
I made her laugh
Maybe walk her home
Maybe get some dome
Like Super Bowl Sunday
And then I’m gone
Off to the next
Call her on the phone
This was before text
Carson High we was on them chicks”
Let them play the good role then we make them cake mix
That’s a flip if you didn’t know
Let the homie hit though
Then she tell her girlfriend, then we let her join in

[Outro]
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em my handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh

[Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
It seems like, you can't win for losing
Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
Sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like

[Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch now, thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
Instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothingness surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man

See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...

Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?

Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?

I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Bridge 2: Bēkon]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities"
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'



[Intro: Mac Miller]
Uh, close your eyes

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Iman Omari]
So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waster of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition 'bout these women and suspicion
Got me lookin' at shit different, how a man in my position
Can't start slippin' down these slopes 'cause it's all just downhill from there
As a kid I didn't learn that, but now I'm aware
When you a youngin' you just tryna live your life and have some fun in
A world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is...

[Chorus: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
Stay high
Go for what you know
Let it in your mental
And don't ever let it go
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh
And I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night, wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie, can't you see I'm chillin'? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah, my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep at Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on a idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, "Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"
Just continue livin' life, 'cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restart now, 'cause we comin' for you anyways

[Chorus: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
Stay high
Go for what you know (Yeah)
Let it in your mental (Macadelic)
And don't ever let it go
It ain't never gon' stop, 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
(No) Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
Uh, I told you it won't stop, 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make her
Wrap this much make-up off my bed, soon as she's yawnin', take up
Hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame
The emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me
That you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see
I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you

[Chorus (Condensed): Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Outro]
Fuck me
I want you to fuck me (I want you to fuck me)
I want you to fuck me (Oh yeah)
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Don't stop
Stop



[Intro]
'Cause I ain't about to roll it if I ain't rollin' that fire
Yeah the sun is goin' down but I'm tryna take you higher
We both know this house could never be a home
But ain't you sick of spendin' all your nights alone?
If it's lovin' that you want, girl, I promise you desire

[Chorus]
No conversation when I come around
Run my fingers through your baby hair
I wanna take you there
For sure, you know what it's about
We'll find our limit when you say we're there
I wanna take you there
You toot it up, I tear it down
You bring it back, I wear it out
Hit it like whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop

[Verse]
Baby, you're the finest
Pussy taste like diamonds
How'd you get so timeless?
Wanna get behind it, behind it
Remind ya, I know how to find it
Hit it how you like it
Show you how we slide, how we slide, back in L.A., L.A.
Park circle, that way
Ready for the showdown, the Wild Wild West way
Ooh, you know you're flame
And I put that on my last name
I'ma take my time in it, climb in it for the day

[Chorus]
No conversation when I come around
Run my fingers through your baby hair
I wanna take you there
For sure, you know what it's about
We'll find our limit when you say we're there
I wanna take you there
You toot it up, I tear it down
You bring it back, I wear it out
Hit it like whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop

[Outro]
'Cause I ain't about to roll it if I ain't rollin' that fire
Yeah the sun is goin' down but I'm tryna take you higher
We both know this house could never be a home
But ain't you sick of spendin' all your nights alone?
If it's lovin' that you want, girl, I promise you desire

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the you been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a read-along
Ain't a sing-a sing-along 'less you brought the along
Then ju… okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a no don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then for my head get to
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often

Uh, yeah, yeah, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a don’t-a don't exist
Girl, I know you want this
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Uh)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Uh)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast

[Verse 1]
It's a wonderful day to have some fun
Might go shoot a guy with my gun
Havin' a holly jolly time in the sun
Don't have to compete, cuz I already won
Hit him with the beam like Obi-Wan
Hit him with the stick, score a home run
I love meth, I got a fuck-ton
Killin' off opps with a submachine gun
Happy day, no dun dun dun
Ice drip like a water gun
Why do I keep rhyming gun?
Cuz It's Floppa Friday let's have some fun! (WOO)

[Chorus]
Floppa Friday, I feel so nice
Floppa Friday, I got the ice
Floppa Friday, I feel so nice
Floppa Friday, I'm eating rice

[Verse 2]
I love Floppa Friday
Make me say "hip-hip-hooray"
When the sky is lookin' grey
I have my gun, I'll find my way
Killin' opps is child's play
Then I feast on them like prey
Got thе strap and then I spray
Don't ask Floppa how much he weigh
[Chorus]
Floppa Friday, I feel so nicе
Floppa Friday, I got the ice
Floppa Friday, I feel so nice
Floppa Friday, I'm eating rice
Floppa Friday, I feel so nice
Floppa Friday, I got the ice
Floppa Friday, I feel so nice
Floppa Friday, I'm eating rice[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Pardon my Bohemian ways
I know I act like I be stuck in a Bohemian daze
You said you love me, so don't rush me
Love is patient and now you gotta trust me
To take form, like the canvas of the Grand Canyon
Product of a beautiful storm or an unborn
Carried just below the heart
Quietly preparing for his start
Let me Michelangelo my Sistine Chapel
You know they say Rome wasn't built in a day
And diamonds need a while before they hit the display
So I guess I see myself in a similar way
I'm paced, like my momma in the kitchen whipping
Always mixing up and fixing
Begged her for a taste and she said it wasn't ready
She stir it up slow and she cook it up steady
This is not a race track, living in the ASAP
I'm just trying to do it justice when it play back
Sometimes I gotta stall the BPM
So I can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
In the end, I got love for the show biz
But sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
Keeping up with the Kardashians and Joneses
Nah, I take my time and compose this
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It's a secret garden in my mind
Flower child

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Okay, buffering, creativity suffering
When you bustlin' hustlin' for the numbers and
You missed the journey if you climbed too fast
The beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
Amateurs swear they need a balancer
I want that legendary like excalibur
Chasing calibers liberated as a bachelor
Traveler, never falling victim to these calendars
Rough draft after rough draft
No staff, perfecting on my abstract craft
And now they calling me celebrity
Only thing I give a damn about is my integrity
They play the game like checkers when I'm talking bout chess
Tryna do more when I'm talking bout less, I stress
Quantity ain't always quality
So let me formulate my prophecy

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When the lights get low and you notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow but only little you know
I will still breathe, give me the keys
I'm resuscitating the game, see me in CPR
My name is a gun cocked, gun shot
Dead and I won't stop
Gun cocked, gun shot
Head in a pine box
With a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot
Flowers on your momma's yard
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It's a secret garden in my mind
Flower child

[Outro: Nitty Scott]
They say greatness gets better with time
So why expedite my prime?
See I'm just a lilac tied to the earth
Exuding the fragrance of light and birth
So respect my photosynthesis
My petals, my stems, full of nourishing flow
You thought this was a love song, but no
I just need you to let me grow[Intro]
Sound without Focus... is just noise

[Verse 1: ProVerb]
With so much knock in the LBC
It was hard not to claim that DPG
Summertime popped in the L-A-C
With the music courtesy of D-A-Z
And the Soopa, Doopa, Fly for the troopers
Riders, supers, hoes, groupies
All of 'em with the short tight jeans on
"Let's Play House" all of 'em theme song
Word on the gangsta, squad up
Black, brown, throw a St. Ides up
Then the West got harder
And Soopafly hit 'em on the head on Tha Doggfather
Don't nobody party like the West though
G-Funk been the sound since Death Row
Where you think we got the kicked-in clap at?
Time to bring it back, bitch, and it's like that

[Chorus: Latoya Williams]
Only in L.A, Only in L.A
Where the gangsters play, Where the gangsters play
Catching up on fame
Summertime in, West Coast ride
[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Come up out that shithole, gotta get this money
Long Beach, CR, all this shit is sunny
Put the monkey in it like the shit is funny
Banana clip Ras about to split this dummy
The funk just told me to kick back
I like revenge, retaliation and get back, nigga
Got more bars than Kit-Kat
Get smacked like Kat Stacks if you lift, Jack
A motherfucker better recognize
With a flick of my wrist like Kevorkian, you all die
All I do was ball high
Trying to stay above the rim like a tall guy
That niggas' ass super fly
Y'all ride Lexus, (?), left lane, tall ride
OG to BG, I tried to warn ya
Only in California

[Chorus: Latoya Williams]
Only in L.A, Only in L.A
Where the gangsters play, Where the gangsters play
Catching up on fame
Summertime in, West Coast ride

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Rolling down Rosecrans bumping D-A-Z
Feeling like 1-9-9-3 '91 to the seventh jam
I'm in Long Beach, home of dillagent, dilligent gangsta shit
Gangsters killing, you wanksters quit filling your iPod's up with classics
Ain’t a nigga out can out-match them adlibs
DPGC general
Jay know my breath marching, hold all my genitals
Yeah, it's like that cause I was taught that
Back when Dog Food dropped in the Compton swap meet parking lot
Daddy rehab three, so going to my pops we was popping now
The trunk in the caddy was rocking now
Slap a nigga in the face with a little waist, even make 'Pac salute
Snare like a bear trap, they're imperible too
Bear witness
Kids like Barry Bonds, that's the realest, nigga
[Chorus: Latoya Williams]
Only in L.A, Only in L.A
Where the gangsters play, Where the gangsters play
Catching up on fame
Summertime in, West Coast ride[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Mothafucka this is Watts, California, Nickerson Gardens
Follow me home back to my project apartment
Land of the palm trees, buying weed, we smoking
Home of the low-lows, 6-4's, we rollin
Chuck Taylor's and Nikes, wife beaters and white tees
Up in the Bay area, boys gettin hyphy
Los Angeles where them boys rocking them colors hard
Running from one time, we ain't living behind them bars
Take you on Crenshaw, then show you how to ride a car
Hit a couple of switches, you won't have to buy a bra
Take you on Slauson, I'm flossin, lookin like a star
Witta bad bitch with ass and cash in her bra
Pocket full of cash, we smash, we all at the mall
Hit a swapmeet, snatch some khakis up off the wall
Turn your music up cus we don't give a fuck about the law
Only Lord knows, this is California soul

[Hook: Game]
C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A
My name rang in MIA, I'm the talk of New York
Down in ATL, they smell me, so ain't shit niggas could tell me
Ask in Mo-town, they'll tell you how it go down
Ain't no California love
We California thugs, we throw California slugs
So throw up a California dub
[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Mothafucka this is Watts, California, Nickerson Gardens
Follow me home back to my project apartment
Gotta get money homey, we hustle regardless
Changin my number nigga the streets steady callin, but
Moneys my target, nobodys flawless
Step in my building still got the work under my carpet
Still living heartless, rats, roaches crawlin
Killa Killa Cali, plenty souls deparment
South Central active, gang bang capitol
Bloods and Crips runnin the city dawg, it's factual
What set you claim? Little homey they askin you
Wrong color, wrong sign, boy they blastin you
And when you passin though better have a pass with u
Because these boys in the hood they'll casket you
Nothin but the truth is what I'm givin you
Lord knows, the life of a California soul

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Mothafucka this is Watts, California, Nickerson Gardens
Follow me home back to my project apartment
Still in my hood on my beach cruiser, pedaling
Niggas think I'm a rookie but got the heart of a veteran
Nigga I'm a doctor, you hear I got that medicine
For them patients they say the go around me but that's irrelavent
Balls hangin low just like a elephant, still ridin high like a pelican
Nigga I ain't studder man, I do it for the gutta men
I do it for my people on a hustle on a struggle, we go? dawg
I do it for the W, west coast my coast, Watts, California
My hood my burough, plus I gotta keep it thorough
Man I gotta keep it gangsta
That's what I am no wanksta, never that
Momma never raised a chump, watch what you sayin huh
Only Lord knows, California soul[Intro: Jay Rock]
Pop

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Walking through Watts
Where the streets painted with gangsters and crooked cops
Benjamin Franks, same case and crack cocks
That's all we know
Make it up out the hood, that's all we hope
Smoking cookie backwards, got TV's in it
Sell they soul, just to get the cocaine feeling
Don't get caught slipping, humping them projects
Wrong turn, wrong color will get you top decked
YG's, they'll do anything for stripes
Hard headed, don't even take OG's advice
Hood rats bitches do anything for ice
Set you up, good pussy will take your life
And why do the police scared to roll through the niggas in gardens
Even they ass stay with the target
Crack spots, moving out the unit apartment
My neighborhood trife, you couldn't walk a day in my life
So yeah

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
I'm from the gutter, that's all that I know
Crack pot, dope spots, gun shots, I wonder, will you follow me home?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, south paws, we out here, and Pharrell here
Don't come 'round here, looking for John Doe
That's something that I know, Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
And I'm stocked like .40 tucked in my drawers
Over the stove, catch me whipping a ton of tar
Chopping it down, smoke is on foot, in and out
The choppers is popped, niggas will kill you over an ounce, it's real
Can't squeal, welcome to Iraq, city rats
Roaches on the corners of cul de sacs
Click, clack (Pow), officers down
LA PD on tv with bullet holes
Don't tell him where bullets go
Send him to Martin Luther, pull him from the shooters
Stay home on your computer
We ain't internet banging, nigga we really hating
Out here, all my life I gave blood sweat and tears
In these streets, don't show no signs of fear
Niggas eat you alive, put holes in your ride
Snatch up your kids when you see 'em sitting outside
Watch by survivor, I'm grateful that I'm alive
Streets

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
I'm from the gutter, that's all that I know
Crack pot, dope spots, gun shots, I wonder, will you follow me home?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, when the sun falls, we out here, and Pharrell here
Don't come 'round here, looking for John Doe
That's something that I know, Yeah, yeah, yeah[Produced by J. Cole]

[Chorus: J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, bitch
That should be my new ad lib
I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch
[Outro Skit: Lil Cole]
Yo, yo, yo pull over right here, right here, here you go
Yeah pull over right here, to the right
Pull over, pull over, pull over, pull over
Ight, look look, park right here
I'ma be out it'll be like thirty minutes tops
It'll be like thirty minutes, I'll be right back out, ight
Bitches come and go, bitches come and
Yo, yo what up, what's popping, I'm back, I'm back
Yo you got that piece ready for me, that Jesus piece
Nah the gold, the rose gold joint, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro: Darlene Tibbs]
Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pit bull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free

[Outro: Darlene Tibbs]
I'ma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king

Lyrics from Snippet 1

Hope my daughter isn't born with a piece of my heartbreak
You know stress carries on, now your kids reap the mistakes that you made
And...

Lyrics from Snippet 2

...like Prince Rogers
I feel liberation is free, I feel I should diss the Oscars
Are you celebrating me as the artist or just a prophet?

Lyrics from Snippet 3

...games
And I admit that I’m bad at talking myself out of shame
But who's to blame when the crowd start cheering and they passing dirty looks?
I now understand that I'll never be understood
Isolation didn’t work for me
Socializing didn't work for me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
(Breathing)
What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, "You crazy?"
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, "Where's Ricardo?"
You said, "Oh, no, not the show"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit"
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible"

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)

[Refrain: Bilal]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh

[Poem]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home

[Verse]
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick

(Verse 1: Kendrick)
Check me out
She say she love it when it sounds like this
She tell me Kendrick put it down like this
When I listen I wanna close my eyes
And feel your lips
Let your lyrics wrap around me and grab my hips
So enticing
On point like the helmet of a Viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I could get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she wanna vent
Now she could talk about her boss and I can give advice
Or she could take the panties off and I could eat the (PIE PIE)
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune
You know why?

This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm Playing shit my girlfriend'll like
Hahaha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Aba, this shit my girlfriend'll like my nigga

Look

(Verse 2: Kendrick)
We be in the car, bumpin' my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 p.m
It's a club banger
Catchy hooks and 808's
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
The first 8 bars, she's lovin' the track
Even rewinding it back
Soon as the beat drop
The way she react she like "That's Hot"
'Til I start talkin' bout how many hoes I got
How many I fucked
How many I've misled just to get a nut
Like a squirrel, in pursuit of lunch
Uh
Though I'm on some cliché rapper shit
I know she thinking are my lyrics that accurate
She's so cool doe
Don't downplay her just to fuck up the mood yo
She'll still play it even though I sound rude yo
And disregards to the provocative records
One thing that I do know

This something my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I'm playing something that my girlfriend'll like
Told you that my girlfriend'll like
Other hoes tonight
Soul

(Verse 3: Ab-Soul)
This something my girlfriend'll like too
Kendrick I got you

This a great idea
This'll be my girlfriend's joint right here
So I'mma kick the shit she like
It seem right
Like a pair of jeans that fit tight
Around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
At the movies
Her body language gets read
Like a ruby
Cause she a work-a-art
No help from Julie
I'mma beast and she such a beauty
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her
Far from an arc, but best undercover
Kodak moment every time we in sync
Like a iPod plugged to a USB
It's just you and me
I mean me and her
I mean her and I
It's plain to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me
You know where Herbert is
On her mind
Like she on mine
Uh
Play some shit my girlfriend'll like
Cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
She do music too, this shit my girlfriend'll write
If she was me talking bout her
DJ

Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I wrote some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Now I'm sho' to get some cuddy



[Intro]
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac Brougham
Looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California, One love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him round 3:30, Telling me it's all good
Tiger Woods, Now we looking for the birdy birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
Pulled up on the breezies, Well what do you know? I think they love us

[Hook]
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good (hey)
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
Represent the city like you know you should (hey)
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on

[Verse 2]
As I continue my day, quite copacetic
Headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas
ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions
But anyway I'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima
Ashtray got a million roaches, I'm focussed but feeling good
The homies hanging on {?} and Monte Carlos
Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to
Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say?
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you can't relate then please have a seat

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
And put on for the soil of which you was grown
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers
I'm such a fool with it, go nuts
You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck
The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us
This ain't for you, so what?!

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Wrekonize & Bernz]
You said you'd never ever break... down
But here I am sweeping... pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never, ever play... to crowds
But I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now
I've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone...

[Hook: Wrekonize & Kendall Morgan]
We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile
(You’re not alone)
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(We’ve been here before)
I don’t ever want to change
I’m fragile
I don’t ever want…
I don't ever...

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Some of the people appointed to give an opinion
Never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and... die
N9na be givin the remedy and why?
Critics are really the enemy and I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne I'ma look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto
Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin'
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'ma despise
Never do try to listen
It's real - I'm mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this:
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes I'm

[Hook Wrekonize & Kendall Morgan]
We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile

I don’t ever want to change
I’m fragile
I don’t ever want…
I don't ever...

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me that I'm famous
Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop...
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop...
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved should've known my music

[Hook Wrekonize & Kendall Morgan]
We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile
(You’re not alone)
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(We’ve been here before)
I don’t ever want to change
I’m fragile
I don’t ever want…
I don't ever...

Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice

Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade.

[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable rights" of "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." We refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. So we have come to cash this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice

Got me breathing with dragons
I crack the egg on you bastard
Why you step to the master
Like you sick with this
I really do this shit
You not equivalent to the Kdot the almighty
Watch this, I will body
Anybody in the crowd
You want me john gotti, couldn't see me
You peeping this is freestyle off top of the dome
I'll let you know why every other rapper need to go home
This a new verse, I put rappers in new hearse
I take rappers to new church
Who wanna see me, you first
Then him second, then you third
Nouns, my verbs
Battle these words
Nigga that shit is absurd

Troi Breeze:

OK if I'm 2nd or I'm 3rd
Whatever he just said you heard
But I'm coming through and I think that I got a new verse
Goin' off the top of the dome
I'm really tryna change the way that I've been livin' at home
I'm really doin' it
Nigga I be doin' this
Nigga I come through with this
Nigga I will do it and I swear I am so studious
Nigga I'm a student and I peeped the way you did it
Now I'm bout to do it off of the top of the fuckin' tip
Kendrick:

If you bout to do off of the top, then fucking did it
If you say that you the best, then nigga won't you admit it
I see you got the waves in your hair i been there
Back in 8th grade, when the pussy i was scared
But now im seeing all kinds of woman in peripheral
This is individual, this here is a ritual
This here is spiritual
This is not rap , this is god body
Nigga this ain't nothing close to lyrical

Troi Breeze:

Shit all I'm sayin now is I agree with you
I been grownin' in it like I was a tree with you
Now I'm tryna do it like I was a seed and I grew up
And now I'm blessed like I just sneezed; hachew
I really appreciate it
I really appreciate you callin me up cause I'm out here and I'm ballin' it up
Taking the biggest shots, and now I been getting' it tryna spend the biggest knots
Cause I'm really out here tryna grind for my family
Tryna go off of that energy, I know you feel my "inner G"
My brotha was from Piru
My pops was from what's he was raised out on Grape Street
Kendrick:

Well if ya brother was from Piru and your partna was from Watts
Then you should already know about them Compton blocks
All my niggas that's with me is from the city
All my niggas hold choppas and they be with me
And this is TDE this is stri-stri- strictly for my niggas and bitches tell me you with me
(crowd roar)
You see that scream right there, thats that scream that every other rapper scared
Thats that scream that every other clapper scared
They dont want shoot back
If they did they would get bitch slapped like my nigga Snoop Dogg back in '94
This is Kurupt flow
This is the LBC shit
This the Compton DPGTDE shit
FUCK WITH ME SHIT

Make some noise for my nigga

Troi Breeze:

My name is Troi Breeze

Kendrick:

Make some noise for Troi Breeze

[Intro]
Come on
Me, I've been searching, for that right one
And hopefully I found her
I found her

[Verse 1]
My nigga tells me 'bout this girl that he knows, oh
Said she the type of girl that I'm looking for, oh
Shout me her number and said make sure I call, oh
Got straight to the point when she picked up the phone
When she picked up the phone she said hello and I said

[Hook]
A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
A friend of mine said that you was with everything
A friend of mine said that you are good company
A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
Got good pussy baby
Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious
I want it baby
Gotta have it baby
Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious

[Verse 2]
Now girl I don't mean to come off so strong
But I heard that you got the love that I want
Can you promise me that it's true what they say?
Before you tell me your name? Is you with it?

[Hook]
A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
A friend of mine said that you was with everything
A friend of mine said that you are good company
A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
Got good pussy baby
Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious
I want it baby
Gotta have it baby
Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious
{Bridge}
Tell me is you with it?
Is you with it? (4 times)
Tell me are you with it?
Are you with it? (4 more times)

[Verse 3]
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
That coochie, that twat, that pussy stuff
Whatever you wanna call it, I can't get enough
I can be your lover, be your friend
Be your number one or your ten
Baby yell dress, and just like UPS or FedEx girl we can both send
Then pray in the morning, then after we pray more play in the morning
Have it your way like a shoe custom made whenever you need
Or maybe like a chain of Burger King's
I promise if we do it, I'll remain serene
I truly understand
Nobody gotta know like a group of yes men
So momma don't trip
And if it goes well we can make you a flip

So what it's gon' be miss lady my clock is tickin'
So please tell me you accept my proposition
Are you gonna tell me now?
Or you need more time if you do that's fine
As long as it goes down, girl make up your mind

[Verse 1]
Hallelujah, K. Dot'll do ya
Quicker than a porno star, jump on my dick y'all
And get fucked by the millisecond
Duck when I pull the weapon from out of my mouth (Buh!)
Shots at you like a sawed-off
Aiming for your grill like I'm Paul Wall
Then peal 'til I not y'all
My cerebral cortex is like a war vet
Sharing war stories with the deceased, I'm brain dead
Straight bananas, I never gave a fuck
'Bout anything but my momma, my daddy, siblings, and grandma
And if you neither one of them, then I gotta answer
Every question with a bullet hole in my hammer
Like VH1, that's far beyond your comprehension
Like a deaf person showing up to court for a hearing
Who they fearing? K. Dot
Tickle the nipples of women
Make your bitch grab her crotch when she hear my shit, bitch!

[Verse 2]
K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
On fire, make a rapper burn his soul
Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals
Numero uno, city in my rearview
Compton on my back like the titties of my masseuse
Pity, here you fool who?
Go against me, I rebuke thee
And wake thee up, six in the morning
With the pump, punks jump up to get beat down
Jump shot, coroners catch them on the rebound
Pans, pots, plates, bowls
I'm in your kitchen eating your stove
I'm hungry and hibernated
I'm cold as Miles Davis
I load up then I aim it
No judgment for the plaintiff
It only gets more heinous, nigga I'm brainless
Like a blind bitch who don't suck dick
Dinosaur manure, big shit
Smell me or die quick, fucka!
(Fuck a hook)
(jab, jab, jab, left right)
(Fuck a hook)
(Damnit, genius)
[Verse 3]
I can stand in a pool of gasoline lighting a blunt and never catch on fire
(How come?) Silly motherfucker, I'm fire
Smack the devil over the cheek, gave him a third degree burn
Iced it down when he was asleep, and said you'll be okay
A lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day
They hydroplaning, hoping that they get their big break
I'm just saying, I feel I'm the one
Like a magician with a stick inside his hand, or the name of a mexican
I gets ignorant with ya
Snap me a picture, bitch, I'm famous
I came in this world nuts in my palm and drinking Paul Masson
In a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron
Locked him in a basement and amputated his shooting arm
(Psss) Now that's a stretch Ab-Soul
Like a fifty mile strip when I'm pimping these hoes
Call me Dolomite, nope I take that back
Found out he gay as a happy day or the way that you rap
(ee)

(K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
On fire, make a rapper burn his soul
Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals)
(Look, ee)

Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju-, okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin', I'm beast

Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley, now
Vacay'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali (Mmm)
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Mmm)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Mmm)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow (Mmm) Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holler back, I'll do ya, beast

Angry adolescents, three things on our minds
Money, murder and you

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, (Drake) & A$AP Rocky]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem)
Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Picture perfect, uh huh
And I paint a perfect picture, my intention's to get richer
But I ain't tryna split the profit with ya
Every pocket on me bleeds, I'm a selfish ass nigga
Mmm, deuces up, black coupes is us (Uh, huh)
Or maybe the white on white, Ku and Klux
Head all in the bathroom
Beg for it, I'll be back soon
Fuckin' problem, fuck your problems
I got my own but one ain't a dollar
I got five phones for five different reasons
London, Tasha, Mya, Keisha
Courtney, blue-eyed devils with no Visas
Overseas, high heels, wine and pizza
Overdosed on bad bitches, I swear
One on both arm but need two pair, I beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, (Drake) & A$AP Rocky]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem)
Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz-is-to-Me-Just-a-Car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya, beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, (Drake) & A$AP Rocky]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem)
Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it

[Skit]
Gather around. I'm glad everybody came out tonight. As we stand on our neighborhood corner, know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have. Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front. I recognize all of you. Every creed and color. With that being said... fuck your ethnicity. You understand that? We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you. All of you...

[Intro]
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high

[Chorus]
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

[Verse 1]
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind
So don't you mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts
Everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Going postal, never freeze up, when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
HiiiPower
[Interlude]
Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47

[Chorus]
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that math, dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate my dreams, get it right
Get a life, I got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back
That a plane or an angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... gross

[Bridge]
I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you
I'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
Put them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower
And the power in the people and if they don't believe us
They'll die
Wizard
[Chorus]
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga[Verse 1]
Heard a conversation with my father talking to his favorite partner
At the domino table, Tony had told him that he saw a
Young nigga hopping out busting like four charters
Popping pills, mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Sell it to a priest he probably can get it off by tomorrow
It's wicked when my favorite uncle kick it
Fiends trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicks
Vivid images go against any fantasy you can fathom
Phantoms ain't the only thing that suicidal
Open the doorway to his soul
Hit the hallway then hit the closet you see a rifle
Aim it at your arteries, pardon me, parts of me is pyscho
In retrospect my respect was a power ranger high note
Tumbling backwards into a karate kicking high note
My innocence would eventually see a hindrance
Surrenduring Ninja Turtles, pizza and Sega Genesis
Heard it over my bunk bed ear hustling
Something my papa said that caught my attention
His eyes red he's smoking on marijuana mixing the two eleven
He said I'm seven going on sixty-seven
The day I turned seventeen is the day that a lesson inside my lifetime
Come across a clothes line, every stick is a co-sign
Everything in the streets got the power to make me go blind
Even if he sat me down in the sun and gave me those eyes
Comprehend it well and I could smell the soberness evaporating by itself
He said, "Tony my biggest fear is to hear Kendrick disappeared in the fire out here and I didn't help
So if I can give him the game to hydroplane his decisions in life so he can go
Further than the streets and remain to be on the honor roll"
Sacrifice my life even if that shit, my mama though
Til the day he carried by the big six, domino
[Verse 2]
Backpack raps with gats in it
Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
K Dot Thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier
On point like a pyramid, force to be reckoned with
With the best shit
Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
This is it
I'm in the lab cooking up all day, eff em up all day
Like a nympho, I been dope since s curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well there's chemicals there
I'm in the hood with the 17 year olds that's on hood patrol
And they want stripes so they shoot off bikes and you know
Any moment you can lose your life so kiss your kids or hug your wife or whatnot yo
I spawned with a dragon
He tried to throw his flame but I ducked and I stabbed him
Came out the battle laughing
That's a metaphor for any rapper who want it
I smack em 'til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if I'm there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit that hotel
That's no assumption, cool out before I move out
Hop on the 105 and do about 105 before your ass get threw out
The back seat
There's a dead guy on the freeway, oh it's not Dot
Tell the medics it's okay, a beast when the beat break
You probably think I'm dope like the it's the realest shit I wrote
But to me it's a throw away
I stare at them four walls and rap like I'm mad at God
Nice enough, I throw a spear at Nas, a jab at Jay
Matter fact, no, I take that back
See I don't play with real legends of rap like you do
And I'm crucial, concealed by real Crips and Soowoos
And they shoot, they photography students when beef get to brewing Compton!

[Verse 1]
When I jumped off the porch
I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took its course
I was hoarse from yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
The killers on sight of me, privacy obviously was lost
And the fraud piracy of the streets in my odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walked down the street with no heat
And run into beef when I'm just a vegan
Reekin’ the scent of a saint, sinner smell it then start squeezing
Pellets that's tumblin' straight at my melon, apparent reason
Probably was because of my cousin cuzzin’ a blood
That was bloodin' in public
And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, 'stead of Kendrick, I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, sure that's your remedy
Fair enough, I got enemies but I don't bang
But that's the repercussions like
When your cousin is cuzzin’ a blood
Then you’re by yourself at the Compton parade, he said:

[Pre-Chorus]
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (Pump, pump)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I’m really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know

[Chorus]
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay

[Verse 2]
I seen 'em from afar then I seen a piece of my jaw
Like on the ground, you know the sound
When you hear the people in awe
Sympathetic 'cause they like seeing you
Tryna fight back at a pack of piranhas
I promised three of ’em, beat the black off my back
And pajamas was almost needed
I should've went to sleep and seen some sheep
When I greeted the pavement
Got up and seen the shock on their faces
Like "damn it, he made it"
My luck in the palm of a cherry bomb
And they waitin' to blow up on me
My homies are not alarmed
Then I heard someone's firearm
Make a sound like it waved around my direction
I'm guessing this is the part where my heart
Expected to drop in a second, look at the faults
I've made in the shortest amount of time
And in back of my mind I'm like "this the loss I'ma take"
My fate was distraught
A cape and some superpowers can't save me
I'm probably pushing up daisies
Before I can make my way to the car
Cross cancel and right before I seen
The black glove raisin' the handle, he said:

[Pre-Chorus]
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (Pump, pump)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know

[Chorus]
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay

[Verse 3]
Bitch, I'm bustin' back, I'ma borrow my uncle's strap in a minute
Jump in a Civic then wear that bitch on my lap
I was timid but now I'm tempted
And tenants alert me on where you at
I'm a menace when I'm offended, relentless, I will react
Then somebody said the dispatch
Of an officer, got his mind made on off'n ya
That's a fact when you're black and undeveloped
You're profiled as a felon
I'm bellin' down Boulevards with my basketball and a backpack
Gym shoes and my nap sack
Hair nappy, my ball cap backwards
And then I look back, strobe lights on my tail pipe
Turned left then I turned right
Turned deaf 'cause the sirens is loud
As the colors of pink and yellow on Wesley Snipes
Pray to God I don't get sniped
Pray to God that the sunlight stay shining for 30 more minutes
Hope that a witness around when I'm 'bout to cut off the engine
Vengeance of hatred is what I'm facin'
Even though being a criminal ain't my memo
But this is what he said when I dropped the window:

[Pre-Chorus]
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang
By the time you hear the next shot, you'll learn that L.A.P.D. is the biggest gang (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know

[Chorus]
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay



[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
With these lyrics that I'm kicking
I'm a west coast chemist
I'm a B-L- double O, D shit you niggas know me
You niggas know me when I pull up on your block with a couple homies
Sip that light spliff who’s that snatch ya bitch
Nothing but a g party like Pac in 96
But its 07 no half steppin’
Get outta line no mercy nigga we blast weapons

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
California economics got me hooked on it like phonics
When the beat drop I drop a bomb like atomic
Got my heat cocked like some type of bird
Big pimpin’ weapon under the fur
Limping’ like a prosthetic leg
But still play the back like bike pegs
La fitted cap pulling your wig back
With Glocks in it g roc black tinted
What side you claim fuck yo gang

Yeah Yeah thats what I’m talking bout nigga

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I got more bars than singular
Keep a four five yeah seen me a
Shoot to kill we on the brooklyn bridge
Range Rovers and Coupe Devilles
Middle fingers up to the NYPD
Locked down in them cells thats where they want us Gs
Feds watching got us on camera got a good lawyer he cold like Canada
Nigga I’m a animal, raps new hannibal, king of my jungle, eat you like antelope
Product of the projects nigga I’m the shizznit
You don’t wanna test, give you lames the business
Watts California pay hell a visit, where a wrong turn can be your last visit
Pit Bulls on

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Five in the morning I’m up cooking it up
Studio filled with coffee cups
I don’t sleep I just lay down and wink
I work like slavery was just last week
Somebody told me that every label
Got this button that beep and when I rap it go off
And thats when they know to push their album back
I don’t allow cats around the big dogs
You can’t see me, the force between us is thick fog
I never hang up when the money calls unless it be a emergency that my family involved
Don’t get your life involved, we’ll shoot without playing basketball, get your ass mopped
Like Lysol, you light MC, I’m heavy on the track
If you see my flow you would say its obese
Kdot/Lyrical Disease/Jay Rock
America's Most Wanted
Please

[Intro]
Yeah. How I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good

[Verse 1]
Can I pay my past a visit?
Centennial Compton School District
And video campus shut the fuck up your premises
King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over
Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda
Every time we rode up we was unsober
And everybody had know that
My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat
Which was really dumb because where we was at
Was the other side and more than likely
The other side really didn't like that
Didn't have no burner so if they shot us we could never really shoot back
Could of lost our life over hood rats
We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough
That the black car didn't pull up and ask where yall niggas from
I know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies' bitch
She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro but it wasn't that fast it was like a V6
But anyways she was one of those hoes in highschool with the cornrows
Size 5 Jordans, Rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows
Well she's important, well she wasn't, she was just so and so so and so cousin
He was a red, so anytime she got into it, that who she would get
Now let me get back to the plan
Homie had ask, " Do ya got a man?"
She said,"No", he said, "Oh yeah
Where do you stay?" She said, " Rosecrans"
Rosecrans and what? She said, "Don't matter just know I fuck
He said, "What? you're a, you're a little freaky bitch huh?"
She said, "Yeah daddy I can you get you sprung
I can work that pussy and the tongue
If you come over I can make you cum
If you come over make sure that you bring drink
Because I like to get to drunk."
And that he did, that Friday he was where she lived
Notice that he was out of bounds
But didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
Walked in the house, rubber on, panties down
Oldies playing in the background
Let's get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning
Time to go, picked his pants up off the floor
Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
When he walked out he seen a four four Bluh!
Didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with
[Hook]
And that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
Get your ass killed bitch! How?
Fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes
Them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes
Them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead

[Verse 2]
Look. I guess we all can learn from mistakes
But your first mistake, might be your death date
And death doesn't wait, on no one
A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
He wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
When he went to first get put on the hood
He wasn't born it, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think it was all good
But usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose
Tell everybody quit working, but really he's worthless
His momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
The OG's that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy
And the funny thing about it he thought he was bout it like P-Miller
But he wasn't no killa
Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, "Where are you from?" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one
Never pull out if you don't use it
Even though the dude didn't banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising
Not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit
[Hook]
And that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
Fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! How?
Not knowing the G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, if you don't know then your already dead dead dead
Feel me?

Stone-cold killers in these Compton streets

Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder, it's murder

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Murder this, murder listen, hear that suburban whippin'?
Tinted windows, right at your wifey (Brrrat!)
And I bet you miss her
Reload the protools and we throw the clip in both trays
That's one on the left and one in the right hand
Scottie Pippen, both ways
Been doin' drive-bys
Got this music industry timeline lookin' like Rosecrans
When these niggas throw up them signs high
I'm talking about that bottom where it's high crimes
Shit, I’m just tryna get paid and keep them thighs high (Thighs high)
Sometimes I feel like I could just bury ‘em, bury 'em
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, no scarier area
I'm very aware hip-hop needed somethin' to carry it
So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
And you way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier
This is Hub City, nigga, don't make us embarrass you
Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic
We did the numbers, and you looking like another statistic

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
(Ahh, shit!) Recognize what live inside these eyes
I'ma ride until the dead has risen
Live in a project building, dodging the module ceilings
I ride, I'ma ride in a stolen Jeep
Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)
Mama tried counseling, five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)
My family ties had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (Abducted)
My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (Disgusting)
Our stadium's packed, Raiders in black
Curls dripping, silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one-way street (Blow-blow-blow-blow!)
Nowhere to go, death all I can see (Blow-blow-blow-blow!)
I say "Fuck is up?" I fuck 'em up
Your supper's up, and something's up
I hope he no can walk the tighest rope before the double-dutch
Broke plenty records with this weapon, I protect it under oath
My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life, fuck your hope
Fuck your mama. fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie
Fucked the world up when we came up, that's Compton, homie!

[Bridge]
Murder, murder
Murder... murder
It's all murder... murder
Ahh!

[Intro: Terrace Martin]
What’s happening y’all? It’s Terrace Martin, ay, so check it out
I got three microphones, three of the dopest emcees, a drum machine, two turntables and a mixer
That’s all we need man, we’ll pass the first mic to Kurupt, yeah

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
I'm the militant military
Bald eagle, squeezer, Caesar, Ebenezer
I am the worst (what)
That's what my bitch told me after I took her purse and shook her down
Looking for a pound in that purp, bitch
I'm scandalous, I poke you like deer antlers, cancerous
Cause I ain't got no time to play
When I ask you a question, answer is the lie where you lay
Lay where you die, never wake up die where you lay
It's hard to survive nigga or the high where you stay
I'm important like the Pope, I'm the king of New York
I'm live from South Central, I'm a Muslim on pork
Kurupt the world's fetish, they feen and scratch
I'm multiplied by twenty thousand fiends and crack
You add me to music and the fiends react
Everybody's addicted, turning bodies to liquid
I love your style but I hate your vibe
I don't want your wife but your bitch is mine
Murder methods of mayhem, tap or dap up the great
Arsenic rapper, sodium cacodylate
Wizardry, misery, young Merlin
She’ll love me, I make her walls fall like Berlin
You ever heard of a murderer, well you must of my nigga
I'm a mixture between Big, Snoopy and Jigga
I spit meat cleavers, I'm saucy as Picante
My wife's a diva like Beyonce but hood like Shante, motherfucker
I run amok on busters
They call me Kurupt, forget that, I fuck you up
I sizzle these motherfuckers in the inkling of a second, murder method
[Terrace Martin]
Ay yo, where my Compton homeboy at? Kendrick Lamar, haha, yeah

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Kurupt, let me erupt (what)
Like flammable gases under the Earth’s crust (uh)
My flammable passion can get the Earth crushed (what)
It’s 2012 once I unveil lyrics that can derail a train of a subway entrance
Say I bust like Jerome Bettis and that’s a must
Offended the best, magnum on my dick defending my flesh
Seven holes like a clarinet
Clarify your worthiness or foresee funeral services
Affirmative action pop up on your furnishing
Unfortunate future for us to fly free under God’s firmament
Me versus whosever’s dead, that’s God’s tournament
Kendrick the Arthritis, hand that hates to write this
What’s good, I’m in your hood like workers of Midas
Purpose is to be righteous
But my Malcolm X is extra’d out like a crip yelling his hood out when he fighting
I never seen a key, all I seen was a triton
I’m always kicking up dust, I’ve never been hiking
I’ve always had a licence for this hip-hop
Influenced by the rap that vocally said they killed cops
I’m riding on E with a bitch that pill pop
Now that’s the irony that I give you when the zip lock
Bag and sell it at doo wop, after that pass the doo wop
Lick a few shots for the few blocks that we on
For ain’t no beat that’s flawed or unique so please don’t try to Xerox
Copy written, niggas bitten
My style since I was backflipping
Inside canals, LA gears with the laces missing
Me Against the World in the background, mama had gave me bowl cut in the kitchen
Big cousin became a statistic, I chose the right flows and remained consistent
Voila, now they got me, haha
Expectations is high, Compton or Bed-Stuy
To them skinny niggas in the Chi bumping Common
But the only thing in common is crime and more violence
I play a little game, you say you fly, I’m over fly
I’m the pilot that’s left on the plane, cloud nine
That’s where I’m at with it
Punchlines till your jaw dented
Catapult your Buick till your car spinning
[Terrace Martin]
Watts up, Bad Lucc

[Verse 3: Bad Lucc]
Believe me, I’m Martin Luther and Jeezy
Hard to shoot and they need me
Created from a grain of sand that’s rolled up in a rizla
First time I met the RZA, I reminded him of GZA
Back then I was a cold little nigga painting pictures
Avalon did that, [?] six pack
Raised by them killers that’ll never bring them kids back
Tiny Archibald on the dirty side of law
I was inches from that building till my bitches tucked the raw, I’m lawless
Hell to the supreme, I should beam that beamer for gleaming
And blame it on that lean cause I’m leaning
The movie is rated R, [?] Shady, huh
Dick off his lady friends in a Bentley, huh
You ain’t seen us in a while, jack
Rastic, I’m god and a buggy is a mousetrap
You’ll become about that, big homies ain’t out yet
Youngins run the city or the biddy like I’m about that
Sharpen my tools, step out the kitchen homie
Young Drake from kitchen [?] told me that street shit is what they missing from me
Is so I’m outside with the Eastside
Sound of the piece and the heat flies
Flat fleece, the fleece bang when niggas get DP’d at beef time
Warren, no Griffin
You listen, you’ll be held accountable to what I’m spitting
I’m Johnny Cage with Timberlands mean I come with me
You got the blogs, I got the streets
I guess we even, not really
I’m cut from a different cloth, rappers pissing them off
Serving drinks out of gun stores, cocktails is Molotovs
I’m bored crazy in a booth, if I don’t get that coupe soon
I swear to God I’ll turn Hip-Hop Awards to a saloon
Move, make way for the fat kid with an attitude
If I batter you, I cook that last meal to faggot food, on mama’s dough
You sugar puffs and honor rolls
I’m angus like, Genghis Khan in my video
You can’t stop it though, from P.F. Changs to Pappadeaux
I eat a nigga up like Domino's, yeah
[Outro: Terrace Martin]
Yeah yeah, ay so there you have it
Terrace Martin
Kurupt, Young Gotti
Kendrick Lamar, Compton stand the fuck up
Bad Lucc, Watts stand the fuck up, you feel me
Crazy Toones, South Central, what up hood?
I’mma get the fuck outta here, man I’m done, man let the shit talk man

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, hey, hey
Get out of your own way, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Bono]
Love hurts
Now you're the girl who's left with no words
Your heart's a balloon, but then it bursts
It doesn't take a cannon, just a pin
Your skin's not covering
And resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous, the glamorous, the kiss
A fist, listen to this, oh

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

[Verse 2: Bono]
Fight back
Don't take it lyin' down, you got to bite back
The face of liberty's starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got a smack in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are lookin' for someone to lead them
The master's lookin' for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincoln's ghost said...

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Blessed are the arrogant
For there is the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
Like your pain



[Verse 1: Javonte (Kendrick Lamar)]
Sitting here thinking about how to get my money up today
Cause my change is looking a little strange
Maybe I should just go and rob a bank
(But I need money for the guns)
And my shoes kinda old so I can't be on the run
Need to climb up on a cool million
Cause a 9 to 5 just ain't an option

[Hook]
I need a get rich quick scheme
I need a get rich quick scheme
I'm trying to live the American Dream
But the odds are against me
I need a get rich quick scheme
I need a get rich quick scheme
I'm trying to live the American Dream
(Yeah I want it all)
But the odds are against me
(Trying to take over the world)

[Verse 2]
Empty envelopes deposited to the safe
Withdrawn as much as I could take
30 days late car no pass too
I'll park it somewhere else if it's what I gotta do
(And I got bills, bills, bills, bills, bills I can't afford)
1-800 numbers on my caller ID
Won't get a call 'til I hit the lottery

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tired of living pity broke
As I promise all the levies that was in in o (?)
I hit the bank to withdraw the tellers tell me in o'
I wanna have commas and live with common rich folk
You know the Oprahs and the Russells
With the hustle that can put me number six on the Forbes list
Ignore my troubles with a duffel [?]
Rick James screaming out, "I'm rich bitch"
But for now I'm just an average Joe
Drinking Kool Aid, boiling water, noodles on the kitchen stove
Gotta use them jumper cables just so my car can't get cut off
Every morning this is boring, you was touring, I was doing
Bad like Michael in the 80's with the curl [?]
Wishing I was balling out
Zipper open showing groins
Eating lobster looking proper [?] helicopter
But for now I gotta rob ya

[Hook]

[Skit]
You know I'm surgical with this bitch Jake
How you want it dawg?
Closed Casket?
Remember that fool in a wheelchair?
How you think he got there?

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got my air-conditioning on right now
Real cool about it
Oil talking please
Slick with it

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Wanna know what death feel like
I suggest that you stay in the house at night
The scope that I got for the long rifle fit pretty damn right
Plus my connect got a pretty good price
I could take off your neck with just one slice of the blade
No, I'm not Wesley Snipes
One cut can have her screaming out first aid
Been this way ever since first grade
Forte demeanour was to get paid
Birthday solution was to shoot straight
Thirteen I was ready for gunplay
Stand on the block taking pay
I get four shots like a freak oh he know
Not to fuck with K-D-O-T
Oh, I forgot
Never come around here without a Glock
You want beef with your boy
Nigga I put heat on your boy
Leave him tied up on the back seat
With your boy duct taped won't let out noise
Oh yes we got them toys
Oh yes we got them choppas
LAPD they can't stop us
Rockets shoot down helicopters
In the kitchen (in the kitchen)
Betty Crocker (betty crocker)
Got kick (got kick)
You hate (you hate)
You wait (you wait)
One sec (one sec)
I'll be back we then gon' west
No vest, I'ma aim at your face
Unless you can stop them
I'm so throwed
Oh yes people there is a problem
I say
[Hook: Z-Ro (kendrick lamar)]
(Know what I'm talking bout?
I can feel that lane
Sometimes I just lay back and let them look at me
I'm so [?] too
You see they be loving the oil talk
Its real slick for them
I keep the air conditioning on
Cool, cool, cool)

[Verse 2: Emjae]
Pop shots yeah we kill niggas
On the real nigga
Run when I flex the steel
Coming with a [?] to grill niggas
Save on the ounce but don't know the price
But I know one time ain't bust late night
Trying to set me up so I gotta think twice
Ain't no fucking with it I'ma let em plague mic
I keep a nine for you dummies then I split your brain
I'm going to your safe, take your cash, cocaine
All your weed in your range cause you're going platinum chains
And when I leave I [?] your white carpet got a stain
Watch as my city get gritty
Fuck pity, we gon' do you niggas shitty
Domino effect when we spray them with the semi
Big k-holes in your dodge you can hear me
Front to back
Stack for stack
Nigga go clip for clip
Either gat for gat (braaap)
Wise niggas better check my stacks
We let the match ratatat
And all the heads we crack
Stacked, lots of cheese
Tryna cop the gs
[?] mac sale when we pop the fees
Cop the keys
To the boss got rocks to feed
Roster fees
Cause ain't nobody stopping me
I got a flow so cold
Style so bold
A nigga run up, I leave his face all swole
Hit him with the 8 better yet with the 4
And I don't feel bad he put himself in the hole
West coast in motion
Promoting another episode
Down south them niggas get [?] whilst we be getting [?]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome me, come to me now
Help a king
I need assistance, I've been on hiatus
For ages and now I'm missing
My U.S. love
Yeah the home of the Beyonce's
Or the lease and Alicia Key to my place
Tango a la Congo, per se?

Straight up out the jungle and I"m feeling lonely
I'm going to the land where they got the milkin' honeys
So let's flip a coin, see which city we goin
L.A. or Miami, no matter long as it's sunny
It be cold in New York, I heat it up
Baby, strip, I'm blowing all of my bucks
Forget about Houston dough with the Houston flow
Purple swag and I'm moving slow
Circling a nigga named Prince
Cause he got all them Houston broads

Loving girls in America
I love them girls in America

Me and my driver will march all over your party
We crash up your club and we don't say sorry
We don't play with Arab money, we play with that safari
But you know I am a prince and I give a damn...hardly

We coming for them girls in the cities
You better tuck your girl or she'll come with me

[Kendrick Lamar]
This is Kendrick
I touch every city that I touch down, score
Endzone more
Rozay watch role play, 10-4
Tap that, baby, O.J., oh boy
Magnum glove, I'm sorry judge, but every pretty girl
Wanna fall in love, I'm Akeem, Prince of Zamunda
Shine like a jeweler
One railway from a high beam
They like me too
I am their type: crazy
ATL, NYC, AZ, MIA, LA
They say he turned up, you damn right
She 25, I call her life
I call her sex, you call her wife
And that ain't right, ya hurrd me?
Forgive me lord have mercy!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Baby got a nigga feeling like kid again
Make the homie wanna go and have a kid and then
Marry on an island probably on a private boat
Total silence while we gliding on Hawaii's coast
Body of a goddess
Brains of a Harvard student
Her intellect can intercept the brightest star moving
Hear the horns playing?
They playing for that girl
I ain't playing I plan to go around the world
Might settle down
Like fuck bitches
Call the homies up
I'm in love nigga
Can you believe that?
She gonna follow where my lead at high off life quit then relapse
You heat them horns playing?
They playing for that women
She think a nigga on
I think im on to something
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh
And so I ask my
How it feel to be with somebody that you define
As the perfect human that shaped under his design
God almighty
Golly you probably over-shadow sunshine
Man I feel sorry
For them hoes thats playing catch up inside the city
Or catching feelings when they hearing that you fucking with me
Or I'm fucking with you, that vise versa
I'm feeling it, you killing it where them big hearses
You hear them horns playing?
They playing for that diva
Im paying for that Rozy, im paying for that refeefa
Cuz this a celebation
Im seranating every occasion now peep my cadance
I break it down love
You break it down love
Then bring it back up
Fuck in front of the mirror break it till we get bad luck
You hear tham horns playing?
They playing for that queen
I think im really on
Cuz she on my team
[Outro]
In the beginning it always good
Until..[Chorus]
This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

[Verse 1]
Ever since a young man (Since a young man)
All I wanna be was a gunman (Was a gunman)
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol' up!
Don't judge me! My mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me! I was young, fuckin' all the brats
Don't judge me! Aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge! Don't judge me! Now my home got a Valley peak
Don’t judge me! If I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me! Won't you tell a friend? Y'all gon’ see—

[Chorus]
This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah

Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
[Verse 2]
Fuck is you talkin' to?
Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

[Bridge]
I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Asked for a piece of mind, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous
[Chorus]
This what God feel like
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
This what God feel like

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Delusional Thomas]
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty
Have no guideline
One day, four times
You don't mind that
I don't care (Pleasure)
Your divinity has turned me into a sinner
God is fair (Pleasure)
And your beauty can even make hell have a winter

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah
And a freak mind is divine, so we fuck from behind
On these sides, between thighs I eat up
Why do I do anything but trust myself?
Tried to give her up but she fuck so well
Man, that bitch so cold, man, that bitch so cold
I'ma take my time, I'ma hit that slow
'Cause I ain't in a rush young girl
You the only thing for me in this fucked up world
And do you believe in love?
Hold on tight when demons come
It'll be alright, no need to run
Stay with me tonight, we'll see the sun
And when we wake up early we'll still be young
Never felt this free before, I need you more
Than keys need doors, I need you sleepin' next to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take them all and keep you warm (Yeah)
And I teach her that we were the creatures of love
You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar
When I'm pullin' up in the Bimmer
The beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna fuck

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (Sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (Have no guideline)
One day, four times
You don't mind that
I don't care (Pleasure)
God is fair (Pleasure)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I need to feel your touch
You shy, you don't reveal too much
No lies, don't hide yourself at all
With you, I just can't help but fall
It's true, and I'll try everything
Girl you my sexy nasty, thing
She been getting faded all the time, flap your wings
I been getting stoned all week
It make me go too deep
Girl, you so lonely
Will you come home with me?
Just take your clothes off, babe
Know that we been talkin' on the phone all day
I love it when you tell me that you don't behave
Tell me when and where, I bet I won't be late
All I really wanna do is procreate
I'm a Superman, you'll be my Lois Lane
Know you late for work, you stayin' home today
We gon' keep on goin' 'til our bones both break
It's the grown folk way, yeah

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (Sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (Have no guideline)
One day, four times
You don't mind that
I don't care (Pleasure)
God is fair (Pleasure)

[Outro]
Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other, and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think "what a cute guy," and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...

So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.



[Part I: u]

[Intro]
Ah! Ah!

[Hook]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Verse 1]
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need you!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you
Made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear—

[Hook]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Bridge]
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too

[Skit: Jessica Vielmas]
House keeping
(Knocking)
House keeping
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Disculpe!

[Verse 2]
You the reason why mama and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love them
I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence?
Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple
You ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit
Or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas?
On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he would recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed"
You ain't try

[Part II: For Sale?]

[Intro: Bilal]
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
(Breathing)
What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too

[Hook]
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, "You crazy?"
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)

[Bridge]
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said, "Where's Ricardo?"
You said, "Oh, no, not the show"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit"
You said to me
I remember what you said too, you said
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this
But I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract if that’s possible"

[Hook]
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)



-- TIMELINE --
*** PART 1: U ***[Credits - 'U']
(1) Transitional Slide - 'U'

Scene 1: Screams
(00:00 - 00:30)
With the opening screams the audience can also sense that something is eerie; these sounds are in the original track combined creating a dangerous visual. Then beginning to see Kendrick pouring his heart out in to his liquor in a schizophrenic manner.


Scene 2: The Hotel Room
(00:30 - 01:26)
Hearing the chorus "Loving you is complicated" - the image starts to depict that there is an internal struggle going on with him loving himself. The scene is immensely minimalistic and filled with dark lighting, this accompanied by his throne like chair creates for a deep setting for imagery to take a place in the film.


Scene 3: Mirror
(01:27 - 01:57)
The mirror representative of an internal reflection; as the struggle of how he views himself as the words utter "I ****** tell you, you ****** failure—you ain't no leader!", the negatively intrinsic views we beginnings to see why he hates himself for the mistakes he has made.


Scene 4: Tipsy
(01:57 - 02:10)
Stumbling all over the place into his throne - blurred visions of the camera shaking around giving us  P.O.V. (Point of Vision) of what it is like to be overly intoxicated.


Scene 5: Room Service
The skit from 'u' begins to play before we hear the drunk Lamar entering in the next scene.











DialogueEffect on the Audience

(2) Transitional Slide - '8'

Scene 6 Part 1: Spinning Bottle
(02:37 - 03:42)
A very unique and a extremely interesting shot with a spinning bottle in the back ground seemingly to play spin the bottle by himself.
Notice this high angle shot focusing down on Lamar with a demonic reflection in the background of the mirror choosing to do it's own thing every now and then.



Scene 6 Part 2: Smashed Mirror
(03:30 - 03:42)
An easily missed technique of a reflection of himself breaking the mirror of reality down, smashing into pieces before the screen goes black into the next slide.



(3) Transitional Slide - 'Clearance sale: 100% off'*** PART 2: For Sale ***[Credits - 'For Sale']

Scene 1: The Dunk
(03:43 - 07:11)
A symbolistic baptism that takes Kendrick under thats meant to cleanse him from his impurities and sins of the night to be reborn again. This scene is a complete contrast from Scene 2 which compliments to criticism of the hip hop industry in "For Sale".

(4) Transitional Slide - 'Life is like a box of chickens'

(5) Transitional Slide - 'Instagram 2016: Dussy unlimited'

(6) Transitional Slide - 'If I blame you for a loss, I’ll be giving you all the credit'



(7) Transitional Slide - 'Good dussy can make you melt'

Scene 2: Lust
(04:03)
'Lucy's' temptations are all around Kendrick whether it's smoking weed, making him famous or filling his pockets with money these comparisons are depicted through the naked women in scene.



(8) Transitional Slide - 'Always trust a n**** with cornrows'

Scene 3: Lost/Distractions
(04:10)
It seems like Kendrick is trying to keep focus and maintain what is important to him, looking unaware and lost he is staring into the same place not noticing the women and putting aside these distractions.
(9) Transitional Slide - 'Time is change, your friend or foe'

(10) Transitional Slide - 'Never trust a n**** with too many haircuts'

(11) Transitional Slide - 'Tracee Ellis Ross is vibrant'

Scene 4: Demonic Eyes
(04:24 - 04:38)
Seducing Kendrick into these sinful acts seeming to illustrate a lucifer idea or connection - depicted through the lighting, eyes and the heads tilt provides an uncomfortable mood for the audience.

Scene 5: Upside Down
(04:39)
*Conscious speaking*

(12) Transitional Slide - 'I made money, I lost money, I did it again'

(13) Transitional Slide - 'Dussy salary cap'

(14) Transitional Slide - 'Water dawg'

(16) Transitional Slide - 'Night like this I wish that bomb head would fall'

Scene 6: Bridge
(05:59 - 06:09)
This scene makes little sense in the film and stands out like a sore thumb and really questions the audience about what is happening.



Scene 7: Trapped
(00:00 - 00:00)
How the industry strips you down for what you have got like strippers and take your money and keep you trapped in their vicious cycle.

(17) Transitional Slide - 'My tastebloods is expensive'

Scene 8: Waking up
(00:00 - 00:00)
*Waking up out of it? To reality since it can be so consuming like the big screen*
(18) Transitional Slide - 'You played the game, I pimped it'

(19) Transitional Slide - 'God is gangsta'

Scene 9: Drowning to being brought back
(00:00 - 00:00)
After the extended drowning.. longer time under sins.

Got they mind fucked up, they'd sell me their soul
Y'all niggas should already know, I got hoes boy

She like "Damn, how you do that stuff?"
I said "Don't worry, finish suckin' me up", oh fo' sho'
Aye [?], they better act like they know what's up

Oh yeah, I'm what people need
And I'm out of y'alls speed cause the flow got gas
Yeah, our shit be the bomb
My suggest, you get your pom poms and cheer

Fuck a pistol, let them niggas feel the K, man

You snakes, stay far from my home
Before I play Nelly and get my Desert Eagle on
Aim at your belly 'til you throw up your own shit
Thinkin' you the shit, face in the toilet
You wanna witness the livest nigga existin'
Then come and pay me a visit, you have to pay for admission
I'm on my mission to conquer my competition
My ego bigger than Jay-Z, for sure, not a maybe
I got the streets in a frenzy, dudes in the streets, they commend me
Don't try to creep, I got semis and best believe they will empty
Mix the juice with the Remy got me feelin' so damn tipsy
Just crashed in front of that Bentley, smokin' blunts the bitch with me
She takin' shots in my gymmy, couple back shots I got plenty
Tell her stop, she said gimme, y'all can see that I'm simply

Watts finest, and the Hub City's threat, lets go

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
On the table, I'm chopping rocks
My price is right, you could come on
Nigga, dimes n dubs
Just bring me your bucks
I'll hook you up with weed, dope or angel dust
My burner talk I'm goin'
To the block where the holdin' them
This place is popping 'till she put the chickens in the kitchen
Can't  sell dope forever, but I gotta make a living
Running your mouth it's goin'
Sold your soul, gotta get shot
Yeah, yeah the code of the streets
Never talk to police
Don't even talk dog
Forever hold your peace
Feds at ya door, it's goin'
Kicked in your door, get on the floor, get
They found all of your dope, now you gotta go
To the federal penitentiary dog, for ten or more
In the hood it's goin'
Rock's settin up shop is goin'
I got that ghetto white
Customers light your pipes
Come to the back door
I got what you like
I you know where it's at come
Rock and K. Dot will hold you (down), Tell 'em Dot
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar and (Jay Rock)]
If you want us come see us
Backdoor procedures
We got what you need
As our profit increases
Walking from Centennial, going home like
Straight down Central, got banged on
I ain't even have the pistol
If death was the issue
This shit, I guess it will be a sad song
So I'm thinking to myself like down
They bust a u-turn, so I know I'm goin'
I ain't no bitch or nothing
But if they just start jumping
I got no heat, so fuck it, I'ma start running
Before them shots come flying
Call my nigga Ralo like
Hold a nigga (down)
He ain't had no minutes
So a nigga just hopping fences
But if I do get popped, I hope he'll be a witness
But luckily he turned around
I got home like safe and sound
Now I'm back to the block
Where my uncle was [?] dishing off the rock
Stay ducking them cops
Cause you know they will lock a nigga
For them small grams, or them pounds
But they won't stop my profit
Or get in my pockets
(Even if it means a nigga gotta) sell narcotics
(We gonna hold shit)
(Open up shop across) town
Cause we gonna get this cream
No matter how hard it seems
We gonna do it together see were a team
(Rock)

[Intro]
I told 'em that the truth was comin' niggas
Hey Punch, cover me I'm goin' in

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to be sceptical about this rap shit
Now I'm a professional at this rap shit
Cause one verse can make the paralysed backflip
Don't compare guys to me, if Jesus could rap
They'd compare God to me, I'm special like that
I move like a freight train over these tracks
Run through you like wet doodle, that's what I'm doin'
Shittin' on niggas, perform bowel movements
Who you, you ain't up to par keeler
Nah keeler, you're word patterings is kinda off keeler
You ain't sick enough, you just a cough keeler
I bring pneumonia to California
Say hello to Mr. West now
Who's the best on the west now?
K.Dot, Jay Rock hands down
Anybody that feel different
You die first class on a cemetery visit, keeler

[Bridge]
Keep it runnin' Punch
I told niggas the truth is comin' man
Hey Top put a couple houses on your boy man
I got your shit right here

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so far ahead of my time
I'm 'bout to start my third life
Shit I feel like I've died already twice
Then reincarnated and become your unborn grandchild's favourite
I got three brains to play with
I'm so far ahead of my time
I gotta say this shit again
But this time I came back
Double time, rebirth as a twin
Feet first I'm a mother smooth
Like deja vu, times two, now
You could probably dodge a bullet
But see we put your body parts in shopping carts
Till them bums push it
You on the edge nigga don't push it
'Fore the fifth turn you head crooked
I sit your monkey ass down
And best believe, it won't be on no damn cushion
A casket full of thorn bushes
Move the shit while the fiends look
Call the cops, shush
[?] trying to cock me
You fight the case better off the street
Daddy glove boxin, left hook the judge
Cap the jury up
You walkin' out with a Jefferson strapped
Like, if I come back, so what
It's a fact I rap like every second I gotta throw up
Ouch, spit shit like dookie mouth
Pull out the drop, six whenever your bitch out
We put her on the ave, like cabs and bus route
We put you on the couch, ice cream with your face pout
Watchin' Oprah, wonderin' if she ever come back over
Nah homie she at the crib, makin' her feet touch her shoulders
I'm in her ribs like, hey what's up
She in my closet talkin' bout how much these cost
Don't worry 'bout it, just make sure you tell your girls about it
You know Kelly, Kim, Sherry and Shirley 'bout it
Mama, you can see you fucking with a boss
Look at my kicks, you could see how much these cost
Look at my teeth, yeah ma, gold no floss, yeah
We still doin' it baby
Top Dawg we keep doin' it baby
I'm a boss nigga

[Outro]
This shit is fuckin' fond of me, Punch man
I tell motherfuckers the truth is comin' man
It's so fuckin' real man
Oh man
It's like a routine
When I step on the scene
Pack a [?] full of lean

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Niggas always talk about how many cars they got
Where I'm from [?] might get you popped
Cause these [?], they don't give a fuck about nothing

Mass hallucination, baby

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: "What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: "Lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: "He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city."

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby

This is your station, baby

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby



The first sound we hear on good kid, m.A.A.d. city is a prayer: "Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving us with your precious blood," voices murmur, evoking a family dinner gathering. The album's cover art, a grubby Polaroid, provides a visual prompt for the scene: Baby Kendrick dangles off an uncle's knee in front of a squat kitchen table displaying a 40-ounce and Lamar's baby bottle. The snapshot is such an unvarnished peek into the rapper's inner life that staring at it for too long feels almost invasive. This autobiographical intensity is the album's calling card. Listening to it feels like walking directly into Lamar's childhood home and, for the next hour, growing up alongside him.

Lamar has subtitled the record "A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar", and the comparison rings true: You could take the album's outline and build a set for a three-act play. It opens on a 17-year-old Kendrick "with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental," driving his mother's van to see a girl named Sherane. As his voice darts and halts in a rhythm that mimics his over-eager commute, Lamar explores the furtiveness of young lust: "It's deep-rooted, the music of being young and dumb," he raps. The song is interrupted by the first of several voice mail recordings that delineate the album's structure: Kendrick's mother, rambling into his phone and pleading for him to return her car. These voicemails appear through the record, reinforcing that good kid, m.A.A.d city is partly a love letter to the grounding power of family. In this album's world, family and faith are not abstract concepts: They are the fraying tethers holding Lamar back from the chasm of gang violence that threatens to consume him.

All this weighty material might make good kid, m.A.A.d city sound like a bit of a drag. But the miracle of this album is how it ties straightforward rap thrills-- dazzling lyrical virtuosity, slick quotables, pulverizing beats, star turns from guest rappers-- directly to its narrative. For example, when "Backseat Freestyle" leaked last week, its uncharacteristic subject matter ("All my life I want money and power/ Respect my mind or die from lead shower") took some fans by surprise. But on the album, it marks the moment in the narrative when young Kendrick's character first begins rapping, egged on by a friend who plugs in a beat CD. Framed this way, his "damn, I got bitches" chant gets turned inside out: This isn't an alpha male's boast. It's a pipsqueak's first pass at a chest-puff. It's also a monster of a radio-ready single, with Kendrick rapping in three voices (in double- and triple-time, no less) over an insane Hit-Boy beat.

Lamar grew up in Compton, and ghosts of West Coast gangsta-rap haunt this album's edges, casting shadows on Kendrick's complicated relationship with his hometown. When "The Art of Peer Pressure" brings Kendrick and his friends to Rosecrans Ave., the music downshifts into menacing G-funk mode as a salute to hallowed ground. Ice Cube’s “Bird in the Hand” is invoked to set up “m.A.A.d city” (“Fresh of out school, 'cause I was a high-school grad..."), which appropriately marks the moment when real violence erupts. Here, Kendrick sounds like a terrified kid: "I made a promise to see you bleeding," he raps, his voice pitched at a pleading, near-hysterical sob. In response, the voice of Compton's Most Wanted rapper MC Eiht leers, "Wake yo' punk ass up," like a father figure of the Darth Vader variety.

Which brings us to the album's most visible benefactor and most unsettled presence: Dr. Dre. In recent months, Dre has availed himself of the fresh-career oxygen Kendrick's rise has pumped into his atmosphere, lumbering out of his corporate airlock to stand with Lamar on magazine covers. But the role he plays in Lamar's story feels muddled and unresolved. On an album that manages to seamlessly work a smirking Drake and a highly recognizable Janet Jackson sample ("Poetic Justice") into the fabric of a larger narrative, it is only Dre's appearance, on the final track "Compton", that feels like an uneasy outlier.

"Compton" is the victory lap, the coronation. Coming after the stunning 12-minute denouement "Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst", in which Lamar delivers a verse from a peripheral character that is the album's most dazzling stroke of empathy, it can't help but be a small deflation. The moment of arrival in any artist's story is always less interesting than their journey, and there's a disconnect in hearing Lamar and Dre stunt over Just Blaze's blaring orchestral-soul beat. Dre's music is part of the landscape that Kendrick grew up in but his actual appearance has a certain Truman Show feel to it.

But the true ending of good kid, m.A.A.d. city takes place at the end of the previous song, "Real", which represents the spiritual victory that the album's story has thrashed its way towards. Finally grasping that "none of that shit"-- money, power, respect, loving your block-- "make me real," Lamar embraces what does, as his parents put the album's central concerns to bed: "Any nigga can kill a man," his father admonishes. "That don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family." And his mother: "If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man... Tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton... When you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement. And that's the best way to give back to your city. And I love you, Kendrick."

[Intro]
Good morning, America (Ahh)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
The saga continues
Good morning, America (Ahh)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
[?]
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
A new revelation
Good morning, America (Ahh)

[Verse 1]
Good morning, America
A new day, we gotta hit the schedule ahead of us
The letter K, D-O-T, add a space like a Microsoft keypad
You can't see me, invisible ski mask
Poke the eyes out my beanie
Ghetto Zorro on the headlines, I leave
Feces, shit on niggas, nigga
My flow come in plural
Multiple of it, majority love it
I got the masses, meaning societies, public
Low Dickie shorts, L.A. fashion still holding grudges
Ain't forgot y'all killed Pac, niggas
Ain't forgot y'all left the West Coast for dead
Tried to play it off like the paramedics was coming
Instead, we dusted off, pulled the bullet out our heads
Left a permanent scar for the whole world to recognize
California, economics, pay your taxes bitch
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast to wake up to, Nate

[Chorus]
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right

[Verse 2]
Oh, you done fucked up, baby
Young Kendrick, the grown up baby
On enough to acknowledge your fuck ups
Maybe I spare your life, maybe I won't
Maybe I give you the funk
Geroge Clinton, bring my sentence like I got a English major in it
This is higher academics, pay attention, students
Niggas, what was you foolin' with a handgun?
Might as well have a harpoon, then
I carry two or more with me like I'm carpoolin'
We mile deep when it's beef
I don't say "get 'em," I say "move in"
S.W.A.T team so aggressive, turn a minor problem extreme
Kool-Aid red beam on top of my weapon
Notice my professionalism, I'm perfecting my craft
You niggas is half doin' your job, insubordination
I'mma have the boss get you fired
Oh, I am the boss
Get terminated, bitch
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast, don't wake up too late

[Chorus]
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right

[Verse 3]
The moral is try your best to not collide with the best of 'em
I ain't talkin' 'bout you, I talk about Jay, Nas, and him
Crème de la crème, homie
Pockets fat, hand boney
How is that?
Kinda ironic, the West Coast, I underline it
Make him my priority, in orderly fashion, I ain't livin' in
Nobody lasted in time, nobody closing your blinds
The sun is shining, bitch
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast, don't wake up too late

[Chorus]
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right

[Outro]
My nigga, hahahaha
Roll your window down, start there
Ahahaha
See, you gotta hear the street
You gotta be snortin', you know
You gotta taste that shit, feel that
Learn that shit, brotha
Learn that shit, that shit will get you killed
These mothafuckas plottin' all kinds of shit behind your back
Shit

[Hook]
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off

[Verse 1: Reek Da Villian]
Blowin Cubanas in Honda Sonatas with Madonnas
As she do the honors to shine and polish my anaconda
I'm at the Ramada like Tony Montana with my llama
Countin' Angelatas, sippin' pina colada cavadas
These giuliani illuminati, my super shotty
These dudes'll try me with Deuteronomy, my Ruger body
And my True Armani's, I'm prolly with a new crew of mami's
'Bout to make a punani tsunami in a blue Bugatti
Flow's phenomenal, money on amadu
Diablo chronicles, rap from Elvis Presley's abdominal
Niggas is comical, tryna pair up with the shit I'ma do
Gravity rappin' fall on deaf ears, I'm astronomical
Like a jungle, sometimes that makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, survivin' all of these summers
And runnin' from gunners, hoppin' out Hummers with Stevie Wonders
That don't even look at who they be shootin' when they be dumpin'

[Hook]
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I slay a nigga with no conscience, I'm so Compton
I know your confidence, you're incompetent, that's a compliment
Any continent, I can construct atomic condiments
I'm not a Communist, rather govern my own accomplishments
Livin' in turmoil boils my temper
Tempurpedic'll burn if you sleep on me, nigga
Jimmy crack corn and Kendrick can crack the horns
Of a dragon and toss 'em inside of a bush full of thorns
Taggin' along, get you thrown on side of your lawn
Throw a molotov, I toss, catch it like a baton, boss
Acquire many choirs for your funeral
Be quiet before I stand over you like a urinal
Mark a bullet wherever your latest rapper tattoo'll go
Your crew'll know I split you 'til you was two adults
Siamese, I sneeze and bless tracks
You a bitch on menopause, I ain't gotta pause that
Bitch

[Hook]
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Okay now boom shakalaka, Mr. Know-I-Got-A-Lotta
Talkin' dollars, Gucci, Louis, Prada, hundred 'round the collar
Hop up out of that new foreign auto, with the latest model
Tell the waiter bring the bottles, I be stuntin' so they follow
This a treat, and I'm finna feast, why they send the beat?
Come and see, Hannibal the beast, murder, third degree
I assassinated, flow abominated, know they highly hated
Look how it's orchestrated, hottest nigga underrated
They stealin' flows, got these rappers so intimidated
New flow, new dough, boy you outdated
I'm just gettin' started, they ain't seen nothin' yet
Wait 'til my new drops at the projects
See my sneaks, they ain't comin' into stock yet
Got the whole hood hooked, no Pyrex
Stay tuned, rose gold on the Rolex
I'm the best, nigga, period - Kotex

[Hook]
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Midwest, where you at?
Dirty South, where you at?
And anywhere you from
It's where you at, right now
It's that time again
It's that time again

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah

[Verse 1]
7-1-3
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm ridin', why they on me?
Why they on me? I'm flyin', sippin' low-key
I'm sippin' low-key in Onyx, rider, rider

[Chorus]
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (Straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (It's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah

[Verse 2]
When I'm pullin' up right beside ya
Pop star, lil' Mariah
When I text a cute game, wildness
Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah
We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah
Oh no, I can't fuck with y'all
Yeah, when I'm with my squad I cannot do no wrong
Yeah, saucin' in the city, don't get misinformed
Yeah, they gon' pull up on you (Brr, brr, brr)
Yeah, we gon' do some things, some things you can't relate
Yeah, 'cause we from a place, a place you cannot stay
Oh, you can't go, oh, I don't know
Oh, back the fuck up off me

[Chorus]
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time



[Intro]
Yeah we gone keep it moving man
Your man DJ Skee holdin' it down
With my man Jay Rock
Next fuckin' superstar of the West Coast
Remember where you heard it first
You can tune in to him, on my radio show
You know we always playin' his shit
Saturday nights, Channel 40
Hip-Hop nation, satellite radio, let's go

[Hook: Jay Rock]
It ain't nothing for a soldier to bleed
Takes a real gangsta to squeeze (real talk)
Only the strong survive, you see
Plus the strong don't cherish the weak (gotta have heart)
It ain't nothing for a soldier to bleed
Takes a real gangsta to squeeze (real talk)
Only the strong survive, you see
Plus the strong don't cherish the weak (gotta have heart)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Pull up in the whip, identical black
Two bitches inside, identical racks
Two guns on my side, identical gats
Leave a nigga bleeding fast in need of a pad
Look, when a nigga broke, in need of some cash
I'll hit a house fast, with the heat and a mask
All fingers on triggers, itching to blast
Everybody on the floor, yelling "Where's the stash?"
[?] then I'm out split second to dash
Swerving through enemy lines might bust me a cap
Then I pull the car over throw the strap in the trash
Make sure the coast's clear, no signs of the crash
Only the strong survive, when I speak it it's real
Dawg it's real on this field, get killed for the skrill
Got ice on your hand, get killed for your chill
Killer Cali you bastard, keep you a steel

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Pull out the Aston Martin
If you talking too much pull out my coffin
Pull out another one for his brother
Real comfortable, even get his favourite colour
I burn rubber off the V12
I fuck international females
My last bitch bitch was speaking some German shit
Catch me vacating on the Germany trip
Eyes red, sandals on like, fuck what Cam'ron said
I'm pecking for the bread
But nothing like a pigeon
I'm something like a vulture
You wanna know how I do it mothafucka I'll coach ya
They call me Phil Jackson
I train your day like Denzel, welcome to practice
Yes I'm the baddest, if my lyrics had looks
This rhyme right here belong in the beauty pageant
J. Brown asked me do I got it, been had it
This beat is pornographic
I fuck off it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Wy]
Enemy down, left his ass spread apart
Trying to get back to the whip, fuck it won't start
Now I'm on foot back to the turf
Disguised in these colours of this nigga I murked
Hide in the bush, hit the bitch on the chirp
This where I'm at, don't let the ones get here first
So as she pulled up, I jumped in the Magnum
Took my clothes off and burned 'em, after I bagged 'em
I shoot shots through your new era
Have your face airbrushed on a all white new sweater
Before the judge say you're [?]
I'm jumping out, dumping, let him kill me in a stand off
Please [?], take me away
At least back behind the car I fire back with the K
That's what it is, fire back where you stay
I spent my whole life trying to climb back with the yay



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the type of nigga that get sexy on a bitch

Put respect up on my name, ho, I'm heavy in this bitch, yeah

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]

And I'm feelin' like the hand of God blessed me in this bitch
Put respect up on my name, ho, I'm heavy in this bitch
I just won seven Grammy's, girl, you gotta fuck me
And I got a song with Beyoncé, you love me?
Poppin' wheelies on the freeway, I'm a stuntman
Got the city goin' crazy, look at what you done man
We just havin’ fun man, T-O-P the gun man

Starin’ at a dead president, they be talkin' to me, but look

One thing I can't stand is a messy lil’ bitch
And a lotta y'all niggas undercover male groupies

[Chorus: Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar]
Doing what I want, yeah, I'm filthy

I'm the type that get sexy on a bitch
Put respect up on my name, ho, I'm heavy in this bitch, yeah
Handsome, say she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm handsome

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Big chillin' with my foolies and we all cool
Hit 'em with the whole foolie, we don't argue
You ain't hoppin' out on the mission, man, that's awful
You ain't countin' money, checkin' chicken, man, that's awful
And I got a car full of them female fossils
Lil' baby actin' fool with it, take a jaw full
I be drippin' sauce too, I done took a loss too
I done fell on my pocket, that's just what a boss do
Ain't nothin' to a full-time player on the deep end
Always on the deep end, I'm ballin' on the deep end
My acebooncoon say they callin' on the deep end
I'ma pledge to this whole dollar with allegiance
But I'ma get sassy on a bitch
Hit 'em with the wam-bam, break a levy on a bitch, yeah
I lift my shirt up, then I do my dance
I can manage for the cameras somehow

[Chorus: Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar]
Doing what I want, yeah, I'm filthy
I'ma flex hard 'til it kill me
Handsome, say she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm handsome
I'm the type that get sexy on a bitch
Put respect up on my name, ho, I'm heavy in this bitch, yeah
Handsome, say she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm handsome

24/7, 365, Kendrick Lamar is always right on time

Oh, you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horse's mouth, you'll never understand me

I told you the plan B was to win your hearts before we win a Grammy

These days ain't shit changed, different toilet - same shit
And I drunk a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has beens

Had it been for my past tense I wouldn't be rappin'

But now I'm here, GQ, man of the year

[Verse]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, [bump] your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, you know that it's big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You know you're evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real higga

[Interlude]
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Trap our bodies but can't lock our minds
Everybody just stop
(The bigger I shoot)

[Hook: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that

[Interlude]
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Lock our body, can't trap our mind

[Part II: Alright]

We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be a-

[Verse 1]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty women and women, and it's the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Everything I know, karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
Tell em' other gangsters silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Hook]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, down before
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world, "Where do we go?"
I'm at the preacher's door
They wanna kill us dead, at the preacher's door
We said give 'em some more
This one time, do it fo' sho
But we gon' be alright

[Hook]
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright (hello)
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright (P!)
We gon' be alright (hello)
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
What you want, you a house, you a car?
Acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
You can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can smell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Diggin' in my pocket, candy paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I'm black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with...
God

[Part III: Untitled 5]

[Verse]
It's been a week already
Feeling weak already
Got me at peak, possibility of what could be
Situation is heavy, I've got to prove
On February twenty sixth I lost my life too
It's like I'm here in a dark dream
Nightmare, hear screams recorded
Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
Why didn't he defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch?
And for our community do you know what this does?
Add to a trail of hatred
Twenty twelve was taped for the world to see
Set us back another four-hundred years
This is modern day slavery
The reason why I'm by your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumps into your arms
Cut off the engine then sped off in a Wraith
I'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk
Had the vodka on the top
How come I can long time
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
See I'm living with anxiety
Giving up sobriety
Cussing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice ain't free
Therefore justice ain't me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinking by myself
At the end of Section Park
Caught you when you walk besides your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumps into your arms
The engine then sped off in a wraith
I said Hiiipower, one time you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us

I don't need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack
Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime
Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watt's finest
Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?
(Jay Rock: Give me a minute my nigga let me go find 'em)
Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Screaming, "Fuck the world" with a capital F
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
That's number one, cause second is the first loser
Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop
Top Dawg Entertainment: Presents K-Dot

[Intro]
Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (Yeah)
Sayin’ I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin’ dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause, damn it, I'm still the
[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
So you sold ten million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? (Haha! Wait)
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, "DIE ANTWOORD!"
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the
[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Brr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day (Hey!) I'm gonna be the
[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest[Intro]

[Verse 1: Jay Rock and (Lea)]
24 inch rims, sittin' on in the drop
Catch his ass at a light, with a four-five cocked
Got a look at his chain, damn it look at his watch
That's sixty g's a piece, you could go re-cop
Nigga give me your jewels, and nigga hand me the rock
If you don't co-operate I'll leave your brains on this block
Woah man, this a nice piece, Oh, so icy
Oh, wrong move, face on the white tee
Gimme your keys and nigga hand me your wallet
Nigga empty your pockets before I cock it and pop it
Tell 'em honey
(he didn't know we was creepin')
(The icy jewels yeah we need them)
Look at his teeth, he got ice in his grill
We can pawn that shit and come up with some skrill
When you see this steel that means hand me your bills
And if you throw up a fight, you'll get popped like pills
Nigga

[Hook: Lea and (Jay Rock)]
He flossin' for you daddy (What you talkin' bout?)
Homie with the grill (Homie with the what?)
Yep, the grill, here goes the steel

He flossin' for you daddy (What you talkin' bout?)
Homie with the grill (Homie with the what?)
Yep, the grill, here goes the steel
(I'ma rob his ass blind tell him give me them bills)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What it do homie?, it's your young boy god given
Your unnecessary spending show how you're living
Them diamonds in your grill won't you take 'em out
'Fore I pistol whip your jaw and spank 'em out your mouth
I'll show 'em what a real hijack's about
Take everything scrape the change from under the couch
Platinum to rose gold, it's gettin' sold
Whatever's left the dentist figure it out
Put the hog to 'em or trick em out
Watch me barge through 'em like rottweilers and pitbulls
We ain't ate yet, and you lookin' fools
17 shots in the clip got the chamber full
Bang, yeah, you're looking kinda right
Now it's time to say goodnight, so glad that you came
Bang, one more just because you made my trigger finger sore
Now, give me diamond rings

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Bash and (Punch)]
It's Bash, click clack put the heat to his grill
Open wide, that's ice nigga bite the steel
(We supposed to be brothers)
Pussy nigga what you trying to kick knowledge
Smack 'em with the burner, empty your pockets
(What it do? It's young hot
From the bottom, out of Watts
Where they settin' up shop they ain't talkin' to the cops
If you want it then they got it
Niggas hungry and they plottin'
Come through keep it pushin' cause the streets is watchin')
Yeah, you know what time it is, gimme your watch
My gun's already hip-hop, don't make it go pop
Take your men up to catch these punchlines
For only one second, catch a bullet eat your flesh like it's lunchtime
(The ice froze on his neck, that's a fabulous thing
Put in on a milk carton like it's fabulous chain
Them Cali boys insane, homie guard your grill)
[Outro: Jay Rock]
I'ma rob his ass blind, tell me give me them bills[Produced by Tae Beast]

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
(Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga)
Where are we going, we should be slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
We don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what it said to me, but the place I call ambition
Now dead to me, gone and forgotten, I’m off track
Like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him, nah
[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven's unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil
Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight
[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we’re always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
I think we’re getting closer[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
Where are you going now?
Why are you slowing down?
Why, why, why?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Where are we going?
Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going?
We should be growing now!

[Bridge: Jhené Aiko]
Try and visualize how to get it right
But my vision's so blurry
Tryna slow it down
Take us to the ground
But were always in a hurry now!
And if I could make this world spin a little slower
Then I would, and we could grow a little closer
I think we’re getting closer

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Where are we going?
(Closer, closer, closer)
Why are we slowing?
We think we’re getting closer
Where are you going?
(Closer, closer, closer)
We should be growing now
Where are we going?
(Closer, closer, closer)
Why are we slowing?
We think we’re getting closer
Where are you going?
(Closer, closer, closer)
We should be growing now
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
So in conclusion
Sometimes we lose focus
Planning our whole demise
We’re getting the big picture and making it the wallet size
So to what's important in my life, I apologize
I hope to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted
The question is would you bounce back, or bounce back wards?
You wouldn’t know how to act or would you take action?
That's just a part of life and if your vision's impaired
You'll probably lose it all tonight

[Verse 2: Hope]
What’s going on Marvin, dearly departed?
Young Marta, Bar or Parker
Upon them all upon mighty days
But sweet alcoholic nights are feeling faraway
Son can only Skype with his pop, stop
He’s only feeling love from his mom
Got rocks in my stomach
I can feel my soul bleed, self-love
But I never want my son to be me, holla at me
So I pray until I feel it’s not working
I’m a showman on the surface
Either way, it’s perfect
You ever feel like the purpose ain't worth it?
Well I do, I’m the poster child for young fathers working
I swear to god I wanna be free
And he just wanna be me
And I just wanna be him
I’m jealous and discreetly
I’m one of your own
I’m trying to raise a child
Still trying to raise me right now
Where am I gone?
[Bridge: Jhené Aiko]
Try and visualize how to get it right
But my visions are blurry
Trying to slow it down
Stay close to the ground
But we were always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower
Then I would, and we could grow a little closer

[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
Where are we going?
Why?
Why are you going?
Why are we growing apart?
We should be growing together?
Right?

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & [?]]
Previously
How the hell you gonna tell that man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Brady, where's your gun at? *Gunshots*

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & [?]]
Now kill yourself
Why'd you say that?
'Cause that's the American way plus it was fun
Man, you a damn jack-
-ass I know everyone wanna make me the scapegoat
Like your the greatest of all time
Fuck you
Asshole
Let's stop the bickering
That's the last time you see me ignorant
So you can kill the thrills of thinking we're not different
Yeah, yeah, you're embarrassed aren't you?
Couldn't control your arsenal
Maybe the next time I'm persuading you, jump in the car pool
So what's your answer?
Man you must have [?] your cracker
Oh no, another white joke, I'm laughing, how original?
You're asking for me to be on the shit that you on
Yeah, we can start with this cat named G Malone *Static*

[Interlude]
"Meet G Malone, a west coast recording artist that's destined for stardom, but acknowledging the false hopes that lie within the music industry, he ponders the thought of going back to drug distribution. Feeling unsure of this decision (DJ rock star
Exclusive)..."

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & [?]]
Hey G, remember me?
It's yo' conscience
You know, the voice in yo head that never had fed your nonsense?
I know your getting famous and rather lifestyle is changing
But tell the truth
The music biz isn't what it seems, ain't it?
Don't listen to em G
Keep putting Watts on the map
Fuck that
You been gettin' money way before rap
I say you go back hustlin'
Gather some sherm, pack, and a black magnum
Through Wyatt's mad dog and a pit bull if it watched
Stop, no need to be moving backwards
Besides, your future brighter than half of these rappers
So what's the point of going back to the drug side?
'Cuz everybody knows that G's certified
What the fuck, you dumb as fuck
Oh, what, you jealous fool?
Cuz I know Malone, Keke Loc', and his brother Pool
Plus the Seventh Street-
Man you ain't nothin' but bad bitch
Aye, Malone, if your with it lemme get an ad-lib (yeah)

[Interlude]
"Meet Jay Rock, former quote unquote 'Menace to Society', now Warner Brothers recording artist dealing with the sudden uncertainties of even having his first official single released. He finds himself struggling, daily to overcome the temptations triggering his old criminal ways.  At this moment, his conscience comes into play..."

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & [?]]
Watt's finest
I told G he wit it
He said he bout to go OT
Forget it
I won't let you fuck up Watt's career
Woah, calm down
Somebody's getting sensitive here
You fucking right because you know Jay Rock is my favorite
Man you got a song with Lil Wayne and still ain't made it
Plus you just had a baby
So I know that shit is stressin'
Know how much pampers cost ya
We live in a recession
I suggest you rob tomorrow
Whatever in sight, whatever you like
And if that bitch resists tell that bitch goodnight
Like that's gon' make a difference
I know it will
What, prison?
I'm just sayin' what he like to do best
What?
Stealin', robbin', jacking guys for nice cars
Like the nigga did in 17
Did you say nigga?
It was a joke you know what I mean
I mean, I hope you know what I mean
Why you mad?
You're acting mean
I mean, you said the same thing earlier
What the fuck you worried for?
I thought we was a team man
You trippin' man
You glitchin'
You don't get it
You was right
You are different
You fuckin' right
Why the hells you gotta fuck with the future of Watts?
Okay, okay
Lets see the choice he makes before his album drops *Static*



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
What I look like, a sucker to you, nigga?
Fuck you, rookie
Somethin' incredible, heh-heh-heh

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Turn that shit up, boy, bump that shit
Nigga, hold a handgun and dump that shit
Nigga, buy that borough and fuck that bitch
And kick her out before the sun come up
Nigga, my funds is up
I got my money right
Business movin' like New York City lights
Bitches all over that boy
Cause they know that young boy got a cold strut
But I don't fuck with them hood rats, they'll set you up
And I ain't goin' out just like that
I'd rather go out over a shoot-out, plow
Land of the scandalous, every corner got a candle lit
Every stop sign got a hollow tip
Every sunshine got a hood under it
And you know we Marilyn Jones runnin' that shit
My bones made out of cement, strong arm
Explode on y'all, Vietnam, boom

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Heh-heh-heh, okay, I'm ready, ha-ha

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell your boyfriend to do it like this
A thousand for the jeans, three hundred for the kicks, bitch
I was born with diamonds in my wrist
So, it's only right for your boy to talk shit, yuck
Straight nasty, don't walk past me
I just might grab it, just might pull a blade out and stab it
I would kill it only if you say
I'm more than willin' to take advantage
Legs to the ceilin', ho, throw away your panties
Tell 'em that we chillin' if your boyfriend harassin'
I take 'em, then I perform magic
Head on the freeway, seatbelt fastened
And go and tell the DJ to play my shit
You never heard nothin' like this, yuh
The new West Coast's best-kept secret
Chronic smoke comin' out my throat, ha-ha

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Shit, ay, ay, heh-heh, fuck it, I'm goin' in

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
They say, "Who that?" K. Dot, no roof, new top
They hate, they watch, speed down the block
In a Porsche Box, stashbox, got a new Glock
In a shoot-out with anybody that you got
.45, no lie, no problem
If he got his jewels on, I'm a Black Rob him
Nigga, I'm a bad boy, I'm a black ski mask, boy
I'm a run in his house, then ask, "Where the cash, boy?"
"Tell me where the safe or this'll be the last time
That you ever have a gun in your face"
Might be the last time that somebody run in your place
You picked a bad time to be at fuckin' home today, stupid
I'm ruthless, I'm Eazy-E, I'm Snoop, shit
I'm 2Pac, I'm inferno, I'm so hot, no chicken
Tell it to the Colonel Sanders, do it for that Compton campus

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Heh-heh, I'm done with the fourth quarter
Shit, psych, Rock, get 'em

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Guess who's back? Fresh new fitted, turned back
Fresh new spinners on the 'Lac
Never knew Rock could do it like that
I'm a mack for real, I hit more pussy than Vagisil, yeah
Who got this game in a chokehold?
We'll make your best rapper submit
Pack up and quit cause we the shit
Plus, that Calico hold more shells than El Pollo Loco
Turn you to a dough salt
Take your ho to the mo-mo quick
She want to bounce up and down on my pogo stick
Me n' Dot spit raw, deejays,  Mr. Miyagi
Your records wax us on and wax you off, ha
You come frontin', get slammed like Onyx
We the West Coast classics, you better pay homage
You want problems? The kings of the shoot-outs
Leave your block smokin' like a luau
Top Dawg E-N-T, bitch

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
We told you, heh-heh-heh, we told you, ah
Top Dawg, nig, we told you, nigga done did it
Yeah, yeah, aye



[Verse 1: SiR]
I been goin' silly for the Westside (Westside)
You might catch me rollin' where the reps ride (Real reps, real reps, real reps)
Ain't no opposition, I'm the best, right? (Yeah, yeah)
I might take my city on a test drive (Test drive)
You don't wanna see me on a good day (Oh no, oh no)
You don't wanna see me on a bad day (No, no, no, oh no)
I was just a nigga with some hoop dreams (Hoop dreams)
Now, I'm in the league, bitch
Now, I'm in the lead, bitch
I can slam dunk but I just layup (I just layup, ayy)
Smokin' marijuana 'til I, ooh (Ooh), what? (What?) wake up
May not understand me 'cause it's all real (I'm all real, all real)
And I don't really give a damn how y'all feel (No, no)

[Chorus: SiR]
Baby, I'm just tryna let my hair down (My hair down)
Baby, I'm just tryna let my hair down (My hair down)
Everybody's watchin', I'm aware now (I'm aware now)
But I can't find a reason I should care now (I should care now)
Baby, I'm just tryna let my–

[Post-Chorus: SiR]
If I take off my cool, do you promise to stay?
If I give you my heart, would you throw it away?
Do you mean what you say when you tell me you love me?
Do you really?
Do you really?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Itty-bitty bitch is a numerologist
Got your number where I live
I'ma get you outta pocket like a quarterback blitz
That's a everyday faucet, make it wet, make it rinse
Skeletons in your closet but your past don't exist
Got a pad on your list, got a pad on your lock
Calabas' ain't the move, that's where everybody live
Plus the mountain is hot, you forgot what you got, ah!
Hol' up, nuisance (I say it, I say it, I say it)
I recommend 'em all with acoustics (I say it, I say it, I say it)
I recommend a bed for the juices (I say it, I say it, I say it)
I recommend you live where the truth is (I say it, I say it, I say it)
Psychedelic views and infinity pools, yeah, checking out
Once I sweat them edges out
Hair down like vanity
I got the fuck-ups, I got the damage fees
I got the gold dust, I got the anesthesia
When you chose up, this ain't a fantasy
We 'bout to go up, see underhanding me never got no love
But understandin' me maybe can mold us and–

[Chorus: SiR]
Baby, I'm just tryna let my hair down (My hair down)
Baby, I'm just tryna let my hair down (My hair down)
Everybody's watching, I'm aware now (I'm aware now)
But I can't find a reason I should care now (I should care now)
Baby, I'm just tryna let my–

[Post-Chorus: SiR]
If I take off my cool, do you promise to stay?
If I give you my heart, would you throw it away?
Do you mean what you say when you tell me you love me?
Do you really?
Do you really?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Reach my surroundings when I move out cause dudes envy
Something like Prince Akeem 2 in the semi
Super soak ya, anti-social, for the mail I'll go postal
Postpone your post put it on pause with no controller at all
Just a nickel plated fo-fo, pockets got a melody, carryin' notes
Without bad breath, still carry the scope
I infrared whoever infiltrate, or disrespect, my money make it intellect, like a safety you intercept, a chain of bullets
They vics when they rubbing your chest, pincher
I treat all beef tender, no shook ones around here son
You like Michael Jay Fox when them bad boys come
Not Will Smith or Martin Lawrence, I'm talkin' 'bout boys that'll surely inspire your life insurance, life is short
Your reality is at the height of a dwarf
Say goodbye to the bitches and the champagne corks
Say hello to the ditches where your homies is tossed, in it
Porche blocks be black tinted, everything stocked
Catch me running over civilians, middle finger up when i'm removing the ceiling, dissect the whole block when i'm removing your building, this goes out to every man, woman and children
I don't discriminate, shook ones get earthquaked

[Verse 2: Punch]
Rappers are scared to death, they're scared to look
Cause ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
Niggas shook from the door like "Who is 'dem boys?"
Anything happen in front of it they're responsible for it
Niggas play hardcore like they really want a war
Find themselves ductaped in the Ford Explorer
Like "This ain't even car ford, how I end up in this?"
Walkin' on the ocean's floor at the bottom of the abyss
I'm guttin' you guppies up, take a nap with the fish
We don't wanna talk about it, we know where you live
Mattafact, we got pictures of your kids
Tryna' talk himself out of it, but he don't wanna hear
What a mess, look at what you niggas did
Dig a hole, bury yourself, by a jump off the bridge
This no subliminal, you know who we is
Tried to do the snake thing, but we got to his ribs
Not the rib that protect his organs, but rib meaning his woman that be spending his fortune
Huh, hop out the frying pan scorching, right into the fire
Hitman for hire, Punch
[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
When i be in the block, rappers, they get shook up
Cause what i'm holdin' that get your soul took up
Blukah! Sound of the chrome plated woopa
House flyin' straight to your medula, suit up
When it's time for war, lace your boots up
My advice ; get your head bulletproofed up
No mercy, when the tool bust, smooch ya'
Leave your ass asking for your future, who ya?
I don't know ya', gotta show ya', folding dough like yoga
Don't approach us, nurse bag get smoked fast like a penitentiary box
Of cigarettes, (yeah) we still got that work posted on the ave
Nickle and dime bags of narcotics, I got it
You want it? No problem, still got the fiend shook like hydraulics

[Intro]
That’s where you headed boy, to pine oil heaven. I'mma get that gun, and then I'mma get that money. I don’t believe you got it in you, Jake. I'mma go get it right now (gunshot) Oh shit, awwwww you motherfucker! The next one will kill you. Ohh, son of a bitch. You shot me in the ass

[Verse 1]
I never been a bitch in my life, I never ran from a fight
I was told when niggas bark you should bite
And these puppies ain’t eatin' enough Pedigree to scare something
They play with the word gangster til some lead dumpin
Until the ambulance coming pressin' on they chest
Calf and stomach, you grabbin' the hand of a woman
I never took the stand, snitched on my man and came back home Like it was nothin', actin' like I ain’t do somethin' wrong
Fuck it, and if I did i would look 'em in the face
Tell hop out that bucket and spray
Tell 'em to make sure they hit my head and my waist
Tell them to circle round the block twice in case
Shit, cement pump in my veins, hard body to the death
Scream fuck the world with a capital F
Everybody extinct, it’s just me and my niggas left
And this is how we think

[Hook]
No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war

[Verse 2]
And when I say hard body, homie, not in a physical
You either born with it or real niggas around real kids
And it’s passed on like a ritual, not sworn in it
You ain’t livin' it because you put it in sentences
And you ain’t givin' it if it’s ten percent, it gotta be a hundred
Walkin' down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who want it?
I got a hundred shots for any one of you blood clots
Motherfucker, we will fuck ya
Spray your coupe and leave smoke in it like Chris Tucker
I’m no gimmick, we smell out the timid
We lift something out the trunk that got a kickstand with it
You either fall now or stand with it
You either crawl now or get laid down
Think about it, I’m only giving you one minute
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, bloaw, you’re too late
Motherfucker, meet your fate

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Look between my eyes
You can see the fire burning like my Lamborghini tires
And my burner from the four fifth which is the four five
Which is that ninety-five Jordan shit
Jordans on your feet, we gon' take them shits
Put them on our feet and reshape them shits
Now don’t they look sweet?
Wear em for a minute, sell them the next week
That’s good profit, y'all ain’t thinkin' logic
You talkin' ass backwards like criss cross pockets
Mel Gibson, you just actin'
Lethal weapon, I take you niggas to target practice
Teach you niggas a lesson or two
Won’t you listen when a grown man is lecturin' you?
Cause any weapon will do in the process of fuckin' up you, nigga
You rappers ain’t built like us
Y'all just lift a lot of weights and look tough
We see through that, we shoot through anything that’s buff
And we ain’t thinkin' about handcuffs
The police runnin' from us, we so hard bodied, trust

[Hook]

[Outro]
Tongue tissue ass niggas man, ay wait, we say, either go hard or go home, tha- tha- tha- that’s what we go by, either stand for something or fall for anything nigga, bite that, o- open your mouth, bite that go ahead, you’re suicidal
Yeah, , oh fuck, I’m winning anyway, I’m winning, I’m winning any mother fuckin' way, I can’t lose



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you leave 'em what you tell 'em (Bye hater, bye hater)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kkk Dot bitch
Damn I'm fly, ain't I bitch
Don't tell me, don't smell me
Since you say that I ain't shit
I be with those Benjamins
Like he was my sidekick
We Batman and Robin
Welcome to our private affair
Where, the narrow be right here
Where, the bitches be right here
22 here, you you
Won't you change your life boo
Together we can slide through
Midnight, Murcielago, loud pipes
Make sure that that head right, damn right
I be on that other shit make them want to curse my government
Dayum, hate the game, hate on me
And I'm loving it
I'm bouncing with a couple models sipping on that bubbly
I'm talking 'bout them yellow bottles with that bucket under it
Gone in my fast car
Circle round the block twice
So they know you [?]
God damn it I'm nice (I know)
And I see a lot of haters in this room
I just look them in they face, then I say what's up to 'em

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Pull up in something brand new
Sipping on that goosey goose
I see some haters in this room
So we tell 'em I love you
Pull up in something brand new
Sipping on that goosey goose
We got some haters in this room
What we tell 'em? I love you
You, make, my life complete
I wonder where would I be
If it wasn't for you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ugh, check out the denim bitch
[?] jeans, that's some Japanese shit
That with the dictionary can't even pronounce it
Don't worry bout the name
Just know that they cost 3000
Compton, California
Home of them p-public houses
Where the beast live
And you can hear the city growlin'
Maserati prowlin'
Humping on your neighbourhood corner
Mother fucker I'm ballin'
No Motherfuck that I'm stallin' on them
Every time a nigga come through they be mad then a motherfucker
That's when I reached in my bag and I throw more cash like a motherfucker
[?] every time a nigga spending so I got it on splash like a motherfucker
3 words for them in the club every time I hear them come
Fuck them motherfuckers
Damn right, I could put that on my life
I use their negative energy for my appetite (hungry)
100 horsepower in my car
But I act a donkey
They see me when I see them then I say
What up homie?

[Hook]

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you leave 'em what you tell 'em (Bye hater, bye hater)

[Verse 1]
Live from the area code of 310
Carry the whole city on my back
Knapsack full of goodies, black hoodie, [inaudible]
Fully detach bullets from their own egos, see no evil
Who the hottest out? I'm a give 'em a heat stroke
Summertime, wearin' a peacoat
I be the baddest to ever put a lyric on top of an apparatus
Now trip, that's our flip, I'm a savage
Fabulous wordplay
And you can get served every day without a in-house maid
Be very afraid, I'm nasty with it
Born out the ass of a dragon, flamin', shitted on the masses
This harassment came from Kendrick, givin' out caskets
Puttin' these rappers in it, you fit the image of a dead man
Hennessy and chronic in the same night, so what?
Eyes red like a twelve o'clock fight

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
My nigga, what it look like?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin'
Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin' no cure
Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty-stricken, police brutality
Kickin' ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, Botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See that's forbidden, we fryin'
My nigga, what it look like?
That's exactly what Hell look like

[Chorus: Alori Joh]
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
My nigga, what it look like?

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin'
Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin', people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens
Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs, calling every human being...

[Verse 2: Zahi]
...Culinary breakin' bread
Children that were born dead
Bob Marley smoking while
Bernie Mac joking
Beautiful sculptures of Jesus, Mary and Joseph
Everybody floating, celebrating in thug's mansion
Michael Jackson dancing while J Dilla scratching
No taxes, no coke, no drugs, no pain
No hoes, no lust, no hate, no rapes
No guns, no fame, no stress, no lies
No bills, no deaths, no crimes, no kills
No debt, no cries foreal
No time in jail
No sick, no cash, no poor
No sins, no crack, no porn
Won't send your ass to war
Will you make it through the narrow door and see the good life?
Well if you do let me know what it looks like

[Ab-Soul]
My nigga, what it look like?
(I wonder what Heaven looks like)

[Hook]



[Intro]
This song is dedicated to the murderers…
May God judge you accordingly. Good luck with that one…

[Hook: Jonathan Emile]
You see the beast starts sprayin’
That's what I'm sayin’
Dem not playin’
Lord, Heaven Help Dem, Heaven Help Dem
See di man dem ‘pon di corner ‘pon cocked ready to draw
When dem face in-front of Jah
God, Heaven Help Dem, Heaven Help Dem

[Verse 1: Jonathan Emile]
Feast your eyes realize this one
That the police are just people with guns
I mean people with funds and guns given the power of blood
To lick-a-shot in a di street and get your people to run — son
And when a cop dies, we all mortified
But when a cop kills he don’t need no alibi
I’m not sayin’ that they should be flawless
I’m telling you the world is lawless
Because we got young knuckleheads power tripping with they tools
And who they serving and protecting? Brother not you…
Not true? Why you think dem call dem babylon?
Cause them just agents of the system
Twist one up get your fist up in the air
Diallo, Bell, and Villanueva I say a prayer
I wonder do they include all the police murders when they go and calculate the murder rate each year?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
They all say the average black man only live 'til 25
Pac died at 25
How many kids you know dead at 20? Five?
Now that's life, I know 10 that's crumbling in coffins
Dead as a doorknob
Fresh out of high-school and couldn’t find no job
Went straight to the grave
It’s crazy how the grim reaper in love with such tender age
I think about it as I gaze upon my ceiling
He woke up brushed his teeth then jumped in the shower
Stared at the mirror after he dried his face with a towel
And said, "This can be the day I might pass away
From an altercation my homie got into yesterday
Or mistaken identity, him thinking I was his enemy
When I never seen him a day in my life"
This is life for a young black man
With his future and his burner in his hand
While you’re on your grind, keep this in mind
We say…

[Bridge: Jonathan Emile & (Kendrick Lamar)]
Heaven help the man who takes another man’s life
Heaven help the man who makes the other man fight
Heaven help the man who fears the other man because he got a tan or he black or he white
(That’s Jonathan Emile by the way)
Heaven help the mamma who just lost her by they guns and the justice that was there for safety
(Mindpeacelove records)
And heaven knows just why they had to take his life
(Take ‘em home)
And people are angry and people want answers
He wasn’t a nuisance he wasn’t a gangster
They want justice  in these streets but there seems to be no justice for police and so
Heaven help the man who crush another man will
Heaven help the man who makes another man kill
Help the rioters who’s going crazy
In the streets all they’re really screaming out is save me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Kendrick Lamar, I want to thank you very much for doing this song
It’s Jonathan Emile, 514 stand up
Franco Proietti on the alto saxophone
Jonathan Emile on the beat
This goes out to anybody who has been a victim of abuse of power
Hate, violence. It’s time we stand up
Ferguson aye, to the world. Ahh..
Montréal, New York, ayy
Dem killin’ da people dem
Lyin’ to the people all the time. Ahh..
Inna da streets you see a rainbow
We’re marching for our rights

And I'll roll the nine, flatline, flatline, go to hell mothafucka, every shot divine
No back bone, weary spine, gotta keep ya head straight 'fore ya fall off
Me and Soul locomotives that hauled off, get up out the way or get your fame
Randy Moss, heaven in this fucking beer, swagging in these Cartiers
Especially after all these fucking years nigga yea nigga

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Mothafuck the government, mothafuck the system
Mothafuck you, I'm just living how I am living
Hiiipower, that's a nigga religion
'til Jesus come back and he tell me something different

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Solo back up in this ho, man I hope the magnum fit
Solo back up in this ho, I hope she don't tell my bitch
God damn I'm so ignorant at the same time so brilliant
Cuttin up, cesarean, but keep it on the low, librarian
Still mobbin' deep like Havoc and Prodigy
Tryna document an odyssey for every odd to see
Hell yea I know they trynna rewrite the constitution
I'm still rollin blunts drunk as fuck stuck on stupid
Hell yeah I'm 'bout that, you can't tell my nig?
Long term I got a legacy to leave my kids
How I'm 'posed to live man, the reaper keep breathing down
The back of my neck and my landlord need a check, fuck
Hell yeah, I'mma survive out here
Even if it mean flipping pies out here, yeah
Hell yeah I'm on the top of my shit
Hell yeah her tonsils topple on the top of my dick, yeah

That bitch Nicki, J. Cole, Rozay

Soul!! Hell yeah

H-H-H-Hell yeah



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
It was eye witnessing poverty
Burning bullets allowing these walls breaking
Devour these laws trying to empower me
I thought I knew the reason you grew to love sour diesel
Smoking like locomotive your focus was hourly
And then you caught me your pity party had towered me
Shower me with the will that never dried
I tell you put your worries and friendly doubts to the side
I doubt that you listen, it’s stuck in your system I tried
She’s been miserable, she’s been living in prison
Soaking up life’s reality this is the visual
Baby daddy a light build blade walking with highheel
Paid stalking that avenue, never knew how the light feel, I
Got a plan got a plan for ya
I just just might hold a couple bands for ya
And leave this message in the sand for ya
Tell me you’re ready to change
She said naw nigga it’s part of the game
Just like Heroin

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time
Please stay paced and the ground need you right on time
Say, you right on time
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God, please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
Runaway from the fire, I fly downhill
Lay your head over this side, now
You keep pain on the inside, now
Whats been eating you, who's been needing you
You been keeping it down, and
You been taking me higher and higher

[Verse 2: Punch]
Functioning addict, I’m high off her passion
Chasing history’s baddest, I mastered this apparatus
Rackin' my brain, I'm scared of being average
Going against the grain just tryna maintain my savage
Foolish of her to try to play towards my vanity
And foolish of me to let her do it, I love calamity
I love a challenge, naw I love the fantasy
And this is high stakes I risk it all for a pair of snakes
Connect the dot nigga this is fate
I'm talking predestination
I'm talking blind dedication
Plan B is contraception we didn’t make it
Sexercise a little bit of patience
The love of the rush is us
I'm addicted to violence, helicopters, and sirens
Blood pressure is skying, nigga I'm trying
I never felt more alive than I felt dying
Heroin

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker & SZA]
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time
Please stay paced and ground need you right on time
Say, you right on time
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time

[Post-Chorus 2: Isaiah Rashad & SZA]
I heard you spending all your time baby (Ohhhhhh)
And you could never get a dime baby (Never get a dime)
At least a nigga got a dime baby (At least a nigga got it)
It's hard to come home (Hard to come home)
It's hard to come home (Hard to come home baby)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock &  Kendrick Lamar]
She my gift and my curse, she really quenching my thirst
Baby my vice, she got me driving with no headlights (Is that right?)
She know my thoughts, pleasures, and pain
Everybody love her and she love everybody the same
She said I got a plan, got a plan for ya
I might hold a couple bands for ya
Leave a message in the sand for ya
Tell me you want me to change, hell naw I'm still sippin' the same
Nigga it's just like heroin

[Kendrick Lamar]
Riding around town, big taxi

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Reporting live from where reporters die
Newscasters coming too early witnessing homocides
Pearly gates forming in the sky as we wait for your suit and tie
I tailor-made it for you then told Khalifa he loves you
I'm really stuck on this bumpy ride
Highway to hell 'less I flip through a demon's TV-guide
An angel said he seen me fry
Ducking bullets
I promise I couldn't stop the work my niggas have put in
Your brains is banana pudding
I'm looking for trouble, looking for hustle
I'm a grinder, choppas in the path finder
I ain't no killa, I ain't no drug dealer
I'm a real nigga with real emotions that stand behind a
Brick wall, you knock it down then I'm forced to align ya
With the stars of Venus and Jupiter
You ain't ain't gangsta, you fooling us
The government don't know what to do with us
Internal affairs investigate while LAPD speculate
Crooked cops on my bumper dumping 'til I'm first 48
I can smell a snake a mile away because they reek hate
But any anaconda can die on a weekday
Wikipedia speeding up my career like I've been here
And I don't fuck with these fuck rappers cause they been weird
Been on my dick, get addicted to dying quick
Grab a dictionary, my styles vary, my words flip
Grab a cemetery and jump in it you jive turkey
Watching me through goggles, I throw hollows at James Worthy
Spin your head like an owl, I'm wild, I drive Fergies
That's that white thing, let my nuts & Mic hang
No one ever knows the drama that I might bring
Chilling with the drama king, but this ain't Broadway, mane
Armed forces, more fortune, alarm Porsches
Bitch gorgeous, bomb head like Civil War and
Y'all snorin', we tourin' and bottle pourin'
Model scorin', cheat the game with fair warnings
[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
Living filthy to get it, fuck writing lyrics
High status in traffic
Bad energy, getting static
Day and night like Gladys, Kid Cudi
Man on the moon, feeling managed like (Drama king) fuck a planet
Go'n with it, ashing ashes on critics
Twenty racks then we split it up, feeling like a million bucks
Bust hoes, run into sluts, keep it G, that shit a must
Creeping in that Honda Civ', ain't mine, it ain't his
Written down, spare the kids, back to the crib ya handle biz
Lunchables and sandwiches, dude dog be mad as shit
Visualize the shit I kick, never heard of witnesses
Better make sure I'm innocent, 18 shots at 3 niggas
6 a piece, hell of a life, done for the night, throw up they Nikes
? precise, for the cheese they call us mice, no rats
Everywhere is a trap, talking 'bout that white girl
Feeling good to be black, ya whole hood I seize that
Breaking down the (?), fuck all that feedback
Gone by the morning, I landed soon as you yawning
Feeling like I'm Conan, here to fuck up your whole program
Who can fuck with us, no man, Hiiipower slow dance
Kick a funky toe jam, gold rapper, that's trojan
Slinging rock erosion, and yo bitch be open
Easily I be chosen, comparing me I'm like who them
Back to back tracks, running laps
With dictionary words on top of verbs to prove that they wack
Pressing weight to the max
Hurt your man like swinging ax, release it let 'em chat
Man amongst boys but these toys aren't his racks
Itunes that shittin stacks, shitting stacks while writing raps, rap!
Looking humble, let them react
Too many bars, not tit for tat, super hits like having bats
Swinging for the fences, in the trenches making a difference
Driven like a engine, directing me through my fucking mission
[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
West coast, east side, my stomping ground, come around
Get your ass flatlined from niggas of that cracklines
Welcome to this wildlife, steady living a wild life
Trying to beat all competitors and predators, they proud knights
Nightfall; lay low. Sunrise; so live
Better watch your front-end, your back better have four eyes
So high: satellite, smoking on that bomb, nigga
Dynamite, you acting like a pussy, you no friend of mines
Better yet, fuck friends, surrounded by my real niggas
They cock back, they see caps, they peal quicker, real killers
Real business, it's never personal, Jack, remember that
Fuck up my money then I'mma fuck over your universe
I'm shooting first, never last, gotta stay sharp like shattered glass
In a fast lane with a bad dame, man, this bitch from Trinidad
Fuck her hard, then send her home, it's time to start my routine
In the streets, with the heat, you don't rhyme, you don't eat
Pockets fat like obese, it's hard to be so lowkey
Niggas acting like they know me, fuck around and be the police
Trust no nigga nor a bitch
Nigga, I'm so OG like 8 tracks and tape decks
25, but I'm straight fed
Got a old soul, I'm so throwed, so raw with this rap thing
Kay Slay, go tell 'em dawg, niggas know I'm crack, mane
Kill 'em with my flow, everytime it's a deathblow
You fuck rappers stay on your toe, we sharks in the water
Get that ass ate up, straight up, the worlds ours
Top Dawg ENT, HiiiPower
We buy flowers then we send 'em to your studio
Cause everytime we in that bitch, homie, it's a funeral
I have to slow it down so you can hear me close
Yeah, I'm nice with the bars
Late night sliding pipe in your broad
Her pussy tighter than them skinnies on the jerk dancers
Send her back with no panties
Jay motherfucking Rock[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something, or die in the morning
Section.80, HiiiPoWeR

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on the field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Bridge: Alori Joh & (Kendrick Lamar)]
Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na

Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Thug Life! Thug Life!

[Produced by J. Cole]Visions of Gandhi Baldly Staring at me
They put his face on the money to show him smiling happy
Capitalism, I can't hold on for very long
So place your visions on paper i'm getting very shabby
Godly speaker, play messiah, Holy Swiggy, Pass a beaker, Place a order... Hallelujah to the very greedy
From the Back i Boo
They Say that i'm very wrong
My five senses of fuck you are going very strong
Touch my middle finger
Curse with my breath
The sight of a sinner, hear the footsteps of death
My heated arguments, make your book shelfs to melt
And in the pursuit of taste, serve yourself instead
You see i'm Brahmin, man i never heard a pistol
But my ancestors got the Pig Fat cartridges to bite into
Buddist Laws forbid you
You kinda miss the issue
The British came convinced you for the trade
They took your tissue
Like you
Slaves!!
Slaves to Hii Power
Slaves!!
Slaves to Hii Power
Slaves to your MRS
Food for though bitches
Everybody Slaves, we fall for those riches[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges brought up
I shook my head, turned around then found a $100

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar (x2)]
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar (x2)]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
Closed my eyes then asked myself how I was feeling
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willing
I came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window
See my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this is meant for
Me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar (x2)]
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why

[Verse 4: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Lord help me
Cause I need You
I know this weed is burning
And I'm on drink number two
But it's all to soothe the pain from this
Cold, cold world
Sometimes I think You can help me
But this bus here is temporary
So I'm talking to You
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
Birds dropping out the sky, daughters having their fathers' babies
And this the news I hear
When my god kids, nieces, and nephews turn a year
I wonder, will it get better
A little cheddar, when will it get better
But the risk of that's cash will
Make last year's Christmas gift be, my last
[Hook 3: BJ the Chicago Kid (x2)]
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me

[Verse 5: BJ the Chicago Kid]
If I just keep the faith
I know You'll be right there
Sometimes it may not seem that You are there
But You're there
I feel You're there
You're everywhere
And I thank You for
Protecting me in these streets
From danger seen and unseen
I never know
What happened the night
I wasn't there
Something told me leave so I left
It was the next morning
Three got shot after the club
All listening to that small voice
Oh you saved my life[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]

[Intro]
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C

[Verse 1]
Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five, you saying that I can level more?
In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
Creation of man, and Columbine

[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

[Verse 2]
Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
They're new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout
You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me, like "My son's 'bout to win
Somehow, someday, and I don't care when"
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale, like an atheist

[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

[Verse 3]
I'll take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
That's my nigga, he a street nigga
Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me "Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you"
I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T
Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
Now what you 'bout? Nothing huh
Am I a square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah

[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

All the real smokers give me H.O.C

[Intro]
I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Chorus]
I can't handle no liquor
And these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my bitches
And my bitches they can't control me
You say you know me, my wishes
But you really just know the old me

[Verse]
Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
"When it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma

[Verse 1]
I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga
Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
I know you dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million
And a Comptown fitted

[Chorus 1]
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping — Section.80

[Verse 2]
Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch
With my back against the wall
And your bitch on the edge of my dick—jump off!
I call a bitch a bitch, a hoe a hoe, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddling
With the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
Wicked as 80 reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? there's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody

[Chorus 2]
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't a option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin' —
Hey, hey, kick her out the studio, Ali

[Verse 3]
24/7, nigga working his ass for it, she popping that ass for
The King of Diamonds with diamonds, I never do ask for it
They checking my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
She callin' the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor? You'll never hop in my lane
When you pushing a RAV4, you wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard

[Chorus 3]
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't an option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga

[Outro]
I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor
Hol' up

Hostes sert saçım üzerinden bana iltifatta bulunuyor
Eğer onu bütün bu yolcular karşısında becerebilseydim
Beni muhtemelen bir terörist sanarlardı
Kuşkonmazımı yiyin, sonra hostese genç bir zencinin düşüncelerini soruyorum
Hızlı gelen para ve özgürlük
Bir dolar için kaza kuklalığı, biliyorum onunla tanışmak için can atıyorsun
Muhtemelen bir dakika içinde öleceğim
Beni sadece 20 sürtük, 20 milyon ve üzerinde Compton yazan bir şapka ile gömün

Bir sürtüğe sürtük, bir kaltağa kaltak ve bir bayana bayan derim
Asfaltın üzerindeyken yeri kırmak dışında bir şey yapmadım
Lastik izleri sana bir şimşek hızı ile satış yaptığımın kanıtlarını verir
Bir çocuk olarak iki yetişkin öldürdüm, ben çok gelişmişim
20 li yaşlarımı 2 yaşımdayken yaşadım, akıllı adam
Gerçeği söylemek gerekirse 87 yaşında gibiyim
80 din adamı kadar kötüyüm
Alev dolu bir havuzda şeytanın elini tutuyorum
Bir mesafeden bakınca hangisinin Hristiyan olduğunu ayırt edemiyorum, kahretsin

Kimseye, kendime bile güvenemem

[Intro]
Tell to myself, still on fire
I'm under attack, but I'm still on fire
I got some chatter, but I'm still on fire
I got some threat, but I'm still on fire
I got some liabilities, but I'm still on fire
If it's not amazing that I'm on fire
I've been to hell and back, but I'm still on fire

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
What's in the back of my mind, sittin' in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, that's what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin' heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls
Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all
Trade 'em all for my dawgs, yea, I'm talkin' to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didn't deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look it's somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile
I'm talkin' real luxury, don't feel a bump in the road
We ain't like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin' it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddin'? It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didn't ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everyone in this world as long as we got each other
Woulda done anything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin' large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I ain't tell you to blow it, I ain't tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yea, I know it can stress ya
But you're only a man, homie, I ain't mad at ya

[Chorus]
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'

I swear the Lord is my shepherd, I'm 'bout to go cop a Lexus
I'm 'bout to go fuck Alexis,  take this and flood my Rolexes
This black on black is a blessin'
Black on black crime on my weapon
I protect mine on my mama and 'em, these my Usher confessions
Let it burn - Tee-Tee and Tiana sexting
Teepees and mansions I rest in
Two T's and Top Dawg impress with
TV's that play their investment
K-D-O-T go tee off and TG's and YG's gon' press it
It's our turn - I pray that I never lose you
Cause I like Benji and beaucoup bucks at my wrists
They do voodoo, curse you forever, you better not touch it
The clutching I'm used to, 250 speed racing crucial
Nigga, Vrrrrm
(Check that homie out, homie, that's K.Dot)
My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful
It's hard to say when I'm neutral, I'm tryna find out myself
Find inner peace inside heaven, find diamond piece inside hell
Will I learn

[Chorus]
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'

Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
What up though?
We the best music...
I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'ma go, aaaa
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key

[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix

[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

[Outro: Betty Wright]
Holy, Holy key, holy

[Intro: Big Sean & DJ Khaled]
Woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah (This is)
Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
What up though?
We the best music
Oh, I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'ma go, aaaa
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates (straight up)
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man (sheesh)
'Least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested (yep)
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach (beach)
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in (brr)
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
You made it up while we made it happen
I kill shit to just kill time, no chill time
In the field on time every time like it's drill time
I took a break from my girl so she still fine
Took a break from the game, but it's still mine
Got my big break, now we tryna break the records
These niggas couldn't take the pressure that I ate for breakfast
Pretty girls showin' love like I'm David Beckham
The takeover will only take a second, straight up
[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key

(Sound without Focus... is just noise)

[Pro-Verb]
With so much knock in the LBC
It was hard not to claim that DPG
Summertime popped in the L-A-C
With the music courtesy of D-A-Z
And the Soopa, Doopa, Fly for the troopers
Riders, supers, hoes, groupies
All of 'em with the short tight jeans on
"Let's Play House" all of 'em theme song
Word on the gangsta, squad up
Black, brown, throw a St. Ides up
Then the West got harder
And Soopafly hit 'em on the head on Tha Doggfather
Don't nobody party like the West though
G-Funk been the sound since Death Row
Where you think we got the kicked-in clap at?
Time to bring it back, bitch, and it's like that

[Chorus: Latoiya Williams]
Only in L.A. (Only in L.A.)
Where the gangstas play (Where the gangstas play)
Catching up on fame
Summertime in, West Coast ride

[Ras Kass]
I'm about that shit, hoe, gotta get this money
Long Beach, C-R-Son, all the shit is sunny
Put the monkey in it, like the shit is funny
Banana Clip Rassy 'bout to spit this dummy
But funkers told me to kick back
I like revenge, retaliation, and get back, nigga
Got more bars than Kit-Kat
Get smacked like Katt Stacks if you lip jack
A muh'fucker betta recognize
With a flick of my wrist like a Vulcan, you all die
All I do is ball high
Tryna stay above the rim like a tall guy
Dat Nigga Daz, Soopafly, alright
Lexus, [?], left lanes, all ride
OG to BG, I thought I warn ya
Only in California

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Moving down Rosecrans, bumping D-A-Z
Feeling like 1-9-9-3, only one to the 710
I'm in Long Beach, home of Dillinger
Dealing the gangsta shit, gangsta killa
You wankstas quit filling ya iPod up with classics
Ain't a nigga out could match them ad-libs
D-P-G-C General
Gin on my breath while Jennifer hold my genitals
Yeah it's like that cause I was taught that
Back when Dogg Food dropped in the Compton Swap Meet parking lot
Daddy V had three, sold one to my pops
We was popping out, the trunk in the Caddy was rocking out
Slap a nigga in the face with the 808s
Even made Pac salute, snares like a bear trap
They're unbearable too, bare witness
Hits like Barry Bonds, Daz the realest

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
Look, yeah
Fuck the critics
They don't know I spit it for the dub on my fitted
I wear it like a pendant
Rock's city don-dada
Who hotta?
Nada
L.A. crews, Mufasa
Shoutout to old crews, represent the same casa
West coast product 2009
They still trippin' off the cest smoke
Show me a dime
Kill a pussy with my death stroke, every time
You best know, my style canal
I got the best flow
I stay with the pound, so I'm good from the ground up
Let me take ya soul, I ain't fuckin' around
Nah, blood, cuz, or whatever
That get the shut up
Like Cheeto puffs
Keep bad boy o's that we gon' puff
Jay Rock what?
Top Dawg run the game let 'em know

[Kendrick]
Back by popular demands
Give it to you fresh out the kitchen
Pots, pans, hope my parents riches
Spit it like I had denchers
Suicidal thoughts, got me feelin' like Sean Kingston
Hip-hop with precision
We talkin' global
Perform global warming, ha
All them drops, I dropped a hundred down today
Yo' mouth drop, top missin' like a dropped toupee
I'm goin' through tracks like Jerome Bett-is
So fast you get whiplash or head-ache
Bars like Alcatraz, never been felon
But I spit it well to all the men in county jails
Dwell, on the fact that yo' plummet record sales
Make you clumsy with the gat

[Ab-Soul]
Yo, I'm so far ahead of my time
Finna lap my damn self
I'm still in the hood, like a fan belt
The fan mail comin' in bulk, hop on a bull
Every time you wanna see it reminds me of the flow
See notes like a treble clef
Step to the best and see why these niggas fall short
Like I tripped the dwarf from torn from a different cloth
Warned by a different boss
The art soon will make y'all crumble
I'm humble, but still anybody could get it
Fuck y'all, this verse is sexually transmitted
Never timid, I'm winnin' like I got dibs on it
State of mind so large, we could all live on it
Start a new community...
I remain the winner, on my grizzy
Might even hibernate this winter

[Jay Rock]
And I'm still on some boss shit
Like, I don't care how much it cost shit
Yeah, nigga, I'm a mack
So much pussy on the line, I don't know what the... snatch
Yeah, Ab-Soul light a match
Got the killa outside
Let's smoke ugh, K Dot, Compton city lyricist
Don't wack niggas, yeah I know they fearin' this[Produced by J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League]

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
I got the whole block bumpin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Na na na na now now, you know what this is
Tell 'em it's a celebration, bitches
With the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessy's, and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big 6?
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop back
To the ghetto's where I bring hip hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me "Keep it pushin'!"
The only niggas speak from way inside Central Bookings
County jails and the lock downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch
That's how they feel, Jack, built much more than rap
This that project haircut in the cul-de-sac
This is where Jose front you them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga
[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
From Compton to Baltimore I'ma kill it
I buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted
The air conditioner broke
But I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo
(Huh?) And I peel off
In the midst of gettin' my thrills off
And I thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost (huh?)
I'm puttin' the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up, [pow pow] drive-by
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
The engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real
And we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future, oh yeah, I said it
Thug life, good kid, mad city
Mad respect representin' the hub right
[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
The home girls tell me I'm the shit
I break 'em off so they can buy some outfits
I buy they sons a pack of pampers, some new Jordan's
Give 'em the game, school 'em on what's really important
It's how I was raised, the OG's had me
Thirteen, fresh off the porch, slangin' cavi
But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas
There's other ways you get them dollars and funds, nigga
Comin' down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fire ball; call it Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers, I'ma show you
I paint the picture so perfect
In my CD, you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my Crips and esse's at arm reach; one West

K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga?
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo boo

14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, "the enemies done cliqued up"
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer
Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around
Ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"

Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo boo

14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo-

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city
I was entering a new one

[Verse 1]
I get the top while I skeet off (Huh)
Swervin' through lanes, I am limitless
For the ones down, I say, "Free y'all"
I start to question what freedom is
My unc' put the Chevy on fours
I drip in all black like an emo bitch
But these are not regular clothes
These are the outfits I make a movie in (Huh)
Baby Keem count up them Frito Lays
I get the call and I go
Shawty gon' fuck all my goons, stop it
I am above the buffoons, stop it
I am above all the rules
Look at my wrist, it say "Freeze, freeze"
I need to buy a new neck, neck, neck, neck
I stopped wearin' VVs
(Huh, huh, huh)
Pleasе get the fuck out the pic' (Huh)
Hе got to fuck and he got to fuck
So what is the use of my dick?
She wanna put on my jewelry, and play with it
Like she's entitled to it
I'm done, bitch, go to your room

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give 'em ten and be done with it
I learned that shit from the gunners
Mask on, they don't know who it is
Eat the pussy so good
I give her butterflies all in her stomach, shit
I'm the youngest nigga runnin' it
[Chorus]
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hooligans, they on the way
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Had to influence the wave
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hop in the ship, go to space
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah
Drive to the crib on the lakes

[Verse 2]
I need another exit at the show
'Cause niggas be lurkin' when I hit the road, stupid
Y'all gotta deal with the boss
Y'all gotta talk to the ones in control, stupid
Even if I take a loss
I stand on the money so tall I see growth, stupid
Turn all you niggas to ghosts, stupid
Take your credit, now you're toast, stupid (Huh, huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give 'em ten and be done with it
I learned that shit from the gunners
Mask on, they don't know who it is
Eat the pussy so good
I give her butterflies all in her stomach, shit
I'm the youngest nigga runnin' it
[Chorus]
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hooligans, they on the way
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah

Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hop in the ship, go to space
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah
Drive to the crib on the lakes

[Verse 1]
Uh, now tell me who it is
K-Dot, young kid runnin' the music biz
You tell me what's worse
Me bein' the best rapper or rappers dyin' of thirst?
I'm just like a gun-clapper with these words
And you know I'm packin'
And that word is meant for Janet Jackson
I'm a black hippy, that's what I know
I wear a heart black, I love peace, that's my clothes
And so, and I don't know this name
(Steve Buscemi, he's the actor, man)
Thank you for that ad-lib, G
Next thing you know, I google him up, it might be me
I hope he's rich, I hope he's contra
Band in my pocket, no, I don't have sponsors
Don't want the police to come in this place
Because I might run and I run this race
That's in the rap game
You got some more words, I go absurd
I got nouns, I got more verbs, this is the curb
I swing, my nigs, I flip flows
I come from the West, I do it the best
I don't stress, no contest
Any rapper want to come see with Rickey Smiley?
You can't see me, we creep up back of the alley
And beat they ass and take they cash
And then we stab, off in that Jag
I'm in, uh, celebrity crushes
I give 'em, they see me, I give them blushes
I'm talkin' Halle Berry, Stacey Dash
But she vote for Mitt Romney
No, I don't want that ass
I'm talkin' Obama, I'm talkin' more drama
This another word, your momma
Nah, that's Ebony Steele, that's me, for real
She got them long hairs, but she don't wear high heels
That means she's confident, that means she's beautiful
That mean she got no dirt in the cuticles
That means she got that watch
I mean, she got the shades
Shirley Caesar, left seat, man
After forty years, they'll sweep her in through the city
That's like me, that's like Jay Z, Pac and Biggie
That like me, that's like rappers don't know where I'm from
That's Compton, everybody don't want none
I got the people in the back straight cheerin'
I got the eyes wide open just like the deers in front of the



[Verse 1]
K-Dot, Kendrick Lamar, got mad heart
Come from Compton, I spit straight heart
Got my hood on for Trayvon Martin
Freedom, justice, you know we gon' be started
Get the party started every time we come through flippin'
Flamin' Hot Cheetos I'm eatin'
I'm skippin' across L.A., that's somethin' that we do
Each and every day, hangin' with my crew
Throw another word, watch how I observe the train
Matter of face, where's my girl, Sherane
And when I say "train", that don't means that I flip her
Yeah, we did toss, turn just like Flipper
My favorite cartoon, you know
Got to go with Bugs Bunny Cartoon Show
Tiny Toon Adventures, Dennis the Menace
I'm a menace, I spit, break the World of Guinness
When I'm flowin', you never know, I need another word
Give me nouns and verbs, what I spit is absurd
The Finals, the Heat, yeah, they came with the Heat
LeBron, Wade, no, they can't be defeat
I stay in the shade, I'm in the darkness, I'm hot though
Another word, homie, you give me what you got
Who kills my vibe? The haters, the groupies
The Hoovers in the streets, they try to shoot me
I move with heat, you never can stop me
I come from Compton, (?)
The best strip club, it's down Atlanta, it's down Miami
I stay with the (?), I say, "What's up, shawty?"
You got your girl, I don't like fake ass, I need a referral
I see everybody twerkin'
Even Miley Cyrus got that motherfucker workin'
You can never stop me, The Rickey Smiley Show
I'm here, I'm here, I'm lettin' people know
The better celebrity female in the game
I like Rihanna, who else could complain?
I love, I can't even say the word
But I'm cussin' and I don't need to pronounce a verb
The Black Hippy is the crew, we do what we do
We stay in the booth, we do it, we shoot
We straight for the stars, you know just who we ares
We ride in Buicks, then we pushin' the flashy cars
I'm a flow all day, this The Rickey Smiley Show
Just to let you know, we still 'bout to go
They bring me in, they show love with the crew
Rickey Smiley Show, huh, you know what it do, what's up?

On the response to the line "I’m the king of New York":

It made me go back here and feel like I probably gotta dumb down my lyrics nowadays, for people to take it way out of context the way they did… The main heads that really understood the context of the line was the actual kings of New York, the cats that I sat down with this past week. They’re not understanding that it’s not about the culture, it’s not about what side we on, it’s about being great as Biggie, as Pac, the two cats that I referenced… I feel like I’m a student. I’m a student of the work that they did. When I put down 20 years in the game, I can eventually plant my foot and have that same type of legacy… I never take the history behind what Pac laid or what BIG laid.

On Kendrick’s king of rap, Snoop Dogg:

To keep it 100 with you, Snoop will always be number one, and I’m from the West Coast, and he gave me that. But out of respect for my big homie, I understand it. He laid down. I only got one album out homie. One album out. I got years to be doing this. At the end of the day, Snoop will always be my big homie and the legends that came before me they will always stand tall where they’re at. But I can’t stop myself from wanting to be great just like them.

On East/West rivalry in 2013:

I feel as though you have certain cats that are really gonna take it to the next level and make it a rivalry thing and try to bring back that whole thing. No that’s old school homie. We black men out here trying to uplift the culture. My first sold out show was in New York…I respect the legends in the game. I respect people that done it before me, people that lost their lives over this. Because of what they laid down, I’m gonna try to go ten times harder and breathe it and live it. That’s the point of the whole verse, what I was trying to convey through that verse. All the ignorance behind it, you can kill that noise. It’ll never be like that again, two coast rivalry. Not on my behalf.

[Intro]
Yeah
You're now rockin' with the best
Hub City's threat
Minor of the year
K. Dot
Ooh, it's about to get so ugly in here
It's about to get so ugly
Like whoever's listening to this
Oh man I crack myself up
Yeah
Oh my God man, oh my God
We 'bout to shit on these faggots man
Check it
Yeah, K. Dot
*Let me get that*

[Verse]
First niggas used to rapping, get my attention
Now I don't even listen
It run through one ear and out the other
And I don't buy niggas records for music
I'm more interested in their album covers
I'm a talented brotha
Plus I move so quick it's like my brain came with a joystick
Motherfuckers better listen when I spit
I knock records out the park
Homeboy I Ken Griffey a hitch, and I might Ken Griffey ya bitch
But won't buy her shit, not even a small bag of chips
Just give her long pipe 'til it's scrapin' her hips
Like a waitress, the way the broad ask for the tip
If you want, just ask for a clip
I'll give ya those for free
I won't charge a fee
Just roll up on you, like cut off sleeves
Nobody can cut off the-
-number one rap artist
Damn, I am the hardest
Blowin' through Nintendo cartridges
To Maybachin it, valet parkin' it
Now people arguin'
Who is better? Them or him
Him referring to me
Them referring to the industry
Hands down, Jay left, now give me the crown
Fuck later, I'm takin' it now
Fuck haters, I'm takin' 'em down
With the red beam, red beam, silencer, don't holler it muffle the sound
Bark like ten rottweilers straight from the pound
Straight for the dollas, 745 [?] Impala, scrapin' the ground
I suggest you follow, or not be smarter
Seein' another broke tomorrow
You can tell the way I speak begins to stutter
First it was hard for y'all to even makin' it harder
Ain't about money, then please don't bother
Y'all niggas funny, talkin' bout that you run shit
When I'm lookin' at ya like "Who are ya?"
Y'all niggas is gas
And what make that bad is y'all niggas is trash
Y'all don't wanna see me spaz
Out, pull the gats out
And see me blast, ouch
You better off coppin' a pen and a pad
Than copyin' the last rhymes I had
And spit 'em to your homeboys 'till they all say "You wrote that?"
Tell 'em lies or, give 'em the facts
It don't matter 'cause in a minute, imma be chargin' my raps
A G for a bar, that's 3 16's, plus a 8 bar hook nigga, add up that
I charge you a verse like Dre would charge you a track
Your whole budget, hoes love it
But you hate it, 'cause I'm your girls favorite
Nigga, face it, you can't walk in my shoes nor change the sides tryna replace it
As far as rap, I spit in the Matrix
Past reality, nigga actually, I wrote a rhyme where there was no gravity
That's a whole 'nother planet
For real holmes, I do damage
Blow up ya city, even ya school campus
Run in ya class while your doin' ya standards
Let it blast
One gun subtractin' ya life, now that's the basics of math

[Outro]
Oh my God man let me stop spazzin' out on these niggas, b
They have to call 911, I'm done
Dave, you feel me man? It's real
K. Dot man, just havin' a lil fun up here man
It's real ugly, ya know?
Yeah, bang, bang, let's go



[Intro]
Right
Gather 'round hustlas that's if ya still livin'
And get on down with this THC vision

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
The last of a dying breed too many whack artists
So tell em Parappa the Rapper nigga rap harder
Like being garbage some type of disease
I take em out their misery, make it harder to breathe
Ain't no problem to me, call me Father MC
Pay homage to a God, bitch fall on your knees
Hood booga wannabe house wife gassed off nini
High sadity meanie tryna emulate the TV
But this real, fuck how you feel
Call of Duty mode with these verses, lot of kills
First niggas doubted the flow, now how you feel?
If this was back in the days you'd get a lot of gills
Gimme mines, I really rhyme
Yup really I'm, one of the illest niggas doin' it
Or these niggas is losin' it, silly minds
They try to style on a New York nigga
Like my flow ain't cold like a New York winter
I don't stunt, I regulate
Seen empires separate
Best friends kill best friends everyday
For petty sake not even heavyweight, it's never good
There's a Rich Porter story in every hood, DZA

[Hook: Mara Hruby]
No matter how far we go
We forever be real, we'll never fold
Know my niggas stay down, we all we know
We gotta get it so we live it just remember what we do and won't stop

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
My turbulence put a burden on young herbs
Once it's crackin' it's a chain reaction minus Yung Berg
I'm on the verge of excellence kill em off with no evidence
Take a shot at the Excorcist then X em out with these words
Panoramic views be tumblin' out my mind
This ain't 1992 bullets tumblin' out no nines
Big AK's like Alicia Keys abbreviated
And nowadays niggas stand behind em like Clive Davis
Clyde Drexler, before the hood got dribbled niggas right up on the stretcher
An understatement said that K. Lamar was under pressure
Don't press ya luck when I'm pressed for time
Cuz when the press get this verse, their sure to press rewind
The president's prayer can't save us in my cul-de-sac
There's codeine, crack and cognac enough violence to keep the devil smilin' while we whilin' on them corners with them ropes and rats
Nigga build a trap house, hope his homies don't run his trap
See the Feds and tap out that's wrestler shit
Don't rest your case as a gangsta because you wrestled your bitch
We move in silence, like the potato tip when we ridin'
And we ride rotten, 2 choppers found dirty sirens
You ain't been where I been, I know where I'm goin'
And life's a bitch, I know that she hoing
I know what I'm sewing, what I reap
I know that I'm flowing like water from sea or water from creek
And if I don't speak, I know you ain't growin
Cuz I'm a leader, respect it when you see em
Accepted by yo new bitch, yo old bitch and yo BM
Y'all always on that BS and PS I'm takin all fades
I'm takin off first, this G6 is on it's way

[Hook]

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Uh, you know what it is
I'ma make sure everywhere you go you see me, baby
You hear my voice?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I never had a problem with your old nigga
It's just how we mob, we don't know a nigga
She put me in her past and she moved on
But I keep her sexy ass in my new songs
We all make mistakes, we gone fight
There to wipe a nigga tears in the late night
She wanna cum before me, tell her, "Wait a minute!"
Now we on the water, elevators in it
Dancing to another artist, I'm the one who pin it
Ghost, with the most, see no competition
Working in the club and guess who gotta tip out
Long money, I'ma show you just what Rick 'bout
Rims on the coupe, baby, haters wanna sue
Me and you against the world, what you wanna do?
What you wanna do? What you wanna do?

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Frustration (watching you dance)
Hesitation (to get in them pants)
Come closer baby (so I can touch)
One question: Am I moving too fast?
[Bridge: Miguel]
Cause' I ain't leaving alone- feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know

[Hook: Miguel]
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time

[Verse 3: Miguel]
Temptation (is calling your name)
Sweet persuasion, oh (baby this is a game)
Come closer baby (if you like what you hear)
Impassioned (is what I'm making you feel)

[Bridge]
[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch cause your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
State your name, live in the moment
It’s your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never get a first let away

[Verse 5: Kendrick lamar]
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them big trucks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die - in it
Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it

[Vamp: Miguel]
Or waste your time, or waste your time
Or waste our time, baby it's alright
Baby it's alright, baby it's alright yeah
Oh it's alright now
Alright. Oh yeah
I don't wanna waste my time, no
I don't wanna waste no time, oh no
I don't wanna waste your time, babe
I don't wanna waste our time, Oh my time, Oh whoaaa, now

[Hook: Miguel]
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? (oh yeah)
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time (come wit' me baby)
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three (yeah it's just a short drive home from here)
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time
[Vamp 2: Miguel]
No-no-no. I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight

[Outro: Miguel]
Let's go, shit we only live once right?
I mean, where's the fun in forever anyway?[Verse 1: Miguel]
Frustration (watching you dance)
Hesitation (to get in them pants)
Come closer baby (so I can touch)
One question: Am I moving too fast?

[Outro: Miguel]
Let's go, shit we only live once right?
I mean, where's the fun in forever anyway?[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
"20 on pump 6," dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
"20 on 6," he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need"
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God"
[Outro: Ronald Isley]
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs

[Verse]
Uh
Who's sick as me?
Tell the truth, bitch, nobody, and that's real
And as far as my eyes can see
I'm the only one fucking with me
Myself, so put your album right back on the shelf
And let real business get dealt
You ladies man like Leon Phelps
I pee on any man tryna discontinue my health
I don't give a damn on how you feel or how you felt
Your small mercy won't help
When shots circle around your waist like designer belts
I design your face, the [?] lift ya up
Rock niggas like Bobby Boucher, you waterboy
What you want, weed, dope, or water, boy?
It's right here, and y'all catch up, I move fast like light years
Now it's back to the basics
K. Dot's nothing to play with
A nigga tried to test my gangsta
I pulled out a weapon and aced it
My grade point average at the top of the brackets
I'm sick like a cancer patient
Assist many players like personal agent
Y'all as foul, clothes to fragrance
I'm the best now
Plus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows
Sit down, practice your verbs and nouns
'Cause I'm on the verge to progressin' my words
I'm the best you heard today, hands down
So hand down whatever you had
Like you been in a bag
Put it in garbage or trash, I'm the best you had
Ever since, oh yeah, intelligence
K. Dot, so heaven sent

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I kick a funky friendly conversation that keep they mind racin'
You can't complain about the flow I got
I let my thoughts space out with the astronauts
Like the white boys say, "Pass the pot"

Let me smoke for a minute...

As god as my witness, I never abuse this hip hop
I'll never pretend to be something I'm not
Giving you something to rock to other than hardcore rap, possible
You ever been under hypnosis I mean literally
Not being focused with your eyes open
They say 90% of humans don't even notice
Now can you imagine a couple of minutes passing without you knowing what happened
Without you knowing people was laughing at you
They say the worse scenario is when they have to catch you
You wake up out of your mind, your whole thoughts is baffled
You're doing things like trying to touch your shadow
Now here's some realistic, is it something that can happen or is it just a gimmick
You never know until your bear witness
Bear witness...
Bear witness...

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You woke up in the morning, took a shower
Call some bitches over, want them to be over in one hour
She came over, you fucked
She left and you hopped in the truck, you
Took your shirt off cause outside was burning up, you
Skirted off turned your beat up but your gun was tucked
Under the seat, you headed to long beach
Hop on the 710 the carpool lane
Only cause you got black tint and they can't see a thing
Your check engine light popped up, its feeling like bad luck or what not
You tried to maneuver all the way to the call box
But one lane before you got there your car stopped

Stop

If your was listening for the past two minutes
Then you just made accurate 90% hypnosis

[Verse]
Welcome to the wild side, Hub city's wild side
Where tecs fly that's homicide, my stacks like a mile high
Fly as a bitch, got a condo on cloud 9
Slap box with God, jump off heaven and skydive
So supernatural K.dot come and see me on Sci-Fi
From 5-6 with five nines two mac-10s and Glock nines
Lets do this however whenever tell em I'm ready
Waters run deep way before Katrina broke the levee
Look partner, I'm no gangster, I'm no killer
But please believe I know plenty gangsters that'll kill ya
I don't like you, I don't feel ya you're very unfamiliar
So please build your catalog before I knock your cattle off
This saddle off on a red horse that's a red Porsche
That's not your favorite rapper in the booth
That's a dead corpse once K.dot kick chaos
Niggas bitch off like canines click up and click, click, click boom
Smell the fumes on my Levis
Bitches poppin' pills and mushrooms in my hotel rooms
I squeeze dick through their thick thighs then bounce like this beat from T.Dot
Six T.Vs in my new SUV F-U-C-K-Y-O-U pay me
Or pay me no attention and meet the criminal henchmen
Genesis ain't shit, I know local henchmen
Come shoot me I'm in a two seater with hootie, motherfucker

[Intro]
Nobody pray for me
Even a day for me
Well

[Verse 1]
I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finessin' 'em all with some counterfeits
But now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives
In fact I'm downin' this
D'usse with my boo bae
Tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good
Won't you sit it on my taste bloods
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block
Then break it down we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M. funk
Piss out your per diem, now you gotta hate 'em funk
If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes funk
If I quit this season I still be the greatest funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put a baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
There's levels to it, you and I know, bitch, be humble

Who that motha' fucka' think he frontin' on man?
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the sandman
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fuckin' up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of that Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on a Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretchmarks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
This shit way too crazy
You do not amaze me
I blew cool from AC
Obama just paged me
I don't fabricate it
Most of y'all be fakin'
I stay modest 'bout it
She elaborate it
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk

If I kill a motha' fucka' won't be alcohol
I'm the realest one after all
Bitch be humble

I just wanna hop into a lobby when I wake up
Steal a Whip, and kill a couple niggas get my cake up
But these niggas make me mad, I'm feelin' like a Game Grump
Pull up on your block, and shoot you down like it's Hatred

I remember making bedroom hits, and now we're counting this
Then I took the "Selfie," this ain't healthy, kids ain't down with this
Wanna meet the plan I took for granted 'til the xanax hits
I can't even read it, 'cause I'm the one to kill the analysts
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Don't let me down, we're back in town for the greatest, funk
We're just playing around and I still miss my momma, funk
Chris Martin in my apartment, how the fuck we do this, funk
The "Sick Boy" just went viral
Platinum going on the top, [?]

Woo!
Shoutout my hustlers, I mean
Everybody hustlers
You feel me
Look, look

[Verse 1: Cozz]
I said, wake up, open up shop, get your hustle on
Selling pills straight out her crib, and break into another home
Tryna get in and out, get his double-double on
This ain't my story that I'm singing nigga, but this is another song
This probably your uncle song
Probably your big brother song
Your father or your mother song
I understand your circumstance so in your head there's nothing wrong
How you could blame how we behave?
If we paid and we ain't getting loans
You don't know what's going on
If you ain't live to see this shit I can't describe
Taking chances so they survive
This all happens just to take a life
In the end it was all for bread
And use the heat just to make it rise
Not sure how to raise a daughter
But they know to raise the price, so what you goin' through
Tell a nigga what you going through
I could probably relate
I could probably be late
And still be on time for you
I could probably spit mind for ya
If you don't wanna tell your story
It's the same as yours, I hustle early in the morning
[Chorus: Cozz]
I said, wake up, open up shop, get your hustle on
Selling pills straight out her crib, and break into another home
I understand your circumstance, so in their heads, there's nothing wrong
But they don't know what's going on
They don't know what's going on

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
If I can't lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely

[Verse 2: Cozz]
Yeah you got your car, yeah you got your gold
Your money don't fold but your mama still at home
Fam don't want your dirty money
You look clean, but your mother sad
Your girl felt neglected, now your daughter got another dad
Local block hustler, my father was a customer
Mom's used to watch him buy his weed then she would cuss at him
Only for the weed, he felt free from that subtle bust
Moved back and it was primetime
And now I'm on my prime time
But hustler turned pimp, doe
He was getting pimp dough
Now only selling his dope
But now he selling nympho's
Not so cautious about how he sells
Made his way to county jails
Now he lonely in them cells
How he feel
It was probably hell
He got out, but on that same shit
I guess when you loyal to yourself then you can't switch
But how can you blame kid
Don't know what he was goin' through
Cause hustle is his bread and butter
He don't want no other food
[Chorus: Cozz]
But I wake up, open up shop, get my hustle on
Wake up early in the morn'
Make a couple records, getting reckless on these records
Til' these fuck niggas respect it
Go and get it, make a difference
Wake up with a new perspective, motherfucker

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
If I can't lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Justify the love of mine
For life of crime, my life and times
Is hard at times
I fall a time, like all the time
And then I dream for baller time
And then the clock rewind, and I
Wake up
I know homie
I know homie

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
If I can't lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely
[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Justify the love of mine
For life of crime, my life and times
Is hard at times
I fall a time, like all the time
And then I dream for baller time
And then the clock rewind, and I
Wake up
I know homie
I know homie

[Outro: Cozz & Kendrick Lamar]
We ain't chose this type of living, it's what we gotta do
Part of niggas hear us cripping and drop out of school
Selling drugs or they pimping like some prostitutes
Living in a nightmare, Pinching is what you gotta do
Wake up

[Outro Skit: Cozz]
Hello?
Rise and shine, nigga
Bro, what you need, bro
What you on nigga? You tryna hit up the mall?
Hit up the mall?  Nigga, I got like five dollars. I don't got no job
And I know you broker than me bro so what you mean
Yeah, that's why I said "hit up" the mall nigga what you talking about
Get your ass up man, let's roll

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Freestyle up in here
I'm at Paid Dues doin' my thing
K-Dot, Kendrick Lamar, man
I'm from the Bay, ya-da-da
And I've got money and I'm sayin', 'Ya-da-da'
Got the long hair, curly hair
I got the TI$A on, that's the clothes that I wear
You got the Ray-Ban glasses
So many girls in the crowd and they got fat asses
Thirty-pounders, eighty-pounder
Where she at, man? I'm a down her
I'm a drown her, I'm a down her, a shower

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Need a strap all day, it'd smell like that sour
Uh, uh, uh, Sour Power
Uh, uh, HiiiPower
(Uh, uh, HiiiPower, uh, uh, HiiiPower)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I ain't no joke I used to let the mic smoke
Now I'm like Mike Jordan with the flow
Identify with a scientific scope
Scope over the rifle
Fragments and potholes
Got rappers selling surveillance behind black tint in the parking lot at Roscoes
Making the change lift straight jack move
Pack 2 some mechanic
Pull it out you panic, flow nuts like cashews
Shift to Cancun, even though I’m Compton
Like Raider Caps and Corduroy house shoes
I be the illest witness the lyrical drug dealin’
When I distribute the word these rappers get hard feelings
No remorse sucka MC’s throw fits cause I carry the torch without Olympics
Kill all friendships my enemies
Go against the God MC? penalty crucifixion
So nice wish you had 3 ear drums to listen
Damn right I be the don Corleone of rap songs whether on the east cost or back home
We clap chrome like magnetic monkey wrenches
Used to hop fences
Now we hop on top of bad bitches pass em to the homies like basketball assists
West Coast Vengeance, East Coast Revenue something new like
Pac in Versace lenses Big in the Khaki Suit
Best of both worlds when I step in the booth
Suicidal thugs from them him her and you
I kick away the chair you hang from the noose
Shoutout to sidegun and Papoose, Kunta Kinte and ?
Bringing it back to the roots, you understand
[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Yeah yeah yeah from Cali to N.Y
You already know lets get it in
(I ain’t no joke)
Like Mike Tyson in his prime, knocking out rappers with every line
Won't attest how I come back with a forty-five
Like MJ, sucker MC’s expire
LA Nigga not to be fucked with, Thug Quick
Guns tucked nigga we buck shit
We do pop take off your rooftop
On the rooftop with choppas infrared dot ya
One shot no doctors, just yellow tape and white sheets
Buck chrome tell em why
Living like felipe though you lay on our paper
Yo life we repo play for keeps, no need for peace talk
Catch contact whenever the weed spark
Yeah its chronic in whatever we smoke
Got signed but I’m still in the hood like a brick of blow
Hit the club made my pick n’ roll this should give em dough
Jay Rock used to be in them drug spots
Now I rap for the dough all for the Mula, hoo-ha
Sucker MC’s no threat, i could run laps around each one no sweat
They’d all be scared of me, no one ahead of me
Nailed to the throne, I’m a project celebrity
These niggas ain’t all that they said they’d be
Nothing but images raping the youth stealing their benjamins
Under the dirt is where we sending them
New coupe speed off color be cinnamon
Nike Cortez’s, and Pendletons
LA style hop out slide doors on a minivan
Its like that spray the whole block if we miss one spot, what we gotta do
[Kendrick]
Come right back
I play the passenger
Dumb shot then pour gas on ya
Acting like Nelson as I laugh at ya

[Jay Rock]
The young boy Casper ya
Ya soul rise out the casket bruh
New rap game lazarus, Top Dawg ENT Soliders ain’t nothing after us

[Intro]
Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(One two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

[Chorus]
And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time

[Verse 1]
They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile-

[Chorus]
And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated—
All ya'll come to the front, ya'll come up to the front
(I love myself)
Baby what about you, come on

[Verse 2]
(Crazy, what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

[Chorus]
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)

[Bridge]
Huh (Walk my bare feet) Huh (Walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down, down valley deep) Huh (Down, down valley deep)
(I love myself) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
(I love myself) Huh (My heart undone) one, two, three

[Verse 3]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right (Oh no)
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body...

[Spoken Interlude]
(Offstage Argument)
Not on my, not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids bro

The judge make time so it ain’t shit
It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog

Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen, listen to this:

[Verse 4]
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying: "Fuck niggas"
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive

[Intro]
We're livin' in a gold bar (Runnin' to the right law)
Duckin' in the trap (Duckin' in the trap)
Livin' in a group (Livin' in a group)
Watchin' TV (Watchin' TV)
Dedicated to the homies in the pen, hit me

[Verse 1]
(Hey, hey, hey)
Uh, this is a word premiere, this is a world premiere
(Hey, hey)
Uh, I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil want to put me in a bow-tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah, yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfucker want to down me
But an amigo never drowned me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

[Hook]
And I love myself
Ho, when you're lookin' at me, uh, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
I love myself
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, it ain't that high
I love myself
Uh, one day at a time sun gon' shine
[Verse 2]
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep movin'? (Keep movin'?)
Or let the paranoia haunt you (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confident
Everybody lack confident
How many time my potential was anonymous?
How many time the city makin' me promises?
So I promise this, huh

[Hook]
I love myself
When you're lookin' at me, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
I love myself
Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy, don't seem shy
I love myself
One day at a time sun gon' shine

[Verse 3]
Want to say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
(These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation)
Aw, man, I duck these cold faces, post a fee-fi-fo-fum basis
Uh, dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
Strong in me, I still smile
[Hook]
I love myself
Uh, when you're lookin' at me, uh, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
I love myself
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't be shy
I love myself
One day at a time sun gon' shine
Everybody, hit me

[Bridge]
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (Down, down valley deep)
Fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum)
My heart undone (My heart undone)

[Interlude]
Aw, man, ay, check this out
It's a real Compton thing goin' on right now
You feel what I'm talkin' 'bout? You dig that?
Sometime I just feel a little bit b-beside myself
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
This here's the return of Enoch
And we gon' do it to y'all like this
Here we go, one, two, three, hit me
[Hook]
I love myself
The world is a ghetto with big guns and Dickies signs
I love myself
But it can do what it want whenever it want and I don't mind
I love myself
He said I got to get up, life is more than suicide
I love myself
One day at a time, the sun gon' shine

[Verse 4]
I went to war last night with an automatic weapon
Don't nobody call a medic
I'm a do it 'til I get it right, war last night
I've been dealin' with depression
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could, I could never take the lead, never bob and weave
Negative is lettin' them annihilate me
Evident I'm movin' at a meteor speed
Finna run into a buildin' there
Money in the ceilin', lay my body in the street
Pass me to the buildin' of the holy unseen
Pass me to the feelin' of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a everybody scream, "I love myself"

[Bridge]
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh, woes be me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry

[Interlude]
YG, chicken wings, I love myself
I love myself, I love myself
Aw, man, ay, ay, homie
I told you it's straight up a Compton thing
You dig what I'm talkin' about?
And this here's dedicated to the homies
Y'all feel what I'm sayin'?
Sometimes I just get besides myself
The return of the Enoch is back
You hear what I'm talkin' 'bout?

[Verse 5]
Uh, I've been lookin' for you my whole life
Appetite for the feelin' I can barely describe
Where you reside?
In a woman, is it in money or mankind?
Something's got me losin' my mind
Where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the dirtiest pistol
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
I could be your advocate
I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is
I could preach for you with the mighty tongue
I'm the one, how can I overcome
Negative energy, more like infinity, and survive?[Intro]
Try it if it feels right (try it)
Try it if it feels right, yeah
When you try, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Jorja Smith]
I'm tryin'—I'm just, yeah, I'm just, yeah
I been out here tryin' to see my homecomin'
And of course, somebody's always gonna say somethin'
Try and shoot me down for voicin' my own opinion
Triggerin' a part of me that's always been indifferent

[Pre-Chorus: Jorja Smith]
And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
[Verse 2: Jorja Smith]
Open up this letter you ain't tryin' to read
You've been blind to the subject, but not blind to me
And I know that this margin ain't too small for me
Not too real, not too much anymore, not enough

[Pre-Chorus: Jorja Smith]
And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free

[Outro: Jorja Smith & Kendrick Lamar]
If who I am offends you, don't feel sorry
Don't feel, don't feel sorry, don't feel, don't feel sorry
My loss is worth more than your wins
I'm satisfied if it starts over again
That is everything, that is everything
That is everything, that is everything
That is everything—
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I, stop, I am what you not
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I, stop, I am what you not
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop[Kendrick Lamar]
See y'all don't understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
You can shoot shots or cheer cause I... am[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Full time grinder
Watts City/Wise city rhymer
The ghetto Moses tryna get my homies outta bondage
Need some time to think so I'm rolling up the ganja
Sneaking out my pores, know I'm blowing on the bombest
Bars looking nice, my rap smoke polish
A God on the mic, wack rappers pay homage
Leader of the new school
Everytime I bust a rhyme, incredible lines
When I talk, make em' press rewind
I do it for Hip-Hop, fuck what you heard
Do it for my nigga's who voices will never be heard
Listen, blessed with talent, voice of the young people
Went from a zero, now my city label me as a hero
Nine, double-O, five, nine, that's where the chopper sing
Sound so melodic, the problems, that's what the drama brings
Dog I'm gutted as ever strivin' for finer things
One-O-Five Eastbound, swervin' in and out of lanes
This game filled with a lot of lames
On the real my nigga, this shit gotta change
From Cali to Queens, Top Dawg guarantee
We the new regime

[Hook: Ludacris]
I don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
And I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Like, 4 years ago
I was writing rhymes in my Chevy Celebrity
Spittin' the hardness, says Doc Elery
It's prophecy I shine, ask cashanova
Burnin' up my notepad tryna ash my doja
Sober...
For the game you decayed I sow it up
You must say yes too much
Cause you don't know enough
To match my caliber, I'm a whole new breed
Ya stamina's shot, I'm movin' like the old .23
For Hiphop I breath...
Have a seat, I'm a beast
And I'm ready for war with no peace
Seems that they forgot to rap, you had to think
They just wanna be ballers when you see em' on the screen
Who am I to say the grass ain't green
Who am I to say the next generation don't share the same vision as we
I will say this, it's less likely
Than me having clean piss
Rest in peace

Omar Jones
Your spirits in my lyrics when I flow
Became the number one prospect
All because I keep it true, I don't do it for the coupe
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]

Draped in stone like I gazed at Medusa
Download my audio and blow up your computers
Spit that conglomerate shit, the shit that you aren't used to
Shit so strong the unborn can smell it in the future
They'll sell it and they’ll shoot ya
A Mom and Pop store sold out
And the fan killed the clerk over my music
Is that real?
Realer than me at 16, writing sixteens, battled and dismantled six teens
All for the love of hip-hop, I would still rap
Even if Rodman came back and my diss flopped
Thats an analogy built with substance
Fuck an award, my metaphors for the public
You forging your signature on [?] the great great K.Dot
I gotta catapult you, bye bye
I wake up in the morning then compose a bar
Flow reckless like the first time you driven a car
Perfected, from years of dedication
Wrote my first 50 songs and then I graduated
With my bachelor's
And if you hearing this verse, I probably got my masters
And by the end of this verse I'm your favorite rapper
[Hook]

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]

Coming from where the diplomas don't matter
Backpacks still carry the work
Big burner under the shirt
Shit I just wanted her purse
Kill a bitch and hit the studio to murder a verse
I'm just getting it in
Reminiscing about the time when I was stressing to rhyme
Started getting better, shit I'm destined to shine
Clip load up
Fuck it back to the crime
Profession of pro skaters couldn't fuck with my grind
Still stuck with a nine
Shooting like MJ in his prime
You motherfuckers know what it is
Straight splatter your wig
Let your mother know its personal
And murder your kids
Little nieces buried in anchovies
Rap Lebron, Kobe
Hip-hop, shit, no matter what I'm talking
Cough on the beat and its abortion
Murder motherfuckers, straight extortion
Live on the beat
Who wanna compete?
Down in Miami spitting heat, straight tragic
Move to Orlando working magic
Cocaine balls out the cabinet
Uncut, raw, whole ransom
Anybody can get it, I'm fully committed to Hip-Hop

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured that I hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
501s, Louis letterman jacket
Little brother only 5, momma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
That every section 8 tenant is familiar with
Ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s
But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
You got 80 sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers
That was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A million bucks, and that's why

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it (Ho)
Uh, So give me fifty feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You-you niggas check this cash and I'm GT crashing
105 off-ramp, hey
And little nigga got it going on, G5
Going, going, going, gone
Cloud 9 mind state
I drop a record then I raise the crime rate
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck skip to Y

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it
First off I'm a rider, bitch
Put them 26's on a Silverado, bitch
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Snap my fingers, she'll go find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product 'round town, Frank Lucas
Confuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up
Ok, Subway bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me. Paper over pussy, nigga
When I drop you ain't getting paper nor pussy, nigga

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition of cool is
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Verse 1: Y-O]
Now I prefer women with some sexy toes
With no corns but enjoys eating vegetables
Seem like everybody love the role of assholes
But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes
Mr. Michael of Amish yo speaking
Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln
I hear they fell in love with my penis
Only concerned with my balls like Venus

[Verse 2: Thurz]
Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot
Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top
Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot
U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop
On that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me
I’m still serving, broads on my TIP for gratuities
[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Oh Lord, here he come, there they go again
Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch I'm going in
Burn a swisher up, then I roll again
Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure that dough keep rolling in, hah!
Got the world going crazy
Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me
Nigga's swag wavy, chauffeur got me car-pooling
So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it

[Verse 4: Brown]
Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me
She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie
Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing
We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci
Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me
T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras
Hoes are choosing, niggas' hating, we ain’t tripping, keep our balance
[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
These hoes want to love me, man
So I'm like, what up? Uh what up?
Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting
That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
Chucking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won
Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously
I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
I'm 'bout to make that halo burn, now goddamn that's some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside a Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief
Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Intro]
It's K. Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Who say West Coast niggas don't know anything about real hip-hop?
I'm 'bout to give you a prime example

[Verse 1]
Where my gangstas at? Where my dimes at?
Where my nickels and dimes at?
.45's Mac 10's and nines at?
9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat
If its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer
You wanna die? I can help you
Put the rap beef aside and [?] the content of the street shit to the block, parental advised
I'm feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime
Mike Jordan in his heyday
Call me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines
I'm tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred
Uncle Bobby's still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas
Grandpa moved to Mississippi
I really can't tell if dude missed me
Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe
More reason why my heart cold
Prior to a lot of hatin' going, Feds raided the studio
We tryna do songs, but they ain't listen
They just kick down the door as if they have permission
Why you had to do that for?
I wish Pro Tools was on record
Wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something
No assumptions, I know I'm nice
I know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass
Not Atheist, but the bars reside with Satan
Chokin' the mic, releasing my frustration
Rather do that before I catch court cases
Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic
Boxed in like a new Porsche rollin'
Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen
K. Dot's in my colon
That nigga, Colon Powell
Modern day war victim
Oh, I'm foul, come join my coalition
No snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant
Feel relentless, new apprentice
King of, comprehension
No competition
Compton's back, pump your fist like this and that
No sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts
You're a disgrace to this rap business
Just a one-man office, you need assistance
Gun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors
I am a senseless thug, with book smarts
And anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question
We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession
Gave you the rhyme scheme before your English education
Exclamation, put it in quotes
I say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag
The flow, the artist development
Am I who gave you the growth?
You didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed
The sun shine, and now king me
The rapper's rapper, the MC's MC
Kodak moment that's been captured, cheese
I said cheese



[Verse 1: Ammo, Tha Warchild]
They knew he was West Coast when he walked thru the door
In all gangbang attire bodies parked on the floor
Rag in his back pocket, nigga, dare him to trip
Faded and associated with the Bloods and Crips
Ask questions if you want to, two to ya dome
I stay making donations to the funeral home
I gotta aim like a marksman, bet he leave crawlin'
Afghanistan spitters on anything walkin'
Nigga known to keep the burner with some extra shots
I let my mothafuckin' tech play connect the dots
Same whores and gang wars, time to settle the score
Hit 'em all with the black talons, leave 'em dead on the floor
You fucking with psycho, like no other
With a nine in my pocket and the mind of a hustler
Certified riders, Comp-town's finest
You should rewind this, warhoggz behind this

[Hook: Ammo, Tha Warchild]
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)
They say we ignant (What it do!?)
They say we ignant (What it is!?)
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)
They say we ignant (What it do!?)
They say we ignant (What it is!?)
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)
They say we ignant (What it do!?)

[Verse 2: Vincent Maggiano]
I don't wanna pop pistols, have something hot hit you
Plus I'm running from the feds, got kids in block issues
What you gon' do when yo' homies is not with you?
Cut out yo' eyes, mail 'em to yo' mom's in box tissue
You are not official, I don't do it 'less it's beneficial
Vinnie gonna have to let the semi whistle
Have that ass on the ten o'clock news
Don't get killed for tryna pay dues
Stay sinning, always be winning while they lose
Roll Benzs, fucking these women off Grey Goose
Close your curtains, disconnect your mind
You're soul searching, you talk shit but you won't hurt him
Let the fo' burn him, so the next time you speak up on me
You gon' feel it up in your sternum
I will never leave, that's just how it is so let it be
Before I have to hit you with the Desert Eag'
I rip the melody, and flip a set of keys
I guess it's meant to be to have me sailing on the seven seas

[Hook: Ammo, Tha Warchild]
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)
They say we ignant (What it do!?)
They say we ignant (What it is!?)
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)
They say we ignant (What it do!?)
They say we ignant (What it is!?)
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)
They say we ignant (What it do!?)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride like it's four wheel drive (Ride)
Ride till we forklift the tires (Ride)
Ride and we never get tired, ride on our enemies
Crime chemistry got me hemorrhaging blood out my memory
I'm Ted Bundy if the money exist (Ah, nah)
Al Bundy 'cause my other hand is gripping my dick, ain't nothing funny, bitch
Monopolize my prophecy, they watching me thru binoculars
Obviously, bitch, I'm Pac in these Wallabees
Wanna-be's wanna be me, take one of these then take it easy
The Lord wants you and Forbes list need me
Lord forgive me for my ways, I blame it on how I was raised
Inside of a cage, praying with slaves
Compton, California, the coroner work for seven days
Throughout the week, you might as well leap yourself to a grave
Lunges out a bottomless pit, bottles of Hennessy
Guzzle another fifth, pop a pill then pop in the clip
Pop a shot then circle the block, then you just repeat it again
Ammo, reincarnated, Rambo, now tell a friend, motherfucker

[Hook: Ammo, Tha Warchild]
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)
They say we ignant (What it do!?)
They say we ignant (What it is!?)
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)

They say we ignant (What it is!?)
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Lord forgive me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kill him where he stand and stand over him
Shake his hand then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam
I ain't backing down for nothing
I'ma back 'em down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
Police radio signals saying that a 187 land on your corner
Coroners comfort your momma
"Momma, he's dead," the next morning
I toasted up with my homies, we drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from
Uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know, I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumping
On enemies; I'm head huntin', no sympathy, ain't no love
When you in these streets, just get something
Protect your neck 'cause they coming
For sets, respect, split your onion
Then chop your deck
Your head tumbling like gymnastics (Ooh...)
'Cause ignorance is bliss

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
Then peel off in a hooptie
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably, I'm too street—indubitably, I'ma do me
Better than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
But just give me two weeks and I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
Cats so watered-down clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently, you're a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves... that ignorance is bliss

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters 'cause you busters are Casper when I go off
I show up, to show out and show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you are, then wreck your car
And walk up to my crime scene
I remember bein' 17, wishin' someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back
Is when they rewind me
Backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her
Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
'Cause ignorance is bliss

[Outro: Kendirck Lamar]
And Willie B, I'm a fool on your beats
I bleed out the speaker
As the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak



Kendrick Lamar: Cause ignorance is bliss
Sigidy: It's nearly sad as toddler as he wonders home
He shooting baskets he wondering if his father's home
But realizing his father's shot in the collar bone, they snapped it like a toddler bone and now he's in a foster home
His anger turns to loneliness until he's mad again
Scout looking through the scraps for a weapon to shoot it back at them
Visions of sadness he pointing it and imagining bullets travel like javelins and stabbed em in the abdomen
He went from this passive child to a massive style black a wild child on the block smoking black and milds
Living in sadness is madness if you can crack a smile
A once proud and happy child is just sadden now
The kid grows up chillin' playing madden now
Bout to have a child of his own and this niggas rappin' now
Rappin and packing the strap instead of em backin' down, clappin' down clowns round town for the cabbage now
Smack the ass on the spouse hittin the black and mild

[Hook]
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
And opened my eyes
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
But my love was blind

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You was caring, you was sharing, you was thoughtful, you was sweet
You was upliftin', you was different, you was commited, you was me
You was supportive, you was honest, easy going
You had promise, that you'd never break a promise
You was life, you was free, from the bull shit
... I think

[Hook]
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
And opened my eyes
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
But my love was blind

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You was insecure, jealous hearted, slight retarded
I was nauseous, I was marching back and forth, and you was forcin' me to forfeit
Female fraudulent, you female doggin' it
It's like extortion on my heart and shit
I probably fell for it, cause you was gorgeous
Now your course, done ran it's courses, and of course you know I'm exhausted
Time you know I surely lost it
Should of been wiser, should of been cautious
Should of been tighter with my game
I chose a dame that chose to entertain drama and what remains
Is hate, so fuck your fucking name
You fake and live in a hall of shame
Materialistic, egotistic, thirsty bitches
Open house, and mouth for niggas to stick they dick in
Thought you was different, but you wasn't
Take that back, I wish I would of just fucked with your cousin
Ass was fat, but never mind that
We out here fussin', fightin'
Ask your friends to give advice, but they just like you
Clashing like some titans, could have broadcasted on pay-per-view
Promise that you never break a promise, should I trust you?
Now you only go for condoms, on late nights just because you, with the bull shit
[Hook]
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
And opened my eyes
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
But my love was blind

[Intro]
September 22nd, 2009
Kendrick Lamar
To... to...

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you
Scared of you but I will fight you
I stare at the ceiling and think about you
Curiosity killing me, thinking of when I'ma meet you
You introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers, children and babies drive me crazy I wonder
Why you love people that love people that do right?
Is it rocket science to you or is it just your type?
One of my biggest fears, is waking up 4 in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
Or maybe a person that I'll never meet 'cause of you
You, son of a bitch and I wish you never existed
And I swear I'd blow your brains out if you pay me a visit
But that's not realistic, 'cause you'll never rot
But I'ma still send this letter off
P.O. Box, and when you get it....

[Hook]
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Let me continue this letter saying I don't like you
Scared of you but I will fight you
Should be ashamed of the moves you make
The pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break
Everyday you remind me that you're always there
'Cause every time I come around someone's getting shot down
And all I say is a prayer, "so help me, Lord!"
Then the Lord talk back, "I can't help you, boy!"
That's fucked up, my life's fucked, was cursed before birth
And what's fucked up, I gotta live my life with the hurt
Of knowing that you're everlasting
Dwelling upon the masses
Of the Earth fatal assassins
Snatchin' bodies
Probably, on my notepad as I write
Why the fuck you wanna take my life?
Sooner or later, I'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
So when I write on this paper
It's real talk
So...

[Hook]
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar as Death]
Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you too
And the reason we haven't met because I've been busy doing whatever since grade school
I've watched your every move
You slipped up a few times, I gave you a pass
So don't say I ain't sympathetic
But you can barely get curiosity, I'ma dead it
Everybody wanna know why I act this way
Let's just say... I had a bad day
Matter fact, everyday
But I take it out on somebody and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
I was born to be a killjoy, I'm an old brat
Conceived by Adam and Eve, so who you mad at?
Not me, see me? I'm just doing my job
And you ducking me? Is mos def an odd
So why send this letter as if I never knew you?
I rather knock on your door and just hand it to you

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
It's everywhere
The streets, the corners, the coroners, the morgues, the cemeteries, hospitals
Heard about it when I was little
Tomorrow's not promised, 'cause any day can be knocking at your front door
War, genocide, homicide, suicide all coincide
Signed and sealed by the living
Make it, don't take it

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Come on… She wanna roll…
Catch me in the cut with a cup of the juice
I’m chilling, believe this, I’m Jesus to women
They all want to jump in my coupe like a pigeon
Smokey on Friday, find me on the highway
Middle finger up, not giving a fuck
Like a nun who masturbates, congratulate
The [?] in my bathub
See, my style is a cast of
Goldie Mack, super fly, Bumpy Johnson
Holding my Johnson when you jump on my dick
Because haters always like to jump in the mix
Say they can dress but always throwing a fit
They must know I got cream when I’m pushing the whip
That’s whip cream, use your common sense when listening
I strike gold when I roll like a pirate
Soulo won’t you call T-Mobile and play the sidekick
I’m number one…

[Chorus]
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz…
And you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz..
[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
My game on point like fingers in the courtroom
But I ain’t snitching, I’m just winning
I’m just twisting high with the flyest women
Lay ‘em down in my project building
They catch feelings like root canals
I boot ‘em out when they talk about lovey-dovey
Shut up and fuck me, low key with my broads
Make sure they never cross paths
Cuz if they ever do it’d be all bad
I play the role like Samuel L
Tell the hoes what they really wanna hear like
You my boo, you my baby, you my number one
Drop it off in the drop then tell another one

[Chorus]
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz…
And you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz..

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me, I ain’t trying to see the grave
I’m just trying to get fresh to death
I’m in the club with a mean two-step, like the sisters to Cinderella
The clock strikes midnight
I’m still in the spotlight like a lab rat, bad back spazzing out
Sip henny until I pass out, or mash out like a sack of potatoes
Looking for a good girl gone bad from Barbados
To bring to the pad
Not for the mouse, but to the house, calling a cab and I’m kicking ‘em out
Nah, I don’t run it like Chris Brown do
But I can make a tune you can sip Krystal to
My game on point cuz my aim is sharp, even when it’s dark
Travis Bark, famous star, rider
But don’t blame the car, I’m an eye’s desire
You would go blind sizing up my attire
And you ain’t gotta say your boy is that hot cuz I know I’m that hot
Like arguing with a narc with rocks in my socks
I walked in the door, she said “Who are you?”
I said SOOOUUUL[Introduction: Woody Harrelson]
Ladies and gentlemen! My man, Kendrick Lamar!

[Kendrick & Background Vocalists]
Livin' in America
Thuggin' in the trap
Livin' in a groove
Watchin' TV

[Kendrick]
Dedicated to the homies in the pen', hit me!

[Intro]
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yay yay
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

[Chorus]
(And I love myself)
Uh, when you lookin' at me, uh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy think they high
(I love myself)
Uh, one day at a time, sun gon' shine
[Verse 1]
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, huh

[Chorus]
(I love myself)
Uh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine

[Verse 2]
When they say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line full of fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
(These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation)
Ah man
(I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis)
Uh, dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
[Chorus]
(I love myself)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, uh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine, everybody, hit me!

[Bridge]
(Walk my bare feet, walk my bare feet)
(Down, down valley deep, down, down valley deep)
(Fi-fie-fo-fum, fi-fie-fo-fum)
(My heart undone, my heart undone)

[Interlude]
Oh man, hey check this out, this a real Compton thing goin' on right now, ya feel what I'm talkin' bout? Ya dig that? Sometimes I just get a little bit beside myself, you know what I'm talkin' bout? This here's the return of Enoch, and we gonna do it to you like this, here we go: one, two, three, hit me!

[Original Chorus]
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
[Verse 3]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
War last night
I've been dealing with depression, duckin' every other blessin'
I could never see the message, I could--
I could never take the lead, never bob and weave
Negative letting them annihilate me
Evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my--
Money in the ceiling lay my body in the street
Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make everybody scream, "I love myself!"

[Original Outro]
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry

[Interlude]
Ah man, ay, ay homie, I told you it's a straight up Compton thing, ya dig what I'm talkin' bout? And this here is dedicated to the homies. Y'all feel what I'm saying? And sometimes I just get beside myself. The return of the Enoch is back, you hear what I'm talkin' bout?

[Verse 4]
Uh, I've been lookin' for you my whole life, appetite
For this feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
In a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Something's got me losing my mind
Where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was 17 with the .38 Special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
I could be your advocate
I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is
I could preach for you with the mighty tongue
I'm the one, how can I, overcome
Negative energy while I give infinitely and survive?!

[Produced by Skhye Hutch]

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Back when I first grabbed that pen
I told myself I was gon' win
And I ain't know when
But it was gon' end up happenin', I want in
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive, and put me after Em
I'm a fuckin' genius
Grippin' my fuckin' penis, livin' this life
You can't tell me nothin'
Still ain't really got no money, fuckin' right
I'm all about that real, about that real
This ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearin' Polo drawers
Put two chains on, and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild, too damn proud
Been killin' this since Cam made "Oh Boy"
Oh boy, I'm the man now
TDE, put the money in my hand, ain't shit free
This business is quick sand and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Blat, blat, blat! Rest in peace
You just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say
When I wanna say it, okay then
Furthermore, we do this for y'all
Rap is stressin', but it pays great
That is, until you lose appeal
And your release date get date raped
Stay safe, hold your head
I got two fish and a loaf of bread
Feed the people food for thought
‘Cause we all equal, who'd have thought?

[Hook: Ab-Soul + Kendrick Lamar]
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I used to wanna rap like Jay Z
Now I feel I could run laps 'round Jay Z
Nas ain't seen nothin' this nasty
BIG and Pac got it comin' when I pass, too
You got the mic? I ain't the one you wanna pass to
My niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed
HiiiPower on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too
The brand new niggas with a attitude
Poppin' in Compton or Timbuktu
I might even sell my new shit for ten bucks too
Too ill when I jot these words, true eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch
When you know life's a bitch, then that's not your girl
Cold shit, I'm hot though, like coal get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm
I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes, on P's, y'all know me
Flow like water, admiralty, the best author ever to breathe
And as we proceed to follow these dreams, I ain't losin' no sleep
No-no on them NoDoz, just know "no" if it's no dough
So high, but I'm Soulo, two cups and I sip slow
Takin' my time, we don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show
Now let's go!

[Hook: Ab-Soul + Kendrick Lamar]
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Time and time, I drop line for line but only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine and cop thirty 9s and cock back and kill
See, the truth is they wanna know
How close me, Dre, and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this
To beat 2Pac, but truth, I give two shits
'Bout expectations or critics hatin'
Shit, I just put Moms on vacation
Bitch, you never know my new location, it's across nations
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the mothafuckin' king dethrone now
I am ruler, I am highness, the Prince Zamunda
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tint like Kinte Kunta
Black is back, bitch, I'm kin to Kunta
Black-on-black crime resent the shooter
Blat, blat, blat! I intend to mute ya
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks
Without my A-game, so please don't ask me about no pressure
Bitch, with the grip of my fingertip I can hold this coast together

[Hook: Ab-Soul + Kendrick Lamar]
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
These streets is Jurassic, cowards get asthematic
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere
That's the ghetto bird. Pull up on the curve
"Wassup homie!", smoke a nigga then dip
It's the immaculate, verbal assassin
Strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This the Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry low low, with four zones of weed
No sticks, no seeds
Prestigious when I pulsate the 50 states
My need for speak can corral the largest crowds
Mosh pit, with a big dick screamin' "Bitches ain't shit!"
She gobble gobble for hours, I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour hardest Emcees, softer than clam chowder
No challengers can compete, their childish and weak, detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein

[Hook]
I'm Corrupted
I'm Corrupted

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Gimme a hundred g's, for every emcee I dropped to their knees
Verbally useless
"Oh you got the juice!?" I squeeze you juiceless
Catch you, hang you, from any nooses
Been the truth since "Snoop and Tha Pound" was fuckin over Ruthless
Young and I'm ruthless
21 with 21 guns, shot and saluted for Pac
Lyrical cyclops, lasering in on paper and fraudulent friends
Bitch you's a bitch in disguise, and bitches get ten
Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal Injection
In the regal higher than church steeples
I swear to God, can ya lyrics in a jar
I'm a pterodactyl tearin ya squad like pardon
Me and Terrace Martin enacting Martin
Cannibal coexisting with the coldest, that mean I'm the sickest
And Thera-flu won't do, whenever I'm kicking the wickedness
Explosive, cinematic, smoking
Like the barrel of this TEC aimin at ya neck
[Hook]
I'm Corrupted
I'm Corrupted

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm from C-O-M-P-T-O any nigga can get it
The lil homie strapped and he with it
At the Avalon's swap meet, "wassup fool!?"
Blunt longer than Rosecrans
I grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry
Practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches
You are counterfeit, worthless piece of verses surf this
West Coast with a big scope kill all yal
It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT
Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A-S-A-P
Complete havoc composer, disorder: rhyme addict
Slaughter houses full of Joeys, Joells, and Royces for ya
Live from the area code of 310
Laughing all the way to the bank with 3 elmos
Three 64's, 1 bottle of goose
I'm the truth
You can put ya hand on the bible and shoot

[Hook]
I'm Corrupted[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
The- the- the reason that I'm breathin'
Seeping heat, it gets me cheese, why I'm eaten in Bad Season
Was deep in beef and was needing some beats to release in evenings
Instead of me being up and bleeding with thieves and heathens with keys and obstacles
Made it possible for the flow go to be profitable
Yo Tech's audible, his inaugural prada popped and was plausible
God is so good for giving me music!
Liftin', gettin' me through when I was fixing to lose it
Dudes hit Big Scoob's shit and reppin' the blue tip
Fool's skipped when Scoob scritch, we jumped in the 2 whip
Full clips for who stick the homie for true grit
My crew, thanks to music, we all living through it
Got me out of the ghetto, got me mucho dinero
In Cozumel, Mexico shorts and Jordans and a sombrero
This gift ain't given from a devil, so settle
Come and get this rebel music that's hot as a kettle, pendejo
Saved my life, paid my lights, made my wife, say "Bye Bye"
Gave my night babes, I like preyed my mic
Would never fade, forever slayed, days I write
My cheddar raised up better, faze way high hyped
My music's one reason I always get to lay my pipe
The reason Tech N9na can comfortably say "Night, night"
Blessed me with original flow, so hey! Why bite?
I hear, I feel, I live, listen and learn
I like...
[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
(I love music)
Yeah, I love (I love music)
For real (I love music)
And I need (I love music)
To feel (I love music)
Go and play it (I love music)
Yeah, know what I'm saying? (I love music)
My love (I love music)
Know what I'm saying?

[Verse 2: Oobergeek]
Automatic when I do this manually
Daily, monthly, annually
I get a step closer to being the coolest
Acoustic got me foolin' and about to lose it, ooh, sh-
Jump in the grind, and my hom' Mean Mike produced it
That's music pahtna
I'm just a poet with incredible rhythm
Words arranged will let you know he has incredible in him
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but toot toot, ha ha
I laugh because it's easier than do ray mi fa sol la
Ti do, we know he go say what on that C Note
And he can pay a C Note with that B Note
I'm talkin' truth
And I got stories that I show you that it's walkin proof
A thousand miles of it and I can show you what I'm walkin' through
Music ain't a hobby, it's an organ of my body that the creator provided back in January of '92
So don't you dare say good music skipped my generation
Your hatin' ain't nothin' but motivation for these compilations
Oob!
[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
(I love music)
Yeah, it feeds me (I love music)
I need (I love music)
To feel (I love music)
You know what I'm sayin' (I love music)
It's my thing (I love music)
Go and sing (I love music)
And I love (I love music)
Yeah, go ahead

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Music is my life
The reason why I write
Like Edgar Allan Poe on the beat, like a parasite
You thought a parachute made my flow just fall out the sky
Then you fell apart into a body part no one would buy
Nobody tried my limits 'cause they're afraid of heights
The ambition, weak or gravity, let 'em die
I let you live until a nigga compose a rhyme
Then it's like a rhino in your ass every time
Time and time again I treat my pen like The Pen
Bars harder than Pelican Bay and I been
Servin' a life sentence since the day I was ten
Nine times outta ten you only ten songs deep before you leap
Into a pool of sharks then swim
That's an analogy on the way I do casualties
And I do this shit casually, before the verse end
I'll be in the Hall of Fame with my picture framed, friend
[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
And if it wasn't for my music I wouldn't be standing here!
If it wasn't for my music you wouldn't have nothing to hear, yeah
And I love...

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
(I love music)
I need it to live (I love music)
[?] (I love music)
Yeah, and I love it (I love music)
I'mma be quiet (I love music)
Ssh
And I love it (I love music)
Show enough love (I love music)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Wake up!!!

[Verse 1: Eshon Burgundy]
When I first wanted to rap
I can't front man I fronted the facts
Fabricated every single statement that I ever made
At a young age said I'm running wit gats
No body shots man I'm coming for hats I'm at 'cha melon
Cool guy in real life but I'm a felon
On tracks
Then I set my pants on fire
Liar liar singing to the choir let me fall back
Then I fell on my knees and said oh Lord please a young fella need help
Told me He was all I need to love everybody else including myself

[Hook: Eshon Burgundy]
I love myself
And it's okay you feel a type of way
Ain't nothin' corny bout dat
I love myself
I'm a Christian rapper I ain't no actor man I'm really bout dat
My lifestyle realer than it's ever been
Even though you might be thinking it's irrelevant
It's realer
Fo' realer
On my mama I ain't never been a killa

[Verse 2: Eshon Burgundy]
In 06' I wanted them to trust us
So I said I was the hope pheind hustler
And then I dropped "A note for the hopeless"
That was 09' when I got focused
Just being honest if they looking they can find us 'cause we out here hiding in the open
Been grindin' but it ain't mere talent
It's an honor I could ever be a spokesman coaching
Players in the game of life
Might look like a dealer but we ain't alike
And I ain't better
I ain't said I was a angel at all
But I ain't finna stand here like
I don't love myself

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eshon Burgundy]
I'm just trying to figure things out
Has there ever been anybody to ever take the same route
Qualified by the streets I was raised
8yrs young when I caught my first fade
5yrs young when I think I got saved
Got my testimony on the block in PA
Plenty things God used to bring about change
I could load 'em up and let 'em go like a gun range
I remember they was blowing kush in my face
Told me I was broke go ahead and smoke
Might as well wallow in ya sorrow
Unless you hit the lotto go and hit the bottle
Nope
Couldn't make me sell crack either
And I was trying to get chicken like the next man
Heard a false preacher say I need a bankroll so I was praying for the green like a jets fan
When I think back
Bout where where I ain't yet
I could've went and got it all like a blank check
Could be mad that I ain't got a hundred J's
All up on the stage wit a hundred chains
But I am a good father to my kids
Made a honest woman out of their mother
And I love her like cake on the plate of a fat kid
I'm real I ain't gone walk up on you like a undercover
Came as I was to the throne of Heaven and made a shameless plug
In the name of Christ Lord take my life
I know ya pain is love
Martin Luther King went to jail over 14 times and he ain't a thug
So where you think I'm going huh?where the prophecy going or to hang at the club

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I've lost my head
I must misread what the good book said
It woes me be, it's a jungle inside
I give myself again until the well runs dry, I

[Outro: Eshon Burgundy]
I love myself (x6)
On my mama I ain't never been a killa



[Verse 1: K. Dot]
I sit on the studio couch
Ask myself, "what the fuck am I thinking about?"
Thinking 'bout living without the past and the present
A Dr. Dre record, imagine, I drift off, 600 seconds
10 minutes exact, letting my mind explore
K. Dot had turned Curious George
You know, off the hardship is what I'm curious for
Like what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads?
Before he turned right to get them shots through the door?
They say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic
So he'd risk his own life to get someone else killed
But in the process, get injured, it don't make sense
It's like the Da Vinci Code, trying to solve the crime of these rap souls
What if B.I.G. never did it big?
Never went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bullet-holes?
Would it make my flow more persistent?
Would it raise up the bar of competition? Who knows
Who told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with HOV?
Would the battle be less interesting if it wasn't personal?
If Jay wasn't intimate, there'd probably be less people listening
People thinking it's a publicity stunt
What if he partnered with Jay and still didn't blow?
Hip-hop would really be fucked
Something like Milli Vanilli
Nothing different, quite similar
Filling up my mind capacity
Thinking about Martin Luther, on the balcony
What if the shooter-
Better yet, what if Malcolm on the side?
Killed two birds with one stone, both would've died
Now let's rewind

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Imagine if Tookie was a Blood? Look, no disrespect
But would there be more Bloods than Crips sets?
Dominating the population of
L.A., Orange County, the Valley, and back up to the bay?
Matter fact, imagine if we didn't really start this gangster shit
Y'all wouldn't have nothin' to spit
No drive-bys, no flags stickin' out pockets
No N.W.A. dudes, just rappin' like Cre Cru
Imagine if Mike Concepcion walked on his own two
Feet no paralyzed, would he be alive?
Or would he been lost his life to the streets?
No match, no cars in that driveway
What if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin?
On this L.A. strip, would these rap niggas use his name?
Nah, what if rap niggas never had rap?
Would they try to fall back on this drug game?
These rappers ass backwards
Now these rappers getting caught with the cocaine
But to smoke, not to slang
Imagine that people not knowing these rap niggas insane
Just think about it

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life

[Verse 3: Punch]
Imagine life without death, would you even feel alive?
Your people that passed, what if they never died?
Imagine seeing your mom cry, tears of happiness
Knowing her son safe, and she ain't lose him to this madness
The street living, what if the crack epidemic
Never reached the projects and destroyed our buildings?
Turned most of us to killers, innocent victims
Imagine if heroin didn't affect our system
They say drug money funding the labels today
What about the drug money that's funding the C.I.A.?
Imagine if they really tried to fix these streets
Would they start in the hood, or executive suites?
Where the real criminals meet, and principals beef with me
You could possibly live without heat
Imagine if Al Gore had won that election
Would the Twin Tower buildings still stand erected?
Imagine the penal system without witness protection
Would there be these many cowards on the stand telling?
I don't know, I'm just speaking my mind
Lost in my own soul, Just press rewind and imagine
(Training day, training day)

[Verse]
See, I'm the man, tell 'em roger that
I got bitches shattering glasses trying to holla back
My pockets fat, if not they getting there
That's VIP, nigga, you'll never get in there
See, I inspire conversation with dollar signs
You either talking money or just remain the mime
She got a fat ass with an amazing mind
That mean great brain
I swear to God every time I pop off that I pop a vein
Now ain't that true love?
I tell her kill Cupid and give my crew love
And you ain't getting it 'til you get in that jew love
I'm talking Seinfeld, Ben Stiller, Wall Street, bank tellers
Tell 'em you couldn't bury with two cups
Papa need his courage or face eternal extortion
I harbor around the orbit on my Darth Vader
You'll see the light saber dropping jewels, Marc Jacobs
You knowHow long will it take for this pain, for it to go?
I been all on this road all alone
Ever since I was down, they ain't call my phone
Now I’m on, they wanna give me a ring
Now I'm on, they wanna be on my team

[Verse 1: P Yungin]
I lost my cousin, yeah, it fucked me up, saw him in the casket
Same day, walked up in your funeral, was itchin' to blast it
Niggas be speakin’ on them bodies, but them bodies we havin'
I had no sheets on the mattress, leave yellow tape like a taxi
Mm-mm, I'll blow you down, nigga
Hundred rounds on that Draco, we gon' bring it out of town with us
You speak up on my name, I leave your family with a frown, nigga
"Who that in that black?" PY masked down, nigga

[Chorus: P Yungin]
Oh, oh woah
How long will it take for this pain, for it to go?
I been all on this road all alonе
Ever since I was down, they ain't call my phonе
Now I'm on, they wanna give me a ring
Now I'm on, they wanna be on my team

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & ]
I don't wanna use that Glock, PY, where that TEC at?
Drop that foreign to the shop, they lift the shocks
Shit where the set at, if they don’t know what I say
Where you caught, You gone get left at
Clean my gun in front the fire place
Members right where the ash at
And got ’em coming at me sideways
I say foul play, I say shoot the bitch
Got that money comin' nine ways, ain’t still on groupie shit
We drop one, hang with murderers through the date, soon as my shooters spin
Out the window, hit him, we aiming at his face, know I ain't new to this
I'm Xans, I'm gon’ shoot the shit ()
Kill his mans, don't care who he with
I say is that wrong what they do to me
LSU we scoping cars, don't forget to pick[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
They leave the city behind us
Straight out of Compton
You need a compass to find us
Waters that blue when people called me "your highness"
Prince of Zamunda, you get in tune with the lions
Away from the rumors and those who assume what I am
Parked onto Hollywood to Hawaiian
Bitches I’m in the reach of 90 degree climate
It’s me, beautiful sounds at CCYN’s
Cheer CLK slash G Wagon driving
I’m a L-A-M-B-O hoppin' out, cool on auto pilot
Smooth ass babies' bottoms with Johnson baby powder
Hey coward, suck a big dick with aids on the tip
No homo, y'all just make me sick
I’m ready for war
I got my riffle, my sword
Blueprint mapped out, this is what’s it all about
But for now cop a sweet out in Singapore
Piña colada with umbrella straws I’m telling y’all
This is Big K nigga
Big clip in broad day nigga
Big K, wave it your way nigga

[Chorus: Tools]
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
'Bout to touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hoppi' on boats
Gon' throw it up
Then nigga let’s toast
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
'Bout to touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hoppin' on boats
Even when I’m gone, know my heart’s still close
[Verse 2: Nu Jerzey Devil]
Out the hood
Now I'm walkin' through that white sand
With some Latin women who any watching them belly dance
I got a belly ache, I’m eating too fast
I can’t slow down, they force feeding me the cash
I got a big appetite so I chow down
Pocket full of hundreds, fuck it I’m a boss now
I make boss moves
Bitch I’m overseas
Fucking on four bitches, blowing foreign trees
Amsterdam, maybe Oslo, Norway
I’d do me, I give a damn what a whore say
True P pinstripes like Jorge
Yankees fitted on blinds through the doorway
Ha, yeah I’m back on that gully shit
Number one hustler to get money wit'
N. Jersey Devil, yeah you heard me
But you giving out the trust, I gained it early
Exit out this fake shit, no thrills
Get back to reality, travelling through the hills
Bitch I’m out of here
Deuces, peace
Pendejo, carajo, adiós, capeesh

[Chorus: Tools]
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
'Bout to touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hoppi' on boats
Gon' throw it up
Then nigga let’s toast
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
'Bout to touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hoppin' on boats
Even when I’m gone, know my heart’s still close

[Verse 1: VeEg]

Ya Veegy the realest
They hate on me coz i'm living
I'm talking JD all night
My homies know what the deal is
My brother's tying the knot
I told him cherish those moments
Every morning, you roll over
And you see what heaven brought you
My flow is so sick like Ne-Yo
So Heat like Chino
Banked up like Tito
I'm tryina hit these key notes
I find myself turning up
Now not only on weekend
I've got contacts on my phone
I really wonder who she is
Man I've got nothing to hide
I said on top of a hill
I met some skeletons on the way
Need that secrecy bill
Coz man the stakes are high
I got me a knife I'm  eating steak tonight
I'm living but i need a break tonight
Too much of life could be like Kryptonite

[Chorus: VeEg]
What's good?
I'm Living
How're you doing?
I'm Living
Are you okay?
I'm Living
You sure you're straight?
I'm Living
Now turn it up?
I'm Living
E C
I'm Living
P E
I'm Living
Where you at?        X2

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lemar]
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in
To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached, I’m on some other shit
Like fuck the government, I’m higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation’s insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life’s a bitch when you ain’t focused nigga

Chorus

[Bridge: VeEg]
Man I just came here to have a good time
I can't myself, myself
And if you've got a problem with that
Then you can move to the left, to the left      X2

[Outro: VeEg]
I don't know Yay, sometimes we can be so ignorant

[Verse 1]
This is for my mothafucking Compton babies
And all the wild blocks that drove us crazy
Dominguez Hospital born
Niggas dying fast no life insurance
Black ski mask green leaf body bag liquor poured
So much 40 oz poured it's like the curb's made of gold on the ave
Bullets got no names on it so if a girl get hit the response of it was like our bad

[Verse 2]
That's the mind of state, rap niggas meet your fate
Say hello to the hip hop's Norman Bates
I ain't even burn 'em yet
Dave Chapelle these niggas are half baked
Well done when the second first come
I have an acquired taste
I will not let not one MC go to waste
I will eat all day
I will not, cannot lose, comfortable at the top
I'm sittin' down my legs  are crossed like i had (?) shoes

[Verse 3]
I tell dude, i ain't worried about these rap dudes
They're not in my league, the West coast is me
I'm, sub-zero, I put your career on freeze
I put it on Hov like I had (Calvin Jeans)?
I'm nightmare on Elm Street, come right through your dreams and
Delete you like an unwanted movie scene
Say hello to the team, ain't ya?
You're scared ain't ya?
The world is anxious for my LP
Get pop grades, i get an A-plus, you get a D
Fucking failure!

[Intro: Mark Morrison]
Return of the mack, return of the mack
Return of the mack, you know that I’ll be back
Return of the mack, return of the mack
Return of the mack, you know that I’ll be back

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T]
Today is the day I get out on my feet
Remove them chains, they shackled on me
Press my luck, stop fucking with them hoes that cluck
Cause the same motherfuckers the ones that got me stuck
Tryna use me up ’til my tank on E
Then leave me stranded, scrambling in these streets
For a dollar a day until my pockets is straight
Soon as you move out the hood them niggas hollering you fake
Make ‘em swallow the bass from the Kicker
I’d rather be a dead man than a nigga
I’d rather roll chrome rims than a swisha
I gotta make moves, I can’t hang with ya
That used to be the fly shit back in ’95
But now I want a crib and a car I can drive
And ain’t nobody out there help me cause I’m grown
Gotta leave them childish games alone
Nigga I’m on

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I’m in the hood still praying for a piece of faith
I know he on his way I’m hoping he don’t make it late
I’m up the bat, I just hope I make it to the plate
I’m Babe Truth, you can tell ‘em I’m one of the greats
Used to shoot for the stars now my aim live
I’m the truth nigga something that your name not
A thousand watts ain't a thing that I can’t shine
It ain't a wrist or a chain that I can't rock
Tell ‘em I’m on something like city lights
I used to be out they sights, tinted like city nights
Now a nigga be city to city on plenty flights
You can tell ‘em I put on for my city in plenty fights
Tell ‘em I ain't gon lose they heated like I’mma tan 'em
I’m bout to throw ‘em in this drop with no ceilings so I can fan ‘em
Pull up on the bike same color the Phantom
And jump out on them haters just to tell ‘em I couldn’t stand ‘em

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I’m on top of my game yo
The OG Grand daddy kush, cocaine flow
I’m about that cash not that tango
Head shots, dump a whole clip in ya Kangol
Claim to be a real nigga we know you ain't though
I be in the hood, all the places you can’t go
Visuals, you can see the pictures I paint yo
Residuals, I just put it all in the bank yo, it’s pitiful
Hoes only after your bankroll
Stay off of the phone, watch out for the plain clothes
Yeah I rep my set, I ain't in the gang though
I protect my neck I carry the thing yo
I’m on the same shit that the boss is on
Do it for those in the Feds, up North or gone
I’m on a winning streak, I done got my losses on
It’s ironic cause even when I’m off I’m on
Yeah I’m on, uhh, what?

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
I’m on
I’m on
I’m on

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
Eternally grateful for the support, made the cover of The Source
Flashback to the ports the city of no remorse
Where they shooting back and forth like they playing horse
May the force be with you, bullet hit you
You bleed and I bleed with you
Mama please when you grieve, damn I grieve with you
This a preview, I see you in the summer, my new shit dumber
I’m on

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Life at the bottom is devastating
You’re hardly ever debated, the party is obligated
By suckers that wanna be you and never live with the Matrix
And never ever related to struggle and dedication
Your hustle is nominated, anonymous and you faded
The promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
They vomitted everytime that a rapper’s annihilated
Just wish them happy belated, fuck you I made it, I’m on

[Verse 6: B.o.B]
Tokyo to Amsterdam, Denver to LA
Minutes turn to hours and hours turn to pay
The days turn to nights but the nights never change
It’s funny how time is money" used to be a term of phrase
But now it’s company policy, I’m no spokesperson
No tricks, no gimmicks, no coercion
And they say, "Bob, man it’s good to have you back"
But I say, "I have been here, where the fuck have y'all been at?"

[Verse 7: Tyga]
Thinking how Pac lived at 22
That's ’93, I was four now I'm 22 on tour
One, two shots of my life, barely hold on
But I’m drawn to this feeling of adrenaline
With mic’s on, lights on and they gon’ applaud
Young nigga, Versace they never seen before
And they gon' watch me, wanna copy shit I got on
I’m too fly, I ain't got a flaw
Tell the law we above the law, God bless, amen every lost soul
And the group so good, went solo
Globe trotting, now I’m blowing up like an afro
Nigga thought you knew what I do
Rolling through ya area, double R coupe
Penthouse level now we only party on the roof
Bitch I’m a rebel so I move how I wanna move
Last King, YMCMB

[Verse 8: Gudda Gudda]
Used to run around the hood picking honies up
Now I’m doing shows around the world picking money up
Used to be slept on like a pillow
Went from trapping in a rental to rapping on instrumentals
Now its money on my mental and women get sentimental, huh
It’s cause the flow is sweet as a pack of skittles, nah
Yellow gold, yellow diamonds in the middle, nah
Stand up nigga, I was never known to sit around

[Verse 9: Bun B]
Well as the world spins around and around on its axis
Boys flip from town to town with the package
Stuffing bills and pounds and browns in a mattress
Sending clowns underground for practice
The fact is everybody wanna be the king with the crown
But never in the battle when the drama goes down
Easy to be the boss from behind the wall
But we gon see who really goes down when it’s time to brawl
Cause you gotta be careful about the image you portraying
You gotta show love to where you from all day
And when the going gets rough, don't get to going, get to staying
Put it down for your people and no delaying, know what I’m saying?

Girl I'll eat you up (Eat you up)
It's when you realize you're in Heaven
Like how'd you get there?

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She's impressed by a fat boy
Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy
Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy
Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it
Paid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it
She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard
Hustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it
Blue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force
Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job
Dogg pound niggas, and we came to fight
I was several million up before it came to light
Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it
Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music
Smoked out like a player and you know the name
Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game

Pitbull... lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die
Boxer... you take mine's off then hallelujah
Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times
Freaky... freak like it's the 80s
Fuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we
Should tone it... down with the clean version
Dirty... but in public you're like teen virgin
I like it... make me realize my vices
Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates
Private... meetin' inside your bedroom
Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room
It's a trophy in that pussy, I'mma cum in first place
I'mma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place
I'm your D-O-double-G and I need more Pedigree
What it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, ho

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Interlude: Anna Wise & Bilal]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent

Bulletproof my Chevy doors

Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Life to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me

[Chorus: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down
[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
"Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards"
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...
[Chorus: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service

Kendrick Lamar stopped by FADER offices recently in support of his major label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, out October 22nd on Aftermath/Interscope/Top Dawg. He declined to empty his pockets for a Things I Carry (“I’ve just got my license and a little money…”), but opened up about Barack Obama, being labeled a “conscious rapper” and Top Dawg Entertainment, the tight-knit label where he and the Black Hippy crew came up.

FADER: So tell us about the album.

Kendrick Lamar: It’s really just a self portrait. I feel like everything that people have asked me in interviews should be explained in this one album. How I’m able to think the way I think now—it had to come from a negative place first. Family issues, morals. All that is in one debut. I feel like it’s a whole new market of people that’s listening to me now, so it’s almost like a reintroduction to who I am and furthering that longevity.

F: Has being on a major label made things easier for you?

KL: It’s really just the same procedure. I’m still with this Top Dawg Entertainment company and we already ran this company like a major. Top Dawg: four individual kids off the streets, man, and really just gave them a domain to do something positive. We always did the work. We understood that if we wanted to be amongst the elite, we gotta conduct ourselves. So us joining forces with Interscope is basically a continuance of that, giving us an opportunity to do something constructive with ourselves, and the most positive high ever.

F: How’s it going with everybody? Ab-Soul’s album seems like it did well.

KL: I think every artist on the label is in a great space. We never wanted to present it as only one main artist in the camp. We wanted to solidify everybody as their own individual. That’s what’s happening now. You see Schoolboy Q’s taking off. [Jay] Rock already been there and still working. Ab-Soul. Everybody’s making their own lane and their own path to where people can’t look at it as if Top Dawg Entertainment is Kendrick Lamar. It’s all of us as a collective that’s representing this company.
Stream: Kendrick Lamar, “Backseat Freestyle” (Prod. by Hit-Boy)
F: The album looks like a picture of you as a baby at a house party. What’s the story behind that picture?

KL: I think the people that’ll really understand the cover and the significance of every little piece in the portraits is people that’s been rocking with me since day one. Those are real portraits. They’ll understand what that means way before they hear the album. I’m sure that paints a big, big picture of what I represent, coming from this place, but it’s what I’ve been talking about, the lifestyle and putting a positive light on it at the end of the day.

F: That runs through so much of your music, this uplifting spin on things.

KL: There’s so much negativity in the world today. People know what’s real and know what’s fake. They know who really lived it and who’s trying to live it. That’s what I think people rock with me genuinely, because they know I’m not out here trying to glorify certain situations through these records or say I’m the biggest killer in the world. I don’t believe in none of these rappers anyway. The real gangsters, you never really see their faces because they’re either in the ground, in prison or behind the scenes.

F: What is people’s biggest misconception about you?

KL: Early on, when I started really getting attention, I seen a lot of blogs and a lot of media try to classify my music as one particular thing. That was like the “conscious” thing. It’s crazy, because they define it after just one project, certain things I was talking about. I never wanted that. I never want people to classify my music. That went out the window once I dropped a record called “Ignorance Is Bliss.” It was street, it was West Coast, it was a little bit more wisdom, and a person can’t really fake that. They figured out it wasn’t just the introspective side. At the end of the day, I want people to recognize me as just a human being, period. I talk about whatever I feel and whatever I go through.

F: What makes you happiest right now?

KL: It’s a few things. One, this influence I have on my community, on my city. I’m doing something in a positive light for these kids out here. A few of my homeboys, they’re locked up, they got kids and they’re going straight to jail as soon as they have these babies. Their sons, they’re five, six years old now. They’re looking at me to do something different. Their fathers respect that. So when their kid can see me on TV and get excited about it and know that I came from the same place they came from, that’s a great feeling to accomplish. That’s definitely a great feeling because I know it’s gonna start from that small place, that community in Compton, and eventually speed around the world. I wanna spark that idea in my own backyard first.

F: In another interview recently that you said you don’t vote. Has anyone given you a hard time for saying that?

KL: No. It was my own personal opinion and they know I’m true to myself. I’m not knocking the kids not to go out there and do it. Do it and get that experience. I gained that experience, it’s just a personal thing within myself and where I’m at in my life and how I feel about the world and spiritually. It has nothing to do with Obama. I want Obama to get that spot because I know he has a good heart. It’s just the people behind him. You have some people that say I’m in a space now where I disregard the people that are still struggling. That’s bullcrap, because at the end of the day, I’ve been thinking the same way since I was 16 years old. My whole thing is: people always look at the high places to come back down and help these communities, but at the end of the day, it starts with the people that’s in the communities. That’s what I really wanna stress.

[DJ Dave]
Man, how long you been, how long you been rappin' for?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I been doin' this professionally, uh, four or five years. Professionally, uh, recording as a career; not on the block freestylin'...

[DJ Dave]
Y'all know, y'all know DJ Dave. Y'all know how it go, on the interviews and shit. I-I know we wil'in', but your boy's under the weather right now. But we gon' keep pushin'. Now-now-now the "Top Dawg" in your tee, like that...

[Kendrick]
Top Dawg, Jay Rock, nigga. Brotha-from-anotha. You know how we get down, slave in this motherfucka. Hey y'all niggas - y'all niggas better get - y'all motherfuckin' - stay in the studio, man. You know what I mean? Niggas be like, "Damn, Dot. Where you be at, nigga?" I be in - I be in the streets too. But nigga, we in this mothafuckin' lab all day, pumpin' it hard on you niggas. So when y'all hear this shit, and y'all be like, "Damn, them niggas be on some shit." Yeah, nigga, 'cause we in this mothafucka all day. We sleep in this mothafucka. I ain't lie when I said I sleep in the booth, nigga. Y'know what I mean? That's the big homie dude, though, nigga. We be in this mothafucka, slavin' on these shits man, you know what I mean? So... you know. It is what it is

[DJ Dave]
Hey, bro. Not strayin' away from your Jay Rock situation, again. Umm...

[Kendrick]
Yeah, yeah, Jay Rock

[DJ Dave]
What's y'all relationship? As... as, uh... I know y'all relationship, 'cause I'm around

[Kendrick]
Yeah, yeah, straight up

[DJ Dave]
But, for the people that don't know, what's you and Jay Rock's relationship?

[Kendrick]
Uh, shit. Beyond the music shit, you know how most of these rap niggas be. You know, you know what I mean. Shit, we like - we like brothers in this shit. You know what I mean? We gon' - we discuss more than just music and politics and all that other shit that come with this industry shit. You know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin', so... I met him before the music shit, so, you know. Nigga, we like brothers, nigga. If I say that's my brother, nigga, you know what I mean?



[DJ Dave]
Everybody think they can rap, and everybody starting they record labels and everybody pushin' out they songs And if that's what y'all wanna do, go hard. But what separates our company from their company?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Consistency, man. You know, just, you know, perfect your craft, man. Try to block out all that other shit, man, just worry about your craft. Business, and the business will fall in place

Like my nigga J Black say:

"Change is coming"



[DJ Dave]
Oh, okay, okay. I understand that. Okay, now, for uhh people who don't know, where'd you grow up at, man? Like, you know, what type of city. What area?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, Compton. Straight Compton. No sides. No - just - niggas used to roll down Rosecrans, we used to be bumpin' that - pops used to be bumpin' that NWA shit. And, uh, shit - you know, "cruise down that street in my 6-4." We wasn't in no 6-4 though. We was in the brown dukie van and shit, same color as dukie

(laughs)

Know what I'm talkin' bout? But uh, yeah, we'd bump that shit all day

[DJ Dave]
Oh, okay. And what influenced you to become, you know, a rapper?

[Kendrick Lamar]
You know, the typical person would say, uh, "other rappers." I'mma be straight up honest, when I found out I was dope - Next question...

[DJ Dave]
You have yo' shit be pre-prepared or ya' know what's your process? What's your songwriting process? You here to be- do you break out a pen and pad and go at it hard or how you do it then?

[Kendrick Lamar]
I- I hear the beat first, people. I hear the beat first and then I just go wherever the beat is tellin' me... just like all of the- ya' know all the other greats say

[DJ Dave]
What, no pen and no pad?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Maybe

[DJ Dave]
I mean but that seems kinda'.. you know like-

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah no pen, no pad then. (No pen no pad.)

[DJ Dave]
Aight yeah! but I mean aye I just- that's what I see. I mean but is that- does- does that- is that like the breaking point to- to really break you away from other artists that- you know that puts all the artists that don't use pen and a pads a different realm?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Naw, it just- it just a- a challenge, you know? You know Jay and Big ya' know were doin' it way back you know what I'm sayin'? It's just you know- I dunno, it's almost starting to become a cliché now, you know what I'm sayin'- I might fuckin back hop on the pen. Naw but uh (laughs) But yeah- but naw. You know. It's all- it's all- it's- it don't matter in- at the end of the day you know, whatever makes-[Harmonizing "blood in the bullshit" for 46 seconds]
[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers

(Inserts cassette tape)

Interviewer: What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pac's new one?
Kendrick: Pac's loud, man
Interviewer: Right, but don't you feel like that creates.. uh.. tension between East and West? He's talking about killing people; "I had sex with your wife"...
Kendrick: I talk about it, too. I talk about murder; I talk about violence; I talk about all of that. But, not to glorify it. To educate you on it; to know that it's real

(Kendrick talking over instrumental:)
Fifth-teen, um, le-let's go to thirteen
Hmm, walking from home
Police pull up on the side of you
"Ay, you look like so-and-so"
"I'm not so-and-so"
"You are so-and-so"
"Get in the car and let's take this ride"
"Get out the car; you're not so-and-so; we don't need you"
That's one of the stories
(Compton, California)
Compton, California for you

[Backing Instrumental]
My day one motherfucking fans in this building, one time. As I look around-this the shit. I ain't been this intimate in a long time. We might be up here all motherfucking night, I got something. I ain't seen y'all in a minute, real shit. You know I mean it when I say, I been around the world and shit. A whole sea of people. But nothing like coming right here in front of this small group. The people that's been with me since day one. Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothefucking-.80. Real shit. This is cool right here goddamn, this is really cool right now. This about real shit, listen up. To Pimp a Butterfly. People said a lot about this album. That'd said album of the year, that' said album of this generation and all that shit. That's cool, but also real shit making this motherfucking album was therapy. Not only for you, but for me, You know what I'm saying? Because within six months of good kid, m.A.A.d city dropping, the life of what I knew, when I knew what it was, thinking I knew, that completely changed within six months. And uh, you going through the motional of the world telling you that you're great. And you trying to make yourself believe that shit, but it's hard because you're institutionalized from where you come from. Still trying to move around and stay the way I like I do. I'm a low-key nigga. And I ain't scared of the world. Me personally, I can't run around with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I don't need to, I don't want to. And that's just been me since day one. So trying to grasp the idea of them telling you who you should run with, it can't cut it. Because like I said on the Kendrick Lamar EP, "I need to be me goddamnit". I think this shit can live forever, but looking at y'all faces y'all just. I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherfucking fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). To Pimp a Butterfly. Y'all allowed this motherfucking album has soared all the way to the top with no motherfucking commercial success. Y'all allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and shit. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherfucking market all the time. This shit belong to you and you only, you know what I'm saying? Some shit that y’all can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherfucking tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that shit. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the shit that I want to perform, you dig what I'm saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a Butterfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this shit. So with that being said, we gon' rock this shit until the casket drop or until, until it all falls down. Let's go[Intro]
Greetings people
You're now rockin' with the best
Hub City's threat
Minor of the year
K.Dot
I know the hood's been waitin', right
I'mma stop being stingy
I'mma share with y'all

[Verse]
Whoever thought young Kendrick would spit so ignorant
Make street disciples go and get a membership
Streets revival like Creflo Dollar hustlin' on the strip
This is church
Advise you to purchase it or copy the worst
Y'all rhymes sloppy, I rhyme properly
I jam pack Monopoly dollars by puttin' 100% in every verse
Add 10% more and what do you get
A skinny nigga manipulatin' the innocent
I have no sense, ever since the Rodney King riots
Mind militant, nigga don't try it
Try to hold the peace, for I promote violence
Y'all don't rap
Y'all make a lotta noise like sirens
So I'm here to shut shit down
The four pound decorate your city
Make over your town
I'm not Diddy, but still a bad boy
'Til the reaper come get me, follow me now
Where no man has stepped, no man has repped
No man can withstand all the nights I've slept
Under my sheets, no life, thinkin' 'bout death
Fuckin' with me, you just might lose your breath
I'll take you to them pearly gates
Them golden streets
Plus a cute little casket so your body can sleep
The Hub City shit is me
[Outro]
Do you believe
It's Kendrick the God[K.Dot]
Weezy Up, K.Dot

[Wayne]
The homie K.Dot, he crazy too

[K.Dot]
Love

[Wayne]
I cosign this, shout out to my homie Jay Rock too, he's my nigga too

[Jay Rock]
Your nigga? Shit

[Wayne]
You're my homie I'm telling you
I co-sign it[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
HiiPOWER
Sox Gang
I'm wearing black pumas, hair like Kunta
Kendrick Lamar
'Bout eight of them in the studio
And the all want me
Fuck you niggas bruh
Skeme whaddup

[Verse 1: Skeme]
If I come off as unconcern, (yeah) please forgive me
I ain't even poured the sizzurp yet (nah)
I'm on this remy, if my phone going straight to voice mail
Bitch Im busy, I ain't got the time to talk
Every tick I'm repping my city (whoop)
Ten bottles at a time, this here is the life
And how I'm living might be wrong
But in this world what the fuck is right
It's just one rapper, 2 cups, 3 bitches blowing me
Heard it's 20 niggas in the VIP, then bitch you know it's me
I'm here for niggas go and do them bizz
Getting tired of hearing rappers just rapping the shit I live
All that I got is my all, that's exactly what I get
And I need my toilet paper every time I do my shit
Guess I should switch, cause I'm getting paid
Instead of worrying bout how I'm getting money, just do the same, bitch
The bright lights and people screaming my name
Fuck the money and the fame, bitch that's the reason I came
[Hook]
I remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
I remember, I remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
I remember oh my, how the times change
Nothing's the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows the name
Oh my, how the times change
Nothing's the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows my name

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Driving on a freeway full of darkness
It's just me and plus my heart is cold
As an project carpet
You be coughing up commode
Full of shit see I was told
That only real niggas can harvest any future pot of gold
And look at you, I know you starving, see it's burning in your soul
And you look for me to console your emotions
I'm on the road and I'm joking with all my niggas
We laughing at you the feeling of victory is a gig
And I hope they catch you whenever you fall from the pedestal you was on
And don't get me wrong, you was in the zone of a lifetime
But the place you belong is the bottom
That's why I got a bullet for every ego or tuxedo
And some scenos, a combination that we know
Uh, tight rope, but I notice they walk a thin line
From having the disabilities of deaf, dumb and blind
Every time I recline, then remind myself
I would never die with pussy, less it was on my dick, pussy
[Hook]
I remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
I remember, I remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
I remember oh my, how the times change
Nothing's the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows the name
Oh my, how the times change
Nothing's the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows my name

[Verse 3: Bryan Roberts]
Staring out a benz window, thinking bout saying fuck it
I make it and spend it all
Middle finger for a budget
Got your rent off in my pocket, and spent off a piece of luggage
Got a lot of bad habits, with money, some shit I'm stuck with (yeah)
Nothing but dollars in my discussion, show my ass out in public
Cause motherfuckers love it, I hear (bitch)
Niggas out here plotting on the come up
I hold this gun up, then one of these coward niggas run up
My nigga dead, so for him I'm lighting my blunt up
I say "hustle for this rap bitch, I'm getting this from sun down to sun up"
I know it's niggas hating, praying I never make it
But jealous pussy I'm here, and I'm never leaving just face it (whoop)
Before one of these niggas take me out this motherfucking game
Promise I do my motherfucking thing
Do what the fuck I want, motherfucker lame
I just keep it 100, fuck breaking down for some change
Nigga I just stay the same
[Hook]
I remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
I remember, I remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
I remember oh my, how the times change
Nothing's the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows the name
Oh my, how the times change
Nothing's the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows my name[Produced by Rahki]​​

[Sample]
This is a world premiere!
This is a world premiere!

[Intro]
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

[Chorus]
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love my... self
(One day at a time, sun gonna shine)
[Verse 1]
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (crazy!)
What you gonna do? (what you gonna do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you (haunt you)?
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this

[Chorus]
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love my... self
(One day at a time, sun gonna shine)

[Verse 2]
They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood, and a mob of police
And a rock on the corner, and a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean, and a model on the scene, yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
[Chorus]
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love my... self
(One day at a time, sun gonna shine)

[Bridge]
Walk my bare feet (walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (down, down valley deep)
Fi-fie-fo-fum (fi-fie-fo-fum) (I love myself)
My heart undone (my heart undone) (I love myself)

[Hook]
The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
(I love myself)
But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind
(I love myself)
He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide
(I love my... self)
One day at a time, sun gonna shine
(Hold up)
[Verse 3]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
I went to war last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"

[Outro]
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh, woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry (i)

[Car Horns][Intro: Angela McCluskey, Kendrick Lamar]
Sit still, and close your eyes (Smoke to it)
What's behind the other door, oh
No more silence, don't kill this thing we got called love
Just searching for the perfect shot

[Hook: Angela McCluskey]
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to write rhymes, all day and all night
While you were playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscious only knew whats half tight
At 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
This is a dog's fight, my nigga
The soundtrack to life, my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party, and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
That's because that's these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers
The good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome
Where is the love?
[Hook: Angela McCluskey, Kendrick Lamar]
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling (Where is the love?), don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Give me rings, give me chains, mane
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some land, or maybe I'll land a, G5
Clearport, say hello to the man
Give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
My name 'til they strain the veins in they vocal cords
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
Manahattan and 40/40, no 40's but rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar, this is me
And that's love

[Hook: Angela McCluskey]
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody smoke to it, for this is, the celebration

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
It ain't hard to tell that I live in hell
Sin City watch city gotta get your mail
How I sleep when I die that's real
There's only two ways out: living under the dirt or life in the cell
I'm still on the block tryna make me a sell
You can't make too much, some niggas might tell
That's how it is homie, when you up in your shit
Get locked up, your friends might hook on your bitch
Its fuck a ho, that's why I'm all about my chips
To live and die broke, it's some embarrassing shit
That's why I'm hooking a block, fuck hooking a bitch
When the wars on, I'm bustin' em clips
Shit I'm just trying to stack paper
Blowing big weed, I'm high like a skyscraper
L.A nigga in a New York state of mind
When I rhyme verses like Cool J back in '85, I'm hot lava
Gold d's on my low rider 4'5 so original like a ol' timer
2 pistols, one llama
In the back of the trunk like who want drama? nobody
Sitting back I got this, a project prophet
I could predict when my goons ready to pop shit
When the funds is low
We're on the hunt for tons of blow
Summer time, in Cali homie all we do is snow
Counting dollars, til our hands get callused
Won't stop hustling til the judge bang the gaval
Prayin' for the better days
Sit in the club celebrate
Pop bottles, with top models back on the interstate
Traffic and chickens homie we trying to get it
Then we back in the kitchen whipping like a chemist
Hunger pangs got me acting a fool in that dinner time
Life is like a racing track trying to get to the finish line

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Slaughter pigs like farmer John
My style got its own ambience
You feel my presence? live life like everyday class in session
Learn something after 187 we burn some
For real kid, our uncle doing a 13 year bid
I pray to god he don't come out how he went in
Gets ill, these streets got me packing a 9 mill
My mind stay black, either kill or be killed
It's real in the battlefield son
Last week shawty do wop he at the ooh wop he said he ready to kill some
I said shawty chill, you ain't ready for that type of drama
Plus karma for real
He shook his head, horizontal
He said he was out on consignment some dudes on the block tried to rob em
Try? what you mean?
He said they tried until I reached in to the pocket of my jeans
I killed 2, but one got away which is bad news, because the hood didn't even cover my whole face
And I know he be back, but before he do that
I bring it to him first on the porch where he live at
Damn shawty I can't knock you, its survival of the fittest
With that said, do what you got to
I shook his hand, then I walked away, then reality took a toll on me
Shoulda never gave him that .38
Looking at the ceiling in my bedroom
Then the phone rang, hey K Dot turn on the news
They didn't even say his name
But I knew it was him when it said another 7th grader was slayed
It ain't hard to tell

[Lyrics from Snippets]

[Intro: Colin Clive]
It's alive, it's moving
It's alive, oh it's alive
It's alive, it's alive
It's alive in the name of god
Now I know what it feels like to be god

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm not a newcomer, I'm a new wonder elite

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
K-Dizzle
I rap with a Pyrex in the projects
I'm crack in a pot, I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate on a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You cannot test no key in the Tesla

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
It's alive

[Originally produced by Dr. Dre / Remixed by MC Wike]

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga?
My last album was The Chronic
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
It's Alive

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, repping 213
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I rap with a Pyrex
In the projects
I'm crack in a pot
I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate
On a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You can not test no key in a Tesla
Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras, ah

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on]
[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on]
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
[When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward]

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
For someone start with my nigga Al Mack
The first real nigga I lost
Even though he used to gang bang
We'll never be able to see his chain swang
But that's that Jesus piece lost
Cause he would have rocked it well
But instead he rocked that hair full of braids braided by his girl Leesi
With the semi on, nigga had game kinda cold
Never killed a soul, so he never had a problem
With thinking hisself was gettin' old
Livin' life like it never would happen
Shit, niggas dyin' like life really goin' full circle
Thought we was gon' live to see it all
'Til that day that he died on a head-on collision with a motorcycle

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
California economics, killer assignments
School test scores drop, murder rates climbin'
Scarface where you watch, try to reenact
And launched over the balcony, buck shots in our backs
Every day casualties got me losin' my sanity
Cannons be within arm reach, I'm all panicky
Last week I had a run in with my enemy's friend
Shit, finna be dead man quick
Grab the pistola, hollup, complimentary of the cig
But then the boys rolled up, we both admit
Close call, the ghetto is like a quick game of tennis ball
You're probably well preserved until you get served
Through the knowledge I get a few dollars, you gettin' demolished
If you cruise through Compton wearin' red or blue
See colors in these niggas eyes
Is like a favorite color bein' told by the blind, don't really matter
[Verse 3: BJ the Chicago Kid]
I met Jamico when I went to high-school
They stayed around the corner bur shit, I never knew
Me and Kisel Ken in the basement playing drums, making music
While she fussin' yellin down the stairs, I'm on the phone you losers
I remember late for school every morning thirsty for that Mickey D's
Not knowin' the death of her mother matured her very quickly
So we gon' fast forward school graduated, went to college got married
They had a pretty little girl but the world couldn't make her tardy
Died from a seizure at her daughter's birthday party

[Hook]

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
Uhn, Blue chucks, swing Glocks, they both in my pants
I'm a gangsta I can do no wrong
Fuck with the lights on, and say I love you baby
Cause tomorrow may not make it to me
I got a kilo and a seven series, when a crown went crack, nigga
I bet the gun sale plat, oh
ATF be on that sucker shit
They hate a black nigga with getting money's involved
Got an ounce in my draws
I just wanna live forever my nigga
Took the blue pill, crack the axillae
If Q said it then you know that shit real
Pistol grip up, on my lap all times
I used to drive a Honda, with the dimes inside
Now drive by is by the marks that killed Bebe's kids
So the gun is who my role model is, The illest Crip in a Benz
Look, I'm never half of my steppin', I'm never not with my weapon
So you'll get got in a second like
[Hook]

[Verse 5: Punch]
Gotta understand my disposition, see I was raised a little different
Disenchanted former county check recipient
Reminiscin' of a Mexican immigrant
'Cept the border's my existence, stripped away my innocence
Constantly conflicted over color restrictions
You outta your district, you end up on a milk carton missin'
That's average every day California livin'
Race riots in the yard spill outside of the prison
Besides the killings, West Coast cap peelin'
This California lifestyle was so appealin'
Imagine the women, exotic cars, custom driven
You on your Hollywood thing, what a beautiful feelin', ain't it?
Such a perfect picture painted
Yet it's tainted by the unfortunate and less famous
I ain't complainin', it's home
Just somethin' to ride to when you're off in the zone

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
This a little somethin' you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, niggas will ride and smoke you
This a little somethin' you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, niggas will ride and smoke you
Wanna be involved with the underworld dealers
East Coast bodyers, West Coast cap peelers
Wanna be involved with the underworld dealers
East Coast bodyers, West Coast cap peelers

[Hook: Juicy J]
I want all the kush
I want all the bottles
I want all the cash
I want all the models
I want it all
I want it all

[Verse 1: B. Martin]
Ok, kush, bottles, shut up, swallow
Tonight I'm living life like there's no tomorrow
Got a couple girls in the Benz
And they all got friends, headed back to the condo
And I make all they asses clap, clap, clap, bravo
I want that lottery money
That “please don't say hi to me” money
That 'I could go back to my hometown
And get my city outta poverty' money
Don't lie to me honey, I know that thang fake
Put a candle on that ass, tell her “give me that cake”, wait
I rep NY, big boy in the big city
Shout out, 5 burroughs, the upper state, just ride with me
Now come drink on this bottle, and smoke out on this kush
Now let's fade away, and let Juicy go make it rain on that hook
Look

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell him I do Deniro, tell him you do Camaro
I do a fast car, something like a Nascar
Move like a sh-sh-sh-shooting star
And they know who we are, big pimping in the building
Got about a million, throw it at the ceiling
Layin smack dead in the face of civilians
Tell 'em I'm chilling with Patron on ice
And my home on ice, and my neck on ice
Lo-lo-lo-look at my ring, I'm a hustler string
You should learn me twice
I'mma grind till I die, that's no lie
Do with my middle finger held up high
Fuck the world, if it fry
I know one thing, I did my job
And that's get what? Move, tell a lie
Sippin on Henny, smokin on ly
Never let a penny pass me by
Move with the Benjis by my side
That's my sidekick, you better watch it
What I mean is, don't touch my pockets
Man big debts, cut them checks
Hundred mill plus, nothing less

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B. Martin]
Tell 'em I do [?], tell 'em they do kius
Tell 'em I got a couple girls in the Benz, and they extra sexy like ES
PN your boy got game, the magic wanna do the vein
Not ready but I'm way Kendick, so I say F it to all you lames
It's my time, it's my watch, homie
Y'all don't believe me just watch, only
Time will tell but I'll rhyme until I skip time, I'm Michael J. Fox
Got 86 on that dash, got 87 in cash, and I'm born in '88
Born and raised in New York, so you do the math
Pass that dutch, oh
I'mma get a little high now, get a little rush
So I take a little ride to the lower east side, hit the 169
Probably find one girl who was 6'9”
With another girl by the end of the night
I'm her suitor, I can tell the future
I'mma fuck them both at the same damn time

[Hook x2]



[Hook: Major James]
I ain't worried about these niggas trynna hate on me
To me it's all just jealousy
Don't wanna see another brother get his money
So I roll on, roll on, roll on ,roll on
Everyday stay fresh and stiffy
And oh boy your girl is out to get me
Man the streets is filled with envy
So I roll on
Roll on
Roll on

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Rolling up the cronic, isn't it ironic
My money rolling like Sonic
Divas in my lap up and down like hydraulics
Got a pimp player degree but never did college
Niggas steady hating when you steady getting dollars
Got 99 issues your bitch ain't part of my problem
Used to be broke now I'm getting cabbage
Got marble on the floors in my project palace
No more crack money getting paid off my ballads
Went from dirty money to visas you see my balance
Welcome to my habitat East side gutter
I could whip you a cookie, best believe it's gonna be butter
Then I hit the club pissy drunk of that bubba
Gotta stay high 'til I die motherfucker
I'mma get this money while you niggas envy
Haters want me to schh
Then come and get me
Please

[Hook: Major James]
I ain't worried about these niggas trynna hate on me
To me it's all just jealousy
Don't wanna see another brother get his money
So I roll on, roll on, roll on ,roll on
Everyday stay fresh and stiffy
And oh boy your girl is out to get me
Man the streets is filled with envy
So I roll on
Roll on
Roll on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick Lamar, young nigga
Before I ever wear a chain, I make sure you know my name
I'm the same good kid from the block where you was raised
Didn't have a pot to piss in peeing in your pj's
You see my story is a story untold by the kid from Compton making straight a's for new clothes
Surrounded by bullets from one of my relatives foes
Because he been a killer since he was 12 years old
The price of being guilty by association got me places I ain't ever been
Like in back of the swap meet niggas trynna test my chin
Squaring up like a nerd before summer school begin
Then break when bullets breaks wind
All I wanna do is rap
But it's a wrap
When you living inside of Iraq and
George Bush in the culdesac
You get pushed and you righteous act
It's a murder charge on your back
Can I captivate this captive before you try peel my cap
Can I live
Huh
Kendrick Lamar



[Verse 1: Punch]
I'm still lost in my own zone in the living room
Like I'm dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway
Patron shots I consume taking the pain away
Each sip bring me closer to my doom
Sun shining bright through the crack in the blind
Thinking to myself this morning what happened to time
It's passing away, the world decides, it ain't what it used to be
Everything I love don't mean what it used to mean
For example spitting a 16
No thrills, feeling numb like i'm of Thorazine
It used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap thing
Now I'm just trying to trap cream
Enough drowning in my sorrow, never put off tomorrow
What you can do today, that's my new motto
With that said, I roll out the bed
Hit the showers, it's time to get this bread, now make dollars

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning
Cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats
So me without one is like I'm dated
I'd be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80's had favored
I'm one of the best of my Homo Sapiens
One of the best of God's creations
He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
I know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, I can feel you hating
Serving mc's like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented
Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony
Half of these niggas ain't half of me
Half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity
Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
Actually, Kurt, Co-Bain
Ten years in my career, pray to God that I don't blow up my brains Lord, I'm here
Great Depression, I don't know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans;
They cost so much
(?) Usher
Either way i'm caught up in materialistic
Anything that's custom, best believe I'mma get it
Getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
The home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
No matter the crime rate I still remain content
Moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars
Then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend
I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
(Holla) - x4

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I woke up this morning, counting my cash
Girls calling me now, straight throwing the ass
I threw on my T, I grabbed my bitch
Laced up my chucks, rock sharp as a piece
They used to call me a creature, but now I'm a beast
With my voice on the beat, I'm the voice of the streets
From my head to the feet, I'm bad to the bone
Nigga, I won't stop, 'till I'm add to the throne
Dog, I ride with the chrome, gotta be safe in this shit
Call me Pharrell, boy, I keep me them Clipse
I don't ride on no skateboard, I roll with some grinders
Trapped in the hood, far from Giligans Island
I was a drug dealer, but now I'm a wild spitter
Nigga, I'm more iller, call me a hospital
You got the hiccups, I got this fluent as shit nigga
I spit a bar, straight ruin your shit nigga
Known as a mack, I can influence your bitch
I'm the reason these niggas be handcuffin' them quick
I'm the reason these bitch niggas be playa hating on us
See them in the streets, these niggas don't be saying nothing
But keep on talking, you ain't ready for beef
Jay Rock down to bust a nigga head in the streets
I can't help it, the hood flow through my blood
This gangbangin shit, should be considered a drug
Everybody doing it now, I see you rap niggas
Wrong place, wrong time, that's how you get clapped nigga
Raised in the projects, money my object
They standing in my way, like a frog I dissect them
You'll get shot walking through my section
Now you a verse all in my session, they say life is a school
Everyday is a lesson, well I get kicked out, shit got me guessing
Shit naw, check my ghetto report card, straight A student in every class up in the Gardens
Money over bitches, nigga i'm heartless
Money over bitch niggas, rich is my target
(target) - x4

And I don't trust these niggas, they be tellin' on me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
If you know me then you know
Nigga, Chi-town like my second home
I done flew a private jet for some Harold's Chicken straight from Rome
I done bust down on a few thots, Fredo hit me on my phone
"Nigga, I can't talk right now, gnom-gnom-gnom-gnom
Got pussy on my tongue."
I got worry on my brain, I been gone all summer
Just to fly back home and found out y'all done killed my little brother
Shit is fucked up on these streets
Why the fuck would I think about some rap beef?
Nigga, I got bigger fish to fry now
Empty out my account and I'll pay for sleep (8-8-8-808 Mafia)
Where's my bottle?
Money change and people change
And people come and people go and act estranged
I'm aggravated 'cause they hated
Confirmation for success anticipated
I can taste it, I can chase it back down with liquor
I could drown out my sorrows
But I ain't a sorry-ass nigga
Get up off your ass, make yourself a hundred racks
Bitch, get up off your ass, throw it back back back
Back inside my 'Bach, back in a garage that we can jack
Bitch, I love my hood, I'm strapped up, what's good?
Heard someone said— (8-8-8-808 Mafia)

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
These niggas changed, they got jealous on me
Try to rob, I got that felon on me
I can't leave the country 'cause I'm a felon, homie
And I don't trust these niggas, they be tellin' on me
And I don't trust these bitches, they be plottin' on me
Everybody ain't real, you gotta watch, homie
Niggas say they real, but they actin' funny
These niggas changed and got jealous on me

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Comin' up, gotta watch who you hang with
I'm still with the same niggas I came with
On the block with the same niggas I banged with
If you ain't talkin' money I don't know your language
I come from that very very bottom
Now I'm gettin' money and I'm seein' stardom
My niggas savage, don't start 'em
We up them guns if it's a fuckin' problem
Money comin' in, don't have money problems
Kicked your bitch out 'cause she ain't wanna swallow
All these bitches thots actin' like models
Fredo, I'm the king of Chicago
Got a .30 and I fill it up with hollows
Got bricks and I feel like El Chapo
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit, bitch
Since I'm a rich nigga, I need a rich bitch

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
These niggas changed, they got jealous on me
Try to rob, I got that felon on me
I can't leave the country 'cause I'm a felon, homie
And I don't trust these niggas, they be tellin' on me
And I don't trust these bitches, they be plottin' on me
Everybody ain't real, you gotta watch, homie
Niggas say they real, but they actin' funny
These niggas changed and got jealous on me



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges brought up
I shook my head, turned around then found a $100

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar (x2)]
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy



[Hook: Kendrick Lamar (x2)]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
Closed my eyes then asked myself how I was feeling
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willing
I came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window
See my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this is meant for
Me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar (x2)]
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar and BJ the Chicago Kid]
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
So I can bless you

[Verse 4: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Lord help me
Cause I need You
I know this weed is burning
And I'm on drink number two
But it's all to soothe the pain from this
Cold, cold world
Sometimes I think You can help me
But this bus here is temporary
So I'm talking to You
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
Birds dropping out the sky, daughters having their fathers' babies
And this the news I hear
When my god kids, nieces, and nephews turn a year
I wonder, will it get better
A little cheddar, when it get better
But the rest of that's cash
Make last year's Christmas gift you, my bad

[Hook 3: BJ the Chicago Kid (x2)]
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow

[Verse 5: BJ the Chicago Kid]
If I just keep the faith
I know You'll be right there
Sometimes it may not seem that You are there
But You're there
I feel You're there
You're everywhere
And I thank You for
Protecting me in these streets
From danger seen and unseen
I never know
What happened the night
I wasn't there
Something told me leave so I left
It was the next morning
Three got shot after the club
All listening to that small voice
Oh you saved my life

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Too many opinions in the glasshouse
This world full of ego, let me cash out

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
Jump in that—, jump in that bitch (Ho)
Jump in that— (Ho), jump in that bitch (Ho)
Jump in that— (Ho, ho), jump in that—
(Jump in that bitch)
(Fuck nigga)
Jump in that bitch, run in that bitch
Jump in that-jump in that bitch

[Verse: Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar]
Two trench coats in the bag
Baby Keem, king of rap
And I think he just came back
How the fuck did I go back? (pgLang)
Get your case off my back (pgLang)
That my son, wait, relax (It's the language)
Beat my son, go to your room (pgLang, pgLang)
Stop sneak-dissin', that ain't bool
Play both sides, huh
She love all my guys, huh

Real rap, I knock rhymes right off of your skull cap
You can't see me when I step into the booth
Your wish list, K.Dot, yeah I'm the truth
Stuntin, you'd better get your broom
Cause I'm flying with witches and we're going to the moon
With this album, debut at that
I'm so fly I might float with the bats
Y'all know the most
Biggie and Pac, they behind me as my ghosts
Cause you think they write for me when I step into the drop
My shit is so sweet, candy flavored, no you're not
Skeletons in my closet
And no, you can't get up off it
This the freestyle, trick or treat
Halloween, better come with me, I'm sweet
Pumpkins, smacking them across they head
And I'm pokin' eyeballs out on the web instead
He gonna gonna keep going
Baby, sex tape killed me
Ye, ye, I'm so fly, right now I'm so high
Matter of fact oh we talking about the hurricane
I'm talking about New York, I pray for y'all, know what I mean
I don't want that to happen, cuz if so I might just start rapping
Kim Kardashian, Wiz did that ass in
[Laughter]
Coming straight from Compton, I thought y'all know
I ain't gonna look at the cards yet, cause I'm 'bout to flow
Matter fact, this the perfect part to talk about them Lakers
Everybody that's disrespecting, y'all the fakers
We gonna keep going, off the top of the dome
Mavs, y'all gonna go home
Teach y'all to come back to my city
Shrink you, G
Five times, four times, that's the repeat
Obama, we ain't gonna talk about Ritt Momney
Because he's whack, fugazi, fugazi
I don't need to talk about the flow that I'm in
If you gonna vote, vote for Obama
He's gonna win, fo sho
And we gonna keep on going
Off the top, we just gonna keep on flowing
We gonna get back to this little punk, he's crap
Mitt Romney, show 'em how to rap
Matter fact, this freestyle is just dedicated to him
You're homeboys right now with Slim
Your chances, you're not gonna win
You need to go back to where you came from, boy
It's the ruler of the game
Obama, vote now homeboy, he's got change
What's up

[Verse 1]
Two shot the diligence

[Bridge]
I slide on my hater like skrrt (woah, woah, woah)
I’m killing this shit don’t get murked (woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
Two shot the diligence
No more reminiscing on who shot, we finish it
Blade runner, walking on thin ice, admit it is
Hot feet running, I been nice, I’m it, legit[Produced by Tae Beast]

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only 17
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give it all to her daddy but she don't know her father
That's ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen
What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind
She made it where nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour
She suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure
Of a black man, white man, needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
10 months before she was 10 he moved in
And that's when he touched her
This mothafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park
I seen the El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind
She made it where nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder
Left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
My little sister 11, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard, oh
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Verse 1]
I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck a stage name, that's the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify within this business
I'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rap
Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap?
I never killed a man, never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
But this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
So just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul?
I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, "Hell no"
They say anything worth having is worth the wait
Well, I want the world, tell me how long that takes
There's no time like now, I can cut my patience short
Or give 'em some more gowns, I don't even want the crown
I just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when I get it
You won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own business?
A rich nigga buy anything you sell him
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
Well I'm a broke nigga, but still I wouldn't listen to you
Even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga, pfttuh

[Verse 2]
See I was brought up different
Whatever that my pops said, for sure I'd listen
You said you did dirt, but I can't dig it
It don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
Oh-no-oh-oh
I swear we got to fast-forward, before time flies by
My new saying for '0-10 is, why lie?
And if you ain't trying to win, then why try?
Now you can low-ball or give me high five
This is I nigga, look into my eye

[Hook]
Nigga, I am Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, pfttuh

[Verse 3]
And that used to be a hell of a task
Now I'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
My character like it don't carry a confidence
That can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash
I'm bout to cash in my thoughts
Give you a compass, then tell you get lost
What I'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
Once the Eves come, they quick to stare at him
Hoping I don't take their bitch, but I'm on some other shit
When I'm done, I'm tryna run the government
These are big dreams, transition from a rapper to a human being
You can't 'school' a dean
I be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience
All cause they all a facade, my God
Y'all be out partying, I be stealing your audience
All because who I are, Lamar

[Hook]
But my first name, it gotta be Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, now let's go

But we can't go... backwards

Uh, Martin tenía un sueño
Martin tenía un sueño
Kendrick tiene un sueño

[Coro]
Toda la vida he querido dinero y poder
Respeta mi pensamiento o muere en una ducha de plomo
Rezo para que mi polla sea como la Torre Eiffel
Y así podré follarme el mundo durante setenta y dos horas

[Verso 1]
Mierda, me siento increíble, mierda me siento en Matrix
Mi mente está еn las nubes y esta 9 nunca está dе vacaciones
Arranco el Maserati y - vroom-vroom! - voy corriendo
Tomando píldoras en el lobby y rezando para que no la encuentren desnuda
Y rezando para que los negros estéis odiando, los tiradores van tras Judas
Jesucristo, si yo vivo arrodillado no hay necesidad de que haga esto
Aparco delante de Lueders, cerca de Church’s Chicken
Todos vosotros, cobardes, sois perdedores, todos mis negros son ganadores, gritando:

[Coro]
Toda la vida he querido dinero y poder
Respeta mi pensamiento o muere en una ducha de plomo
Rezo para que mi polla sea como la Torre Eiffel
Y así podré follarme el mundo durante setenta y dos horas
[Post-Coro 1]
Mierda, tengo perras, mierda, tengo perras
Mierda, tengo perras: mujer, novia y amante
Toda la vida he querido dinero y poder
Respeta mi pensamiento o muere en una ducha de plomo

[Verso 2]
Tengo veinticinco mecheros en mi tocador, señor
Fogeo ese culo, cuerpo escayolado en una camilla
Y ella tiene un culo que ni siquiera una regla puede medir
Y me hace correrme rápido, aunque eso nunca me avergüenza
Y reconozco que tú tienes lo que he estado queriendo desde aquel tema
Que Adina Howard sacó rápidamente para impresionarla
Ella enrolla uno, yo sostengo mi escroto mientras poso
La voz aquí es dorada, así que os jodan a todos, yo entro, y —

[Coro]
Toda la vida he querido dinero y poder
Respeta mi pensamiento o muere en una ducha de plomo
Rezo para que mi polla sea como la Torre Eiffel
Y así podré follarme el mundo durante setenta y dos notas

[Post-Coro 2]
Mierda, tengo perras, mierda, tengo perras
Mierda, tengo perras: mujer, novia y amante
Toda la vida he querido dinero y poder
Respeta mi pensamiento o, negro, es el momento
[Verso 3]
Enrollo en masa con un buen picador
Y corro hacia la puta con un testigo
Es una carrera de relevos con un ramo de flores
Ellas dicen: “K, te casarás conmigo.”
Perraaa! Jamás, perraaa! Jamás
Perraaa! Jamás. perraaa! Jamás
Nunca viviré confinado
Mientras te siento, aunque esté ciego
Puedo decirte quién, qué, cuándo, dónde
Cómo vendes tu juego en cada momento
Perraaa! Ve a jugar, perraaa! Ve a jugar
Perraaa! Ve a jugar, perraaa! Parezco OJ
Matando todo, desde coños hasta un jodido beat de Hit-Boy
Ella explota su coño y yo tengo opciones como un audible, yo soy
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, yo gano, y me río de tu derrota
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, mi ciudad, trapicheando en la calle, gritando —

[Coro]
Toda la vida he querido dinero y poder
Respeta mi pensamiento o muere en una ducha de plomo
Rezo para que mi polla sea como la Torre Eiffel
Y así podré follarme el mundo durante setenta y dos notas

Mierda, tengo perras, mierda, tengo perras

Hay cosas que no comprendo
A veces necesito estar solo

Mira dentro de mi alma y podrás encontrar oro y quizás te vuelvas rico
Mira dentro de tu alma y podrás descubrir que nunca existió
Puedo sentir los cambios
Puedo sentir una nueva vida, siempre supe que la vida puede ser peligrosa
Puedo decir que me gusta el reto y tú me dices que es indoloro
Tú no sabes lo que es el dolor
Cómo puedo pintar este cuadro
Cuando tú eres daltónico?
Cayó en mi cara y desperté con una cicatriz
Otro error viviendo profundo en mi corazón
Admito mis errores sin problema
Puedo admitir que se parecen a los que tú cometiste
Por qué estás resentido cada vez que lo hago?
Dime otra vez que tu objetivo es baladí
Pero hasta un pequeño mechero puede hacer arder un puente
Incluso un pequeño mechero puede hacer arder un puente

[Pre-Coro: Kendrick Lamar]
Puedo sentir los cambios
Puedo sentir que hay gente nueva alrededor de mí que solamente quieren ganar fama
Puedes ver que mi ciudad me descubrió
Y me puso sobre los escenarios, para mí eso es increíble
Para ti eso es sólo una prueba rápida
Con toda la falta de respeto déjame decir esto

Estoy intentando mantenerlo vivo
Sin comprometer los sentimientos que amamos
Tú estás intentando mantenerlo deficiente
Y solo firmando contratos con lo que hacen en las radios
Te estoy mirando más allá de ti
Vivimos en un mundo, vivimos en un mundo con dos ejes diferentes
Tú vives en un mundo, tú vives detrás del espejo
Conozco las cosas que te dan miedo
La sensación de sentir emociones inferiores
Esta mierda es vital, sé que tú tenías que
Esta mierda es vital, sé que tú tenías que
Morir en vano, hablarme sobre un reloj y una cadena
Es mucho más creíble, dame alguna ganancia factible
En lugar de un nombre estacional
Dejare que la gente sepa que es algo a lo que puedes echar la culpa
Sobre nosotros, y puedes permanecer encerrado en una caja
Yo escaparé y esconderé cada llave
Yo escaparé y esconderé cada llave

Están esperando a Kendrick, como en los días uno y quince
Tres dedos en el aire, puedo ver que estáis sincronizados
Esconde tus sentimientos, esconde tus sentimientos, es lo mejor que puedes hacer
Me llevaré a tu chica y pondré ese chocho sobre un pedestal

Ayy, K-Dot, entra en el coche, negro!
Venga, vamos a dar una vuelta
Negro, tengo una cajetilla de tabaco negro y un CD de beats
Vamos y te haces unos freestyles!

[Letra de "Kendrick Lamar - BLOOD. (Traducción al Español)"]

[Intro: Bēkon]
¿Es maldad?
¿Es debilidad?
Tú decides
¿Vamos a vivir o a morir?

[Verso: Kendrick Lamar]
Pues estaba dando una vuelta el otro día
Y vi a una mujer, una mujer ciega
Paseando por la acera
Se veía un poco frustrada
Como si se le hubiese caído algo y
Lo estuviese pasando mal buscándolo
Así que después de ver su problema por un momento
Decido ir a echarle una mano, sabes
"Hola, señora, ¿le puedo ayudarla en algo?
Me pareció ver que había perdido algo
Y me gustaría ayudarle a encontrarlo."
Me contestó: "Oh, sí, has perdido algo
Has perdido... tu vida."

[Disparo de arma]

[Puente: Bēkon]
¿Es maldad?
[Outro: Eric Bolling & Kimberly Guilfoyle]
Lamar dio su opinión acerca de la brutalidad policial
Con una línea de una canción que citamos:
"Y odiamos a los polis. Nos quieren matar por la calle, por supuesto"
Oh, por favor, agh, no me gusta[Intro: Bēkon]
È malvagità?
È debolezza?
Tu decidi
Vivremo o moriremo?

[Verso: Kendrick Lamar]
Stavo facendo una passeggiata l'altro giorno
E ho visto una signora—una donna cieca
Che camminava su e giù per il marciapiede
Sembrava un po' frustrata
Come se gli fosse caduto qualcosa e
Facesse difficoltà a trovarlo
Quindi dopo averla vista lottare un po'
Decido di andare da lei e darle una mano, sai?
"Salve signora, posso esserle d'aiuto?
Sembra che abbia perso qualcosa
Vorrei aiutarla a trovarla."
Lei rispose: "Oh si, hai perso qualcosa
Hai perso… la vita."

{Sparo}

[Bridge: Bēkon]
È malvagità?
[Outro: Eric Bolling & Kimberly Guilfoyle]
Lamar ha dichiarato le sue opinioni sulla brutalità della polizia
Con questa barra nella canzone, e cito:
"E odiamo la polizia, vogliono ucciderci nelle strade di sicuro'."
Oh per favore, ugh, Non mi piace[Letra de "Kendrick Lamar - DNA. (Traducción al Español)"]

[Verso 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tengo, tengo, tengo, tengo—
Lealtad, tengo realeza dentro de mi ADN
Un cuarto de cocaína, tengo guerra y paz dentro de mi ADN
Tengo poder, veneno, dolor y alegría en mi ADN
Tengo empuje, ambición, flow dentro de mi ADN
Nací así, desde siempre he sido así, inmaculada concepción
Transformo así, actúo así, era el arma nueva de Yeshua
No contemplo, yo medito, luego fuera de tu jodida cabeza
Esto que puso-los-niños-en-la-cama
Esto que yo tengo, tengo, tengo, tengo—
Realismo, yo solo mato mierda porque está en mi ADN
Tengo millones, tengo riquezas creciendo en mi ADN
Me puse oscuro, obtuve el mal, que se pudre en mi ADN
Me escapé, tuve problemas del corazón dentro de mi ADN
Simplemente vuelvo a ganar, luego vuelvo a ganar como en Wimbledon, yo sirvo
Sí, ése es él otra vez, el sonido del motor es como el de un pájaro
Ves fuegos artificiales y la rueda del Corvette haciendo skrrt en el boulevard
Sé como trabajas, sé exactamente quién eres
Mira, tú eres una, tú eres una, tú eres una—
Perra, tus hormonas probablemente se intercambian en tu ADN
El problema es, toda esa mierda dentro de tu ADN
Tu papi probablemente delató, herencia dentro de tu ADN
La columna vertebral no existe, nacido fuera de una medusa, calculo
Mira, mi linaje definitivamente no tolera la falsedad
La mierda por la que he pasado probablemente te ofenda, este es el hijo mayor de Paula
Conozco asesinato, condena, celulares desechables, contrabandistas, ladrones, mafiosos, muertos, redención, estudiosos, padres muertos con hijos y yo desearía ser dado el perdón
Sí, sí, sí, sí, ADN de soldado (ADN de soldado)
Nacido dentro de la bestia, mi experiencia comprobada en el segundo grado
Cuando tenía 9, en la celda, motel, no teníamos ningún lugar donde quedarnos
A los 29, lo he hecho tan bien, pegar la rueda del carro en mi propiedad
Y voy a brillar como se supone, antisocial extrovertido
Y la excelencia significa trabajo extra
Y la distracción qué carajo oíste
Y los pesimistas nunca me han puesto nervioso
Y eso es un riff, va a alegar su caso
La razón de que mi poder está aquí en la Tierra
Saludar la verdad, cuando el profeta dice
[Puente: Kendrick Lamar y Geraldo Rivera]
Tengo lealtad, tengo realeza dentro de mi ADN
Es por esto que digo que el hip hop ha hecho más daño a los jóvenes afroamericanos que el racismo en los últimos años
Tengo lealtad, tengo realeza dentro de mi ADN
Vivo una mejor vida, estoy tirando varios dados, que se joda tu vida
Tengo lealtad, tengo realeza dentro de mi ADN
Vivo una me-, que se joda tu vida
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Esta es mi herencia, todo lo que estoy heredando
Dinero y poder, el hacedor de matrimonios

[Verso 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Díganme algo
Ustedes hijos de puta no pueden decirme nada
Prefiero morir antes que escucharlos
Mi ADN no está para ser imitado
Tu ADN es una abominación
Así es como es cuando estas en la Matrix
Esquivando balas, cosechando lo que siembras
Y apilando el metraje, viviendo sobre la marcha
Y durmiendo en una villa
Bebiendo de un Grammy y caminando en el edificio
Diamante en el techo, mármol en el piso
Playa dentro de la ventana, mirando por la ventana
Bebé en la piscina, ambiciones de padrino
Sólo el Señor sabe que he estado dándole duro
Evadiendo paparazzis, enloqueciendo a través de las cámaras
Comer en Four Daughters, Brock usa sandalias
Yoga en un lunes, estirándose a Nirvana
Viendo todas las serpientes, rechazando a todos los falsos
El teléfono nunca encendido, yo no converso
Yo no comprometo, sólo penetro
Sexo, dinero, asesinato—estos son los cortes
Estos son los tiempos, nivel número 9
Mira arriba al cielo, 10 está en camino
Sentencia en camino, matanzas en camino
Hijo de puta, tengo ganadores en camino
Tú no eres una mierda sin un arma en tu cinturón
Tú no eres una mierda sin un boleto en tu plato
Tú no eres lo suficientemente bueno para hacerlo solo
Tú no eres lo suficientemente rico como para golpear el lote y patinar
Dime cuándo la destrucción va a ser mi destino
Va a ser tu destino, va a ser nuestra fe
Paz al mundo, déjalo rotar
Sexo, dinero, asesinato—nuestro ADN
[Outro del video]
ADN, ADN
Negro real en mi ADN
No hay ninguna puta en mi ADN

[Verse 1]
Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto—
Lealtà, ho lealtà nel mio DNA
Un quarto di cocaina, ho guerra e pace nel mio DNA
Ho ottenuto potere, veleno, dolore e gioia nel mio DNA
Ho ottenuto una spinta però, flow ambizioso nel mio DNA
Sono nato così, tipo uno così, immacolata concezione
Mi trasformo così, mi esibisco così, era la nuova arma di Yeshua
Io non contemplo, io medito, poi via tua fottuta testa
Questo che mette i bambini a letto
Questo che Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto, Ho ottenuto—
Realtà, Ho solo ucciso la merda dato che è nel mio DNA
Ho ottenuto milioni, Ho ottenuto ricchezze nel mio DNA
Mi sono oscurato, ho ottenuto il male, quel marcio nel mio DNA
Sono sceso, ho un cuore incasinato nel mio DNA
Ho solo vinto ancora, e vinco ancora tipo Wimbledon, Io servo
Si, è lui ancora, il suono che è in moto è tipo un uccello
Tu vedi fuochi d'artificio e gomme di Corvette sgommare nella strada
So come lavori, So solo chi sei
Vedi, sei una, sei una, sei una—
Puttana, i tuoi ormoni probabilmente cambiano dentro il mio DNA
Il problema è, tutti i succhia merda dentro il tuo DNA
Papà probabilmente ha fatto la spia, eredità dentro il tuo DNA
La spina dorsale non esiste, nato come una medusa, Valuto
Vedi, il mio pedigree sicuramente non tollera la merda
Che ho passato probabilmente ti ha offeso, questo è il figlio maggiore di Paula
Conosco assassini,convinti
Bruciatori, sostenitori, ladri, smidollati, morti, redenti
Scolari, padri morti con bambini e
Vorrei essere nutrito di perdono
Si, si, si, si, DNA del soldato (Ho il DNA di un soldato)
Nato dentro la bestia, la mia esperienza è stata testata in seconda elementare
Quando avevo 9 anni, al telefono, in un motel, non avevamo nessun posto dove stare
A 29 anni,Ho fatto così bene, fare la ruota nella mia villa
E brillerò come dovrei, estroverso antisociale
E eccellente significa il lavoro extra
E assenza che cazzo hai sentito
E i pessimisti non mi hanno mai colpito
E Nazareth chiederà il suo caso
Il motivo per cui il mio potere è qui sulla terra
Saluta la verità, quando dice il profeta

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
Ho-Ho ottenuto lealtà, ottenuto realtà nel mio DNA
Questa è il perché io dico che l'hip hop ha fatto molti più danni ai giovani afroamericani che il razzismo in questi anni
Ho ottenuto lealtà, ottenuto realtà nel mio DNA
Vivo una vita migliore, Sto lanciando diversi dadi,fanculo la tua vita
Ho ottenuto lealtà, ottenuto realtà nel mio DNA
Vivo una mi-, fanculo la tua vita
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Questa è la mia eredità, tutto ciò che sto ereditando
Soldi e potere, la mecca dei matrimoni

[Verse 2]
Dimmi qualcosa
Voi figli di puttana non potete dirmi niente
Preferirei morire che ascoltarti
Il mio DNA non è un imitazione
Il tuo DNA è un abominio
Ecco com'è quando sei in Matrix
Schivando proiettili, raccogliendo quello che semini
E montando il filmato, vivendo spostandosi
E dormendo in una villa
Sorseggiando da un Grammy, camminando nell'edificio
Diamante nel tetto, biglie per terra
Spiaggia dentro la villa, sbirciando fuori dalla finestra
Bimbo nella piscina, obiettivi da padrino
Solo il Signore sa che sono stato martellato
Schivando paparazzi, impazzendo davanti ai cameraman
Mangiando al Four Daughters, Brock indossa sandali
Yoga il Lunedì, stirandosi verso il Nirvana
Guardando tutti i serpenti, curvo tutti i falsi
Il telefono mai acceso, io non parlo
Io non comprometto, Io penetro solamente
Sesso, soldi,omicidio—queste sono le pause
Questi sono i tempi, livello numero 9
Guada su nel cielo,  il 10 sta arrivando
La sentenza sta arrivando, gli omicidi stanno arrivando
Figlio di puttana, Ho vincitori nella mia strada
Non sei una merda senza un corpo sulla cintura
Non sei una merda senza un biglietto sul piatto
Non sei abbastanza malato per tirartelo addosso
Ynon sei abbastanza ricco per colpire il sacco e pattinare
Ditemi quando la distruzione sarà il mio fato
Sarò il tuo fato, sarà il nostro fato
Pace al mondo, lasciatelo ruotare
Sesso, soldi, omicidi—il nostro DNA

Reubicar, saltar en el mismo G5

Ellos nunca estuvieron listos sí, yo sé sí, lo sé sí

Ninguno de ustedes logrando ese flujo sí, ese flujo sí
Años en la fabricación, no todos lo confunden
Los tengo por un derrumbe, estamos hablando de carreras
Usted sabe que esto nunca será una corbata, apenas mira los cordones
Sabes que las carreras despegan, solo tienes que ser paciente
Señor uno a cinco, esa es la única lógica
Falsificar mi muerte, ir a Cuba, esa es la única opción

La próxima vez que lleguen a la autopista 10, necesitamos recibo, ¿eh?
Porque la mayoría de ustedes no son reales
La mayoría de ustedes gritaron
La mayoría de ustedes sólo son envidia, los celos te matan
La mayoría de ustedes lanzan piedras y tratan de ocultar su mano
Simplemente di su nombre y te prometo que verás a Candyman
Porque todo está en tus ojos
La mayoría de ustedes dicen mentiras
La mayoría de ustedes no se desvanecen
La mayoría de ustedes han sido advertidos
En mi Último LP traté de levantar a los artistas negros
Pero es una diferencia entre los artistas negros y los artistas sin talento

Me siento como un chip en mis hombros
Me siento como que estoy perdiendo mi enfoque
Me siento como que estoy perdiendo mi paciencia
Me siento como mis pensamientos en el sótano
Me siento, siento que estás mal educado
Siento que no quiero que me molesten
Siento que tú puedes ser el problema
Siento que no es mañana, a la mierda el mundo
El mundo se está acabando, he terminado de fingir
Y vete a la mierda si te ofendes
Me siento como amigos sobrevalorados
Me siento que la familia que ha estado fingiendo
Siento que los sentimientos están cambiando
Siento que mi pensamiento de compromiso está cansado
Siento que quieres averiguar cómo lo hice
Siento que no los estoy sintiendo a todos
Tengo ganas de retirarme, sin sentimientos involucrados
Lo siento por ti, he estado en el campo por ti
Es real para ti, ¿verdad? Mierda, me siento como—

Siento negros fuera de bolsillo

Soy leyenda, siento que todos ustedes son campesinos
Siento que todos ustedes están desesperados
Siento que todo lo que se necesita es un segundo para sentirse igual
Mike Jordan cada vez que sostiene un micrófono real
No siento tu presencia
Siento que te estoy aprendiendo una lección
Siento solo yo y la música aunque
Siento que tu sentimiento no es mutuo
Siento como el enemigo que debes saber
Siente como el sentimiento de no esperanza
El sentimiento de mala droga
Un cuarto de onza manipulada de jabón
El sentimiento, el sentimiento de la libertad falsa
Les daré de comer el veneno que los llena en la prisión
Siento que soy solo yo
Mira, siento que no puedo respirar
Mira, siento que no puedo dormir
Mira, me siento sin corazón, a menudo fuera de esto
El sentimiento de caer, de desmoronarse con
Las horas más oscuras, lo perdí
Llenando el vacío de ser empleado con dinero
Las calles están hablando, llena los espacios en blanco con ataúdes
Llena los bancos con dólares
Llena las tumbas con padres
Llena a los bebés con mierda
Blogs de internet y púlpito, rellenalos con chismes
Siento que esto tiene que ser el sentimiento donde estaba 'Pac
El sentimiento de un apocalipsis sucediendo
Pero nada es incómodo, el sentimiento no prosperará
El sentimiento es tóxico, siento que estoy boxeando demonios
Monstruos, falsos profetas intrigantes
Patrocinadores, promesas de la industria
Negros, perras, blancos, hackers, Compton
Iglesia, religión, "negros que crean diversidad en medios" en esclavitud
Visitas judiciales, citación servida en concierto
A la mierda tus sentimientos, lo digo por impostores
Puedo sentirlo, el fénix seguro de mirarnos
Puedo sentirlo, el sueño es más que un proceso
Puedo poner un régimen que forma el Lago Ness
Puedo sentirlo, el grito que atormenta nuestra lógica
Tengo ganas de decir algo, tengo ganas de tomar algo
Tengo ganas de patinar, tengo ganas de esperarlos
Tal vez sea demasiado tarde para ellos
Siento que todo el mundo quiere que ore por ellos
¿Pero quién carajo reza por mí?
[Outro]
No hay nadie rezando por mí
¿Quién reza por mí?
No hay nadie rezando[Produzido por Terrace Martin]

[Introdução: Darlene Tibbs]
Vai se foder, filho da puta, tu é um preto mariquinha
Não sei por que tu tá tentando crescer, preto, tu não é ninguém
Andando por aí como se fosse o presente de Deus à terra, preto, tu não é ninguém
Tu nem comprou um vestido bonito pra mim
Eu preciso de um grande e grosso pau brasileiro de 50 centímetros, tu é perda de tempo
Eu nem devia tá dando pra ti
Eu preciso de um preto rico e magnata
Tu é um preto liso e todo mundo sabe disso
Teus manos sabem, todo mundo sabe, porra
Vai se foder, preto, não me liga mais
Você nem vai saber, vai perder uma mina boa
Meu outro preto já é, tu já era
Que porra é essa mermão?

[Verso: Kendrick Lamar]
Esse pau não é grátis!
Tu olha pra mim como se eu não fosse um recibo
Como se eu nunca tivesse dado um jeito
E comesse seus restos e carne crua
Esse pau não é grátis!
Viver em cativeiro aumentou meu salário
Me dizendo que verde é tudo que eu preciso
Sendo que tudo que eu vi foi carne de lata e sardinha
Esse pau não é grátis, tipo, amor
Você realmente achou que a gente teria um filho chamado Mercedes
Sem uma Mercedes Benz e um aro 24 polegadas
Tinta 5% e saída de ar condicionado?
Mas nem fodendo! Esse pau não é grátis!
Eu preciso de quarenta acres e uma mula
Não de quarenta gramas e um pitbull
Besteira, abatedouro, abatedouro
Alguém bateu na porta, deixe entrar, quem é?
O melhor amigo da genitália -- esse pau não é grátis
Sinta pena do tolo que fez a beleza em você prosperar
Tetas grandes e lábios de buceta me mantiveram detestável
Me mantiveram vendo pornô na pobreza; desculpas? Não
Assisto você politizar com pessoas menos sortudas, como eu
Todo cão tem seu dia, agora ficar de quatro deve ajudar
Esse pau não é grátis!
Aliás, ele precisa de interesse
Aliás, ele tem 18 centímetros
Aliás, nossa amizade é apenas negócios
Pensão e mais pensão, você está beliscando meu dinheiro
Tem sido implacável, foda-se perdão, fodam-se seus sentimentos
Fodam-se suas fontes, toda distorção, se você foder, é mais abortos
Mais tribunais de divórcio e separação
Meu cheque com menos endosso me deixou dormente
Empoeirado, condenado, enojado, forçado
Que merda ainda tá faltando?
A pressão estoura os canos de porcelana duas vezes
A escolha está devastada, decapitado está o cavaleiro
Ó América, sua puta má, eu catei algodão e te deixei rica
E agora meu pau não é grátis!
[Saída]
Vou fazer meu Tio Sam calar tua boca
Tu não é rei nenhum

[Verse 1]
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind

Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so it make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide, behind the fucking cameras

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all

It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that Math, dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'mma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate, my dreams, get it right
Get a life, I got 2, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back

[Bridge]
I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you

Put them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower
And the power in the people and if they don't believe us, they'll die

[Tekst - tłumaczenie - Rap Genius Polska]



On the dull gray door to Studio 2 of the L.A. soundlab where Top Dawg Entertainment makes the magic happen, two warnings are posted


The first one, printed on TDE letterhead and titled “Studio Rules, Bitch!!” reads like ScHoolboy Q wrote it, mostly because rule No. 3 is “Don’t touch, ask, or reach for Q’s weed.” The second sheet, also on TDE letterhead, is more serious. At the top, in black capital letters, it reads: “IF YOU NOT THE HOMIE, DON’T COME IN HERE.” At the bottom, in red letters: “DISREGARD THIS AND GET THE TIPS PUT ON YOU, HOMIE.”

The reason for the caution: On any given day, Kendrick Lamar might be in deep concentration working on the follow-up to his 2012 major label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city. GKMC was more than a great album; it was a landmark event, a modern masterpiece to rival Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle. It’s an artistically ambitious, highly personal piece of work: a day in the young artist’s life, encompassing gang culture in his Compton hometown, alcohol, drugs, life, death, God, family, and the pursuit of a girl named Sherane, a “concept album” that managed to sell over 1.2 million copies while making zero creative concessions. It transformed Kendrick from an Internet sensation into an A-list rap star

The success of GKMC in 2012, along with Ab-Soul’s Control System and ScHoolboy Q’s Habits & Contradictions, made TDE—launched in 1997 out of Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith’s home studio in Carson, Calif.—the hottest new rap label around. With TDE, Odd Future, YG, DJ Mustard, Nipsey Hussle, and others all popping, L.A. has been reestablished as a vibrant rap city. The renaissance shows no signs of slowing this year, with acclaimed releases like YG’s My Krazy Life, ScHoolboy Q’s Oxymoron, and Ab-Soul’s These Days.... Still, GKMC remains the crowning achievement

“When I went back to my old high school, all these kids looking at me like I’m the real big homie, the same way I look at Jay Z, Nas, or Dr. Dre,” says Kendrick with a laugh, sitting in his luxury trailer at his Complex cover shoot. “You would’ve thought Michael Jackson walked through that joint off the excitement that they had.”

But now that Kendrick, 27, is a hysteria-inducing star, the world is waiting to see if he can deliver twice. Expectations are high. After good kid, good simply won’t be good enough. Unlike GKMC, which Kendrick planned years in advance, there’s no cover art in mind for the follow-up. As for a title, Kendrick says he’s “flirting with ideas.” He’s been working primarily with TDE’s in-house producers, Tae Beast and Sounwave of Digi+Phonics, but has also gotten in the studio with Dr. Dre. He’s still just “getting his ideas down,” but so far Kendrick’s recorded 30 to 40 new songs for the album (he recorded 60 to 70 songs for GKMC). He says he’ll be ready for a fourth quarter release

“Good kid set the bar,” says Terrence “Punch” Henderson, president of TDE and the crew’s resident rap history buff. “Today, that’s the album that you gotta compare your album to. Illmatic would be the comparison—it didn’t sell the most records, but that was the standard.”

It’s the cornerstone of Nas’ legacy, but Illmatic was both a gift and a curse. Critics and fans alike compare all of Nas’ subsequent albums to his 1994 debut and are never quite satisfied. Ditto for Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, DMX, Slick Rick, and other rap greats who burst out of the gate with classic albums. Although other legends—including Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Kendrick’s Interscope labelmate Eminem—delivered strong second albums that arguably surpassed their first efforts, creating a worthy follow-up is one of rap’s greatest challenges

“Kendrick shook up the rap game, so anticipation for his second offering is through the roof,” says Nas. “Kendrick’s an album guy and the album artist has a whole different kind of value. Kendrick is going to be one of the most important writers of our time; dude’s a rhyming animal. Whatever he does will be appreciated, but at the same time he knows he has to bring it.”

Kendrick says there’s less pressure on him now than there was right before good kid came out, when he was admittedly “super nervous.” “I was on the tour bus going back and forth on the text with Pharrell,” says Kendrick. “I asked him, ‘You think they gon’ get it?’ And he told me, ‘Don’t ever doubt yourself again. Always be aware but don’t ever mistake your first mind, your input of where your heart is at.’”

Today Kendrick trusts that his creative process will lead him where he needs to go. “If I keep focusing on, ‘I need to make something better than good kid,’ it’s going to be just that,” says Kendrick. “That’s not challenging yourself. I don’t want to become that person reflecting on what has been done. What I’m doing now is the question. I’m only as good as my last word, my last hook, my last bridge.”
To fully appreciate the impact of GKMC, consider the context it was released in. Of the 10 biggest rap hits of 2012, two were by Flo Rida, two featured Nicki Minaj rapping over EDM-style production (including “Starships”), and one was “Gangnam Style.” For better or worse, Kendrick’s Interscope labelmate Chief Keef had become a scapegoat for a perceived decline in rap lyrics and the fetishizing of ghetto violence by the media. Weeks before GKMC dropped, rap news was dominated by fights between G-Unit and MMG’s camps at the BET Awards

Once GKMC sold 242,122 copies its first week, became the best reviewed rap album on Metacritic since Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and discussions about the classic status of the album hit a fevered pitch, Kendrick morphed from a promising rapper to the face of “real hip-hop.” Not just because of his artistic achievement, but because his celebrity relied solely on his musical output—not beef, fashion choices, business ventures, or the other gimmicks that have seemingly become part of the standard package for nearly every rapper

After the album’s release, Kendrick’s life was a whirlwind of tour dates and unexpected controversies. He toured non-stop in 2013, playing college campuses, festivals, opening for Kanye West on the Yeezus tour, and going on the good kid, m.A.A.d city world tour. During his tour, as he traveled from Sweden to Belgium with little Internet connection, Kendrick Lamar unintentionally set the rap world on fire
On the night of August 12, 2013, Big Sean released the Kendrick Lamar and Jay Electronica–assisted “Control”—a song meant for Sean’s album, Hall of Fame, but left off due to sample clearance issues. On Lamar’s earth-shattering verse he called himself the King of New York, a claim he shies away from now: “I feel B.I.G. and Jay will always be the King of New York.” More important, Lamar called out nearly every rapper in his generation—from A$AP Rocky to J. Cole and even Big Sean and Jay Electronica—and claimed, “I got love for you all but I’m tryna murder you niggas.”

By the next day, “Control” had taken on a life of its own. Instagram was overrun with “Control” memes, storm clouds of rap debates gathered, and thinkpieces poured out—even legendary NBA coach Phil Jackson, who was mentioned in the verse, got in the mix, tweeting at Kendrick. Just about every rapper, whether they were mentioned in the song or not, commented on the verse or dropped a response track. TMZ ran up on any rapper they could find, trying to goad them into responding. The week of the song’s release, Kendrick picked up 208,000 new Twitter followers

Rappers are supposed to want to best each other—“I’m better than him” sums up rap’s competitive mantra. But “Control” proved something contemporary philosopher Slavoj Žižek once argued about Wikileaks, what he calls “the paradox of public space”: “Even if everyone knows an unpleasant fact, saying it in public changes everything.” By naming names, Kendrick’s verse was the moment he asserted his dominance in rap. Earlier that year MTV had named Lamar the Hottest MC and Complex declared him the Best Rapper Alive; “Control” was when Lamar’s status as the best coalesced
I'm only as good as my last word, my last hook, my last bridge.One rapper Kendrick didn’t mention in his “Control” verse was Macklemore. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Macklemore’s The Heist beat Kendrick’s GKMC for Best Rap Album. Although Kendrick was nominated for seven awards, he went home empty handed, while Macklemore won Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap Performance. For fans on Twitter and members of the media (including Complex), Macklemore’s wins and Kendrick’s snubs served as a watershed moment for cultural appropriation in rap. To make matters worse, Macklemore Instagramed an apologetic text he sent to Kendrick after the awards that read, “I robbed you.”

“It wasn’t really a huge deal for me,” says Kendrick, who’s known Macklemore for over a year. “Macklemore deserves the accolades. That’s still my partner regardless. He probably didn’t need to Instagram the text. But what’s done is done.”

Like Macklemore’s success, Kendrick’s comes after years on the independent grind. In 2003, when he was 16, Kendrick dropped his first mixtape under the moniker K-Dot. He released three more mixtapes before reverting to his government name (omitting his last name, Duckworth) and dropping the Kendrick Lamar EP in 2009. Over the next two years, with his mixtape Overly Dedicated and his independently released first album, Section.80, he found the voice that made GKMC a classic. But Kendrick’s acuity with words predates his musical output
“My first-grade teacher flipped out because I wrote the word ‘audacity’ in a story,” he recalls. “I knew the word only because I heard my auntie and uncles arguing, saying, ‘You got the audacity to take my motherfucking drink and pour it out?!’ I learned all my words like that, so when I went to school it was in my head.”

Kendrick’s perspective on life always comes back to his Compton roots. His upbringing provides him with a treasure trove of traumatic experiences that give his music a sense of purpose. On the lyrical blackout “m.A.A.d city,” he describes seeing a “light-skin nigga with his brains blown out.” Around age 5, he witnessed his uncle’s murder. In conversation, he casually recalls yet another murder, when he called his friend Yo to the barbershop just before someone shot up the block, killing one of their homeboys

GKMC apparently only scratched the surface of the stories Kendrick has to tell. “There were so many things I thought he was gonna talk about in good kid that he didn’t,” says Kendrick’s manager Dave Free, who remembers the days when K-Dot couldn’t be spotted with a backpack, lest he be labeled a conscious rapper. “All these other stories, shit that will blow your brain, have never been heard before because they’re just too personal. There’s still so much to be said. The question is, is he gonna say it?”

Whether or not Kendrick tells those stories could go a long way toward determining if he’ll be able to top his major label debut. “I got a greater purpose,” he says. “God put something in my heart to get across and that’s what I’m going to focus on, using my voice as an instrument and doing what needs to be done.” The only place to do that is back in the studio
For a few hours, Kendrick can forget about his next album. He’s back in Studio 2 working on a guest verse for Jay Rock’s upcoming album. According to Dave, a typical Kendrick guest verse costs $250,000. They once charged $400,000. He’s had some of his best moments on other people’s songs: trading bars with Eminem on “Love Game,” introducing an R&B flow on Robin Thicke’s “Give It 2 U,” stealing the show on A$AP Rocky’s star-studded “Fuckin’ Problems”—a song originally made for GKMC but given away because it didn’t fit the narrative arc of the album

Kendrick gets to the studio at 3 p.m. and sits on a black couch in the lounge area playing Jay Rock tracks on his MacBook. He sports a navy blue Detroit Tigers hat, white T, gray sweats, and, for the third day in a row, a pair of blue Nike Roshe Runs with white polka dots. A gold and black painting of Snoop Dogg, with the lyrics to “Murder Was the Case” inscribed in cursive, hangs behind him. He turns the TV to an episode of South Park but keeps the volume down and doesn’t even glance at the screen. Eyes fixed upon his computer, he listens to the music with his elbows on his thighs and his fingers interlocked. He rarely blinks
After about 15 minutes in the lounge, he moves into the studio and connects his laptop to the speakers, playing Jay Rock’s verse over and over, flipping around tracks, and sipping from a bottle of water. Later he’ll chomp on an order of volcano salmon sushi. He tends to eat healthy—salads, baked chicken, lots of water. He plays basketball twice a week because, as Jay Z once said, rapping is “like an exercise.” And unlike many rappers—including his TDE labelmates ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul—he rarely drinks and doesn’t smoke or sip lean. All the homies know not to bother him when he’s busy in the lab. Sometimes he kicks everyone out of the studio so he can play instrumentals all night long, alone. He’s been known to cut off his phone for months at a time
God put something in my heart to get across and that's what I'm going to focus onPunch describes Kendrick as a “mad scientist” in the studio, but watching him at work, nothing seems erratic. If anything, he’s supremely calculating; the song slowly builds as his process unfolds. Kendrick stands around mumble-rapping to himself with his right index finger extended, like he’s pointing out each syllable as if it passes by on an imaginary teleprompter. He scribbles his verse on a small notepad that sits above a mic compressor. After about an hour, his verse is written. He takes a break, checks his email, and chats in the studio a bit before grabbing a studio engineer and getting to work. The engineer dims the lights and starts looping up the beat. Kendrick hums the verse to himself a few more times before he’s ready to rock. Then he heads around the corner to the booth
In the booth, Kendrick is a case study in precision. He raps with his eyes closed and his hands out as if he’s casting a spell, rapping about “restricted territories” and “Percocet headaches.” On the first few takes, his voice sounds closer to his normal speaking voice than his agitated extraterrestrial rapping voice. He’s rhyming slower than usual, taking his time to enunciate each line. After about five takes, he steps out of the booth and returns to the pad and paper he left on the compressor. He edits the verse on paper, scratching out some lines and writing new ones. But when he goes back to the booth, he leaves the paper behind
“In the past, he never wrote down anything,” explains Sounwave, who produced “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe.” “Every now and then he’ll write down stuff, just for insurance purposes. He rehearses the song over and over in his head so he can get the full feeling.”

Kendrick returns to the booth and slams the door shut. He does a couple more takes but keeps flubbing one line halfway through the verse. He steps back and paces around the booth, repeating the lines over and over as he internalizes the verse’s structure. Then he looks up and says, “All right, let’s get it.” That’s when Derek “MixedByAli” Ali, Kendrick’s regular engineer, walks in and takes over

“Watching Kendrick is like watching a master chess player playing five games at one time,” says Ali. “He can do five songs in one day. He’ll start one song, then he’ll be like, ‘I’ma start on this.’ ‘I’ma go back to the old song.’ ‘I’ma start on this.’ There’s just so much going on in his head.”
When I'm in the studio I'm looking for a feeling I haven't felt. It's a high.Back in the booth, Kendrick is close to his 10th take. He hasn’t perfected it yet—some takes have better cadence, others have better breath control. He repeats the process over and over to pinpoint exactly what he wants. “Keep that one,” he tells Ali, “I’ma do one more.” After about a dozen takes, his voice opens up and his words start to crackle. He blurts the word “bitch” into the mic with the spontaneity and violence of a sneeze

“It’s not like, ‘Watch me get it in one take,’” says Sounwave. “It’s like, ‘Watch me get the best take.’ Sometimes we have a song complete and he’s like, ‘Nah, my tone on that.... Redo the whole thing.’ He redoes it and it’s like a different song now just because of the tone that he switched up.”

After 30 minutes and 15 takes, Kendrick proclaims that the mic is “hot,” ready to catch his voice perfectly. Having used a light mix for reference initially while he figured out his vision, he asks Ali to give him a live mix, which sounds closer to the completed version, in his headphones
Kendrick’s idea of what this verse should be is coming to fruition. Each take is sharper. He’s getting more animated in the booth, his head jerking as he screeches past each word. After about the 20th take, he’s satisfied enough to hop out of the booth to review. He keeps editing the paper but casually remarks that he’s done. It’s 5 p.m. and he’s on to the next

Like the human distractions Kendrick keeps out with a sign on the studio door, he doesn’t let fear enter his creative space. “This is truly a blessing from a higher power,” Kendrick says, “and as long as I understand that there’s really no limitations to what I can do. Everything is forward with me. When I’m in the studio I’m looking for creativity I haven’t matched yet, a feeling I haven’t felt. It’s a high. When you look at people like Jay Z, Nas, Dr. Dre, these people are established, but they love music and they love that high. You always want that feeling of creativity.” And with that, Kendrick Lamar politely excuses himself. He’s got work to do

Vou mandar uma ideia...
Não quero macacos filhos da puta que nem vocês
Sentando no meu trono de novo
"Ei ei, mano, qual a boa?"
"K-Dot voltou pra quebrada, mano!"
Tô bolado (Tá bolado!), mas tô de boa
Amigos de verdade, uma pergunta:

[Coro 1: Kendrick Lamar]

Você tem esse cheirinho? (Que cheirinho?)

[Verso 1: Kendrick Lamar]
O cheirinho de liderança
Vocês conseguem sentir quando eu ando na rua
(Conseguimos sim, conseguimos sim)
Eu até curto rap, mas um rapper com escritor fantasma?
Que porra é essa? (Essa não!)
Eu jurei que não ia falar, mas maioria de vocês compartilham barras
Como se estivessem presos numa cela de prisão (Uma cela de prisão)
Tem coisa errada aí (Tem coisa errada aí)
E se eu tiver que beijar um pé por grana
Eu prefiro ser um mendigo e viver na lama (Pode crer!)

[Verso 2: Kendrick Lamar]
O cheirinho trazido pelo Richard Pryor
Manipulou Bill Clinton com desejos
Vinte quatro horas por dia, sete dias por semana vezes dois
Eu refletia quando saía do palco
"Vou voltar pra quebrada, ver os inimigos e gritar bem alto..." (Pode crer)

[Verso 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Seu cabra filho da puta...
Eu ia matar alguns rappers, mas eles fizeram isso por mim
Eles são suicidas, nem precisam pedir ajuda pra mim
Essa porra é elementar, eu provavelmente vou ser preso
Se eu matar sua identidade e sair ileso
Finquei uma bandeira na minha cidade, todo mundo gritando 'Compton!'
Pra ser sincero, eu devia me candidatar a prefeito quando isso acabar
E eu juro pela minha mãe e minha filhinha também
Vinte milhões vão sair do tribunal gritando 'amém!'
Pode pá, pau no cu do juiz
Eu passei dos vinte cinco e fiquei feliz
Um neguinho cabeçudo com o mundo detrás dele
A vida não é nada além de uma vagina gorda
Gritando, "Annie, você está bem? Annie, você está bem?"
Limusine pintada com placas de ouro
Direto do fundo, essa é a barriga da besta
De um camponês, para um príncipe, para a porra de um rei (Pode crer)

[Coro 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Carai, onde vocês tavam quando eu caminhei? *Tiros*
"Quando você ouvir o próximo tiro
A fumaça vai estar dentro de ti" *Tiro*

Fiz o mundo inteiro falar e agora virei rei
Rei Kunta, todo mundo quer cortar as pernas dele

[Poema: Kendrick Lamar]
"Eu lembro que você estava conflituado, usando sua influência da forma errada"



My love for music, my passion for it, you know that's my life, you know? It's not just a job for me, it's truly a lifestyle. I wake up, I think about or a verse, I go to sleep I'm thinking about it. I walk out, throughout my day, you know I think about music.

[Control instrumental plays]

During the Revolt interview, Lamar was also talked about the important role that music plays in his life today.

It's just something I breathe now, I didn't always breathe it. I always was a fan of it, but now I really live it. That's inspiration within itself.

We'll be going into the middle of December, which is a blessing, a lot of people don't get the opportunity to be on a major stage in front of that many people and be able to learn. I'm just taking it all in stride and being a student of the game because Kanye [West], he's a great performer. I'm not too shabby, like I said, again, but I'm just there really to challenge myself, grow myself and take that next level.

During the brief interview, Lamar was also asked about what his next steps are.

Really getting back in that studio, locking in. Just keep continue with music, continue challenging myself. I don't really got much goin' on outside of music. So, that's about it.

Every member of rap's Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013—Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem—but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latest—and possibly greatest—rapper to come straight outta Compton.


We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.

It turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his "little bro"—a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.

So today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. "It all happened when I was overseas," he says. "I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed."

It's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds—one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever—and since then his legend has spread fast.

It actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album—about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing "that crazy-ass girl Sherane"—is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest—the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house—and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast—Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness—but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:
If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song "Control"—a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself "the king of New York," which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.

"Control" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.

Kendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it "back to the set" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. "It can be complicated and confusing," Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. "From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous—I still live in this world." And when someone back home needs something, "I still gotta get that phone call."

It's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.

A bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: "When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow." Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: "Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy."


On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over "Control" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on "Control," and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of "Hold On, We're Going Home," Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. "You watch," he joked, "I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!"

I asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. "Pretty cool." Shrugs. "And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't."

A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the "Control" thing: "You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'—pretending like nothing ever happened." Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped "Control" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.

I got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out—"Control" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. "Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis," Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, "No—peer. If anything. We all peers."


When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.

"I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now—it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette."

The visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. "It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin'," he explains. "I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle."

Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos—some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton—and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. "When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets—nobody never really knows," he says. "But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman."

A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, "Aw, man, I can't go to no club."

Kendrick spoke up.

"We have to go."

"Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go."

"You know me," Kendrick explained. "I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!"

Twenty minutes later, Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. "You guys seem so calm," I said.

"Well," Tiffith told me, "we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand."
The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati—Jay, Bey—mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the "King of New York" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. "It was all love at that party," he told me on the private jet.

After we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: "We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas."

By the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for "Swimming Pools (Drank)," a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency—Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK—a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.

It's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. "I don't know," he says. "It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be."

At one point on good kid Kendrick raps, "I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.

Kendrick Lamar might actually agree with SPIN's Brandon Soderberg that his flame-stoking "Control" verse is not as impressive as it seems. After declaring himself "King of New York," the Prince of Compton retreated to a land of gonzo Robin Thicke videos, Miley-fied MTV VMA performances, and unlimited BET awards nominations, while his peers (and followers) lobbed response after response after response after response after, um, Hitler parody video.

But at long, last Lamar himself has issued a response, which more or less amounts to: "Y'all trippin'." In an interview with Peter Rosenberg of New York's Hot 97, the Black Hippy was asked what he thought about all of the excitement surrounding his Big Sean cameo. "[It] was just a feature verse," he humble-bragged before revealing that it took him a few days to notice the hubub, since he'd been hanging out in the U.K. and all. He'd just wanted to "rap some bars."

The 20-minute chat can be heard below — hit play on the YouTube rip below to hear Lamar's thoughts on bicoastal rivalries, dangerous Twitter friends, and the business of elevating rap — but another gem emerged via a mere snippet of his forthcoming talk with Los Angeles radio's Power 106. Regarding his self-coronation, the West Coast MC let out a kingly scoff, lamented that he's been misunderstood, and let slip that he's been conferring with other rap royals.

"I think that's a case of, yeah, maybe I have to dumb down my lyrics just a little bit," said Lamar. "The irony of that line is the people that actually understood it and got it was the actual kings of New York — we’ve been sitting down with them this past week — and them understanding that it’s not about actually being the king of whatever coast, it’s about leaving a mark as great as Biggie, as great as Pac.” The entire Power 106 conversation airs Friday morning.Kendrick Lamar might actually agree with SPIN's Brandon Soderberg that his flame-stoking "Control" verse is not as impressive as it seems.

Oh Señor, acudo ante ti como un pecador
Y me arrepiento humildemente de mis pecados
Creo que Jesús es el Señor
Creo que Tú le devolviste de la muerte
Pido que Jesús venga a mi vida
Y sea mi Señor y Salvador
Acepto que Jesús tome control de mi vida
Y que yo viva para él a partir de hoy
Gracias, Señor Jesús, por salvarme con tu preciada sangre
En el nombre de Jesús, amen

[Verso]
La conocí en esta fiesta en El Segundo and Central
Tenía las aptitudes de las strippers de Atlanta
Su culo era como una joroba, desde el principio ella era un camello
Quiero montarla como los Árabes, en un Mercedes-Benz del 2004
“Hola, me llamo Kendrick”, ella dijo: “No, eres guapo”
Me susurró al oído, desapareció, entonces la encontré bailando
Sonaba Ciara de fondo
La música de festival que había nos hacía llevar gafas de sol, cool
“Dónde vives?” Dijo ella, “Al final de la calle del Instituto Dominguez”
Ok, sé que ese es el límite entre Compton y Paramount
“Bien, eso es Compton?” “No”, ella contestó
Entonces comencé a flirtear con ella
Yo quería sus muslos alrededor de mí
Diecisiete y solamente podía pensar en coños
Mi motivación era bastante inmoral: “Qué estás intentando hacer?”
Ella no contestó, simplemente me dio su Nextel
Dejó caer su número, hablamos durante todo el verano, bien
El verano pasó, y ahora me está gustando
Las conversaciones que tuvimos probablemente le sedujeron
Quien lo hubiera imaginado? Quizás mis acciones harán que termine casándome con ella
Amor o lujuria, no importa,  porque la vida mala está en nuestro ADN
Es profundo, la música de ser jóvenes y bobos
Nunca está silenciada, de hecho, está a mucho más volumen en el lugar de donde soy
Sabemos mucho el uno sobre el otro, su madre era una adicta al crack
Ella vive con su abuela y sus dos hermanos más jóvenes
Su primo favorito, Demetrius, es irrepetible
Su historial familiar pandillero me hacía sentir escéptico
Aunque no lo suficiente como para que deje de estar cachondo
“Quiero correrme, qué tal?”
Es lo que le dije tan pronto como el el episodio
De Martin termina, estoy intentando calentarme
Estaba tan caliente como un cactus
Mis tácticas de estar sediento puede que me hieran
Pero a la mierda, tenía corazón
Cogí las llaves de mi madre, me subí al coche, entonces, oh chico
Así que ahora voy por Rosecrans en un monovolumen
Atravesando Alameda, el depósito necesita ser rellenado
Tengo lo suficiente para pasar el atasco
Al menos eso espero, porque mis bolsillos están rotos como una promesa
Estoy pensando en follar
Pensando en sus muslos o quizás besando su cuello o quizás cuál será la siguiente posición
Ella me envía una foto de sus tetas, volviendo locos mis pensamientos
La miro, y casi me choco contra un Corvette
Entusiasmado por el roce con una mujer, ella es una masajista
Y yo soy una estrella del porno profesional intoxicado
Tengo uno de cincuenta en el maletero como Curtis Jackson para un rescate
Espero que ella esté suelta como un himno de Uncle Luke
Estoy a dos bloques de distancia, doscientos cincuenta pies
Y a seis pasos de donde ella está, me está saludando al otro lado de la calle
Me detengo, una sonrisa en mi cara, y entonces lo veo
Dos negros, dos sudaderas negras, me congelo y mi móvil comienza a sonar

[Outro]
Por favor, deja tu mensaje para el tres-dos-tres
Graba tu mensaje después del pitido
Kendrick, dónde estás?
Mierda, estoy aquí sentado esperando mi van
Me dijiste que ibas a estar de vuelta en quince minutos
Tengo que ir al ayuntamiento, los niños están listos para comer
Yo estoy lista para comer, mierda
Tengo que conseguir las cartillas de comida, vamos
Estás de camino o qué?
Espero que no estés por ahí con esos malditos chicos callejeros, mierda
Especialmente esa pequeña perra Sherane
A parte, que tú mañana tienes escuela
Si sigues estando todo el día por la calle, no pasarás al siguiente curso
Al undécimo curso
(Está Kendrick al otro lado del teléfono?)
Tu padre dice algo sobre esos malditos dominós (Déjame gritarle a mí)
Quieres echarte la bronca también, vamos Kenny, venga
Hola? Mierda, dónde están mis jodidas fichas de dominó?
(Kenny), Qué?
Estoy en este mensaje de voz, mierda (Oh), mierda
Dónde están mis jodidos dominos?
Es la segunda vez que te pido que traigas mis jodidas fichas de dominó
Pásame el jodido teléfono, mierda, no cuelgues, déjame
Kendrick, cuando recibas este mensaje, chico, llámame (Sigue perdiendo mis jodidas fichas e iremos al patio trasero)
Necesito saber cuándo vas a traer el maldito coche
Este hombre quejándose sobre las malditas fichas de dominó
No es tan serio, mierda, los jodidos dominós
Mierda, no voy a llegar a mi maldita cita, joder
Que le jodan a los malditos dominós, nadie quiere oír eso
Nadie quiere oír tu culo
De hecho, vuelve a poner mis temas oldies
Estas destrozando mi jodida vibra[Produced by Terrace Martin]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
24/7, 365, motherfucker I'm still right on time
Oh you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horses mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you my Plan B is to win your hearts before we win a Grammy
These Days ain't shit changed, different toilet, same shit
And I drank a whole gallon of laxatives by accident
Just to shit on you has-beens
Had it been for my past tense, I wouldn't be rapping
See these streets made me, broke me down
Built me up, drove me crazy
Made me hungry, made you hate me, but fuck love
It don't make dollars, it don't make sense nigga
By the way, that's DJ Quik nigga, respect or check it
These days, I'm a little more focused
Cause y'all cracked the door and I kicked it open
Yellin' get the fuck down or I will shoot
I told you not to motherfuckin' move!
Be another example
I'll take the whole industry hostage if I have to
I'll sabotage this game, a good kid?
Yeah that's only in my mama's eyes
I seen a dead body at five and that shit made me traumatized
So These Days, a little blood on my hands ain't nothing compared
To hopping out a minivan, with a mini 22 3's and the homie TuTu
And two more YGs, oh nobody got time for that!
These Days it's only time for rap!
So Herbert Anthony Stevens
You make or break bread before we break even
Before they broke our records we broke records
And wrote pieces, of history
So These Days? These accolades that's meant for we?
It's only truth that this shit was meant to be, T.D.E
[Hook: Ab-Soul & JaVonte]
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Life is still a Traffic Jam)
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Life is still a Traffic Jam)
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Life is still a Traffic Jam)
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Ready to go)
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Still ready to go)
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Still ready to go)
Life's still a Traffic Jam
Life's still a Traffic Jam...

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Shit... what more did you expect? HiiiPower
For the most part, we go hard for the respect
I'm obviously ominous to my competition
And if I ain't better than Kendrick than nobody is then!
We shared our life with you
Shared our light with you even in the darkest of hours
In hopes that one day, just maybe, one day the world'll be ours
Ha, and now they look up to us like towers
For rhyming like we had super powers
They should've never let us in these offices...
Knowing good and God-damn well
How well we've been ducking officers
Laughing at the scraps they offered us in the past
And now we toast champagne to the thirst we never had!
I had my ups and downs, but I always left right
Rest In Peace Alori Joh... TopDawg for life!
And oh yeah... SOUL!
[Interlude]
I watch that fire that we're gathered around and see that it burns similar to the fire that is inside you...[Verse 1:]

Tell 'em, ok
Tell 'em I got plenty hustle to sell 'em
Heat by the fleet, displaying it very seldom
Lead how right to light ignite my cerebellum
Close to the pen like I had three felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
And the corpse is just another homie taking this course
Of course my dream was to play in the final four
Til the twelve grade came and I was only five four
So Now I’m a graduate, looking to get higher
My pops knew a security job, he inquired
But ignorance is bliss, that's what I was told
I stop, drop the role when somebody else fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed with a lot of free time
Which means he’s hungry or just a lot of free crime
I lived it in my rhymes, and when I hit the porch, this is what I realize
Wassup

Dorastałem
Wokół ludzi, ktorzy przeliczali życie na butelki
Dziadek miał złotą piersiówkę
Po niej pływał na plecach po Chicago
Niektórzy ludzie lubią to uczucie
Niektórzy chcą zapić smutki
Niektórzy chcą wpasować się w trendy
To był mój problem
Byłem w ciemnym pokoju
Głośna muzyka, wkrótce miałem
Złożyć przysięgę, że się napierdolę, więc napełniam szklankę
Widzę jak porusza się tłum
Wszystko zmienia się z minuty na minutę, ciągle ta sama piosenka
Jeden łyk, drugi łyk, a potem ktoś mówi:

[Refren]
Czarnuchu, masz zamiar przytulić tylko dwie czy trzy sety?
Pokażę ci, jak się trochę rozkręcić
Najpierw bierzesz basen pełen wódy, potem w nim nurkujesz
Basen pełen wódy, potem nurkujesz
Pomachałem kilkoma butelkami, wszyscy ustawili się w kolejce

Basen pełen wódy, zanurkuję w nim

Ok, teraz otwórz swój umysł i posłuchaj mnie, Kendrick
Jestem twoją świadomością, jeśli mnie nie posłuchasz
Będziesz tylko wspomnieniem, Kendrick
Wiem, że ci teraz niedobrze
Ale ja mam nadzieję doprowadzić cię do zwycięstwa, Kendrick
Jeśli wypiję jeszcze jednego, to chyba zwali mnie z nóg
Czuję ten rytm
Widzę miłość w jej oczach
Rozumiem to uczucie
Wolność nadchodzi z butelką wódki
Czerpiesz z tego korzyść
To rodzicielska troska
A ja najwidoczniej jestem pod wpływem tego, co robią oni

Mam basen pełen wódy, a oni w nim nurkują
Basen pełen wódy, zanurkuję w nim

[Bridge]
Nalej (wypiłeś), Headshot (wypiłeś)
Siadaj (wypiłeś), wstawaj (wypiłeś)
Odjechałeś (wypiłeś), obudziłeś się (wypiłeś)
Na*ebany, (wypiłeś), na*ebany (wypiłeś)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Watch how I kill 'em with the funky rhythm
Rappers I babysit 'em like soap operas they are my children
You dealing with the most phenomenon
My style raw like Madonna on, PCP
B-I-G, Frank White used to rock hand me down air nikes
Now I style proper, i gotta
Be laced in linen that's Versace
Polo fleeces, my bitches in Vicky secrets
Dom Perignon to carry on the festivities
Cristal when the sun go down
Anybody wanna touch me, the gun go "blaow"
It gets ugly, like New York momma, who want drama?
Biggie drop bombs like Osama, my bank account
What can i say? comma comma, comma
Kami-kaze, snap shots at you like papparazzi
Definition, Junior Mafia, ?

[Hook x2: Jay Rock]
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
All you heard was "Dot, don't hit me no more"
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
All you heard was "Punch, don't hit me no more"

[Verse 2: Punch]
It's Punch people, on a quest for the root of evil
Tread softly, death row is where the Ruger leave you
I'm no shooter, but you know my people
Blood pressure get to boilin', you know black people
They got them 44's, Macs, them Eagles
Pack them in the back of a Reagle, and come clap your people
Ride the track like a Mack truck on diesel, mattafact
I don't rap, i just do it for my people
It's so easy, treat the flow like a freethrow
Tryna' take me out my zone, watch me let three go
I'm 36, old, speak with eses, kilos
Icicle flow, yeah, I'm so below zero
Kick in the door if you try and play the hero
20 like the heat, you ? casino
[Hook x2: Jay Rock]
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
All you heard was "Dot, don't hit me no more"
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
All you heard was "Punch, don't hit me no more"

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I don't worry bout' none of you rappers
Most of y'all talking practice, actors like Denzel
Until you trapped in a lion den with stake
Under your chin, oh well, shouldn't play with Big Poppa
357 over my boxers
Magnum, tell the doctor I shot ya, ugh
Toe tag 'em, crack with purple tops, we bag 'em
House licks, we ski mask 'em, baby baby

[Verse 4: Punch]
Let me get it, let me sink my teeth in it
Put you niggas in a cobra clutch,with no submission
It's to the death, to the endin'
Push you to your final destination, hurry up, your casket waiting, who told you put a thought together ?
You brainstormin',  I control the weather, i'm thinking sunshine[Intro]
I know about killa California
Badmon no fear fi haunt ya
But we no care about not a thing at all
No if it kill, we buss ya boy

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
When I leave the house, I can't forget the weapon
Been through more shootouts than Hot 97
Equipped with the black Mac 11
Ain't no half steppin', Watts what I'm reppin'
Pull up, whip same color as fire
Obesity rims, anorexic tires
Bob Marley in the Swisher, I gotta get higher
The Grim Reaper handin' out tickets like flyers
Crips killin' Crips, Bloods killin' Bloods
Thats how it is now in Killa Cali, bruh
You gotta stay strapped, homie, never slip up
Bullets love skin, you'll get that ass touched
I glide through the streets, gat in my lap
One under the seat, K in the trunk like who want it with me?
Don't make it to trauma, you'll lying in sheets
We the last of a dying breed

[Hook]
I know about killa California
Badmon no fear fi haunt ya

No if it kill, we buss ya boy
Bo bo buss a shot for your area
Bo bo buss a shot for your area
Rah rah buss a shot for your area
Cause we no scared of yah
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm from the city where they concentrate on nothin'
But that red flag, blue flag, gang bang, murder state
Elementary kids liable they catch a case
So don't be surprised if a ten year old put one in your face
Kick in your door then put it to your face
Shake you up a little bit then ask you where the safe
Streets ain't safe and so I got the toolie on me
Movin' like a Mario brother, pardon me brother
But you gon' have to come out that whip, your mama might love ya but
I'm lovin' what's on your wrist, I'm lovin' what's on your neck
I'm lovin' what's in your head rest
You might as well give it to me or or be in peace with the rest deceased
Dippin' in lanes, duckin', dodgin' police
After we get away we celebrate over chronic tree
Who did you think rollin' with me?
K-Dot, Compton, visit my streets

[Hook]
I know about killa California

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Rock welcomes you to Killa Killa Cali
Thi-thi-this the murder capi' where them boys trigger happy
Concrete jungle, tell me who barrell a sparrow
It don't matter, we ghetto gotta gotta stack bundles
Don't matter the weather, man you gotta keep Berettas
Bullets rainin' like showers, they kill for money and power
Man that's murder murder get murdered at any hour
Any minute and any second I'm standin' tall as a tower
Ghetto strong survive, the weak get swallowed, devoured
Sorry there's no love for no cowards, if you one that's a problem
If you got a problem, we'll solve it for you, partner, no problem
If I can't reach you then my little homies got 'em
Niggas up on the hustle moving packs of that powder
Plus these bitches ain't shit, man it's all about a dollar
Bust a shot for my area with those 40 calibers
You gotta be a leader, got no respect for followers

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Whitney Alford]
Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence



[Chorus: Jay Rock & *Kendrick Lamar*]
*So what up Jay?*
Shit nothing but the money
*What you trying to say?*
More fifties more hundreds
*Who you trying to be?*
Who I already is
King of my city, that's no pop quiz

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Sitting in my Chevy smoking heavy on the best bud
Get it from the source
Got the best plug
Watts California be my city till the death bruh
You ain't hearing that?
Then you deaf blood
Moving like a snail
You can catch a slug
Hit you like a snare
I got big drums
Hunt for every dollar
I just stack funds
Yours is insufficient
That's why you mad huh?
Ever since I got a deal niggas hate me hard
So I keep a steel
Got no time to spar
Got no time to spare, money on my mind
Like hair
Like a flight of steps
All a nigga get is stairs
Big bag of green
Looking like a pear
When I hit a club
I'm leaving with a pair
Nigga I don't care
Bitch I'm a baller
Crash my whip today and cop another one tomorrow

[Chorus 2: Jay Rock & *Kendrick Lamar*]
*So what up Jay?*
Shit nothing but the money
*What you trying to say?*
More fifties more hundreds
*Who you trying to be?*
Who I already is
King of my city, that's no pop quiz
*So what up Jay?*
Shit nothing but the money
*What you trying to say?*
More fifties more hundreds
*Who you trying to be?*
Who I already is
King of my city, gotta get it how I live

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Me without a dollar is like a scholar with no smarts (whats that?)
That don't make sense don't it? (mm-mmh)
I'm in a Lamborghini with a Brazilian woman (oh yeah?)
Miss Novocaine
Suck my dick till she numb it (god damn)
You fly like a plane
But I'm more like a comet
Soaring over the atmosphere
I can hear the aliens cheer (ha)
Victory is sweet my dear (mm-hmm)
Here's the technique my dear (mm-hmm)
And maybe you can duplicate me
It's weird how y'all never can progress within the process
Of making residuals
I guess that you ain't I yet
Try to interfere with the dinero that I get
Watch y'all bear arms like women rub on my triceps duddy
Y'all is funny to me
You thought I came by myself nope
It's money with me
It's the root of all evil, but the need of all people
Yours is frail
I weigh mines on Brannon Scales

[Chorus: Jay Rock & *Kendrick Lamar*]
*So what up Jay?*
Shit nothing but the money
*What you trying to say?*
More fifties more hundreds
*Who you trying to be?*
Who I already is
King of my city, that's no pop quiz

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Miss me with that bullshit (Bullshit)
You ain't really wild, you a tourist (A tourist)
I be blackin' out with the purist (The purist)
I made a hundred thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I made 500 thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I bought a '87 for the weekend (The weekend)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (What you want)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (What you want)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
And it's like that, lil' bitch
MVP, I don't get no sleep, no, I don't like that, lil' bitch
Bust that open, I want that ocean, yeah that bite back, lil' bitch
Do it bite back, lil' bitch? Need two life jackets, lil' bitch
I ain't gon' hold you, I ain't gon' press you, never control you
I ain't gon' front you, keep it 100, I don't know you
Boss like Top Dawg, bossed my life up, crossin' over
Stutter steppin', got a Hall of Fame in all my posters
I've been ready, my whip been ready
My bitch been ready, my clique been ready
My shit's been ready, my check's been ready
My shot's on full, that's Armageddon
I got pull, I hope y'all ready
My tank on full, you know, unleaded
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it
My name gon' hold up, my team gon' hold up
My name gon' hold up, my team gon' hold up
My shots gon' fire, my team gon' roll up
Ménage à trois, my queen gon' roll up
I hope y'all ready, you know I'm ready
I reign all day, you know, confetti
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, skrrt
[Chorus: Future & Kendrick Lamar]
Miss me with that bullshit (Bullshit)
You're not a gang member, you's a tourist (A tourist)
I be blackin' out, I be blackin' out
Bought an '83 Cutlass for the weekend (For the weekend)
I got a hundred thousand, then I freaked it (Then I freaked it)
I made 500 thousand, then I freaked it (Then I freaked it)
I put a Rolls Royce on my wrist, oh yeah
Fuck his baby mama, tryna sneak diss
I took her to my penthouse, then I freaked it (Then I freaked it)
I haven't made my mind up, should I keep it? (Should I keep it?)
I got big dawg status, it ain't no secret

[Bridge: Future & Jay Rock]
La di da di da, slob on me knob

La di da di da, mothafuck the law
Chitty chitty bang, murder everything
Bitch, I'm on a roll, and I put that on the gang

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We like fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria
But I don't see it, I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic
Tapped in when I'm maxed in Comp-Town with the MAC-10s
And the pumps in the background I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
Everything else, but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Bùyào, bùyào"
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day, know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feelings, fuck your culture
Fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger
[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars

Thought they had to add the clothes (Yeah)
Tonight we unify society (Hey)
All my sisters and my bros (Yeah)
Against the wind, they gon' shoot us (Hey)
Regardless which way it blows (Yeah)
In the moon like we're Venus (Hey)
Kites like UFOs
Nigga hold the door (Nigga hold the door)

Nigga hold the door (Nigga hold the door)
There's room for some many more (Room for so many more)
Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Wake up in the morning, don't know if you're coming back
When we do the moshin', we make sense if we was done
Everybody need space, okay
If you got the light inside, you know you need the black!
If you want to shine way out!
If you want to shine way out!
Way, way, way out!
If you want to bring the day out

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell, Both, & A$AP Rocky]
Kites on my radar, life in my palms
We unite through the chaos (Only for the purist)
Tell them to obey ours
My cerebellum threw a rebellion from AR's
(Room full of boom sticks)
The day I have a J.R., I tell him to work for God only
And quit his day job (Motherfuck the bullshit)
Radio never play ours
This revolution ain't televised with prayer
Jumping over borders (Woo!)
Ain't no ruler for restrictions, ain't no police to deport us (Uh!)
Ain't no summers for our sons, ain't no dealings for our daughters (Woo!)
Every prosecution hung, save the verdict for the lawyers (Uh!)
Illuminate the corner (Woo!), celebrate humanity
And scream back at me in the morning (Uh!)
Every field in Mississippi, every street in California (Woo!)
Know the devil is a liar, it's the time to be anointed (Uh!)
Truck into a stream, disconnected to a dream
Head bussin', hittin' nothing, even if I gotta bleed
Sittin' waiting patient for a universal pain
Politicking with the nation, this is big as you and me huh?
I let you find my contacts, okay
Tryna set us off for combat, no way
Waking up the spirit it's on every human being
If you with us, then you scream so one day you can shine way out!
Me, I'm way, way out
Way out, way out
[Bridge: Pharrell & M.I.A.]
Way, way, way out
Hey, hey
Wanna bring the fucking crayon
Hey, hey

[Verse 4: M.I.A. & A$AP Rocky]
The girls in here are the humblest
We drink out our plastic tumblers
While you see us on Tumblrs
We wanna get a job as a baroness
They don't want no goddamn foreigners!
Say, "Hey, you, you wanna marry us?"
Carriers the cross, they carry us
I wanna get high 'cause I'm curious
I'm serious, I hope you are feeling us (Woo!)
I'm paying all these with periods (Uh!)
With mobiles are running delirious (Woo!)
It's our dream, out of this radius (Uh!)
I'm lettin' off kites to the barriers (Woo!)
I'm lettin' off kites to the barriers (Uh!)
I'm lettin' off kites to the barriers (Woo!)
Let-let-letttin' off kites to the barriers (Uh!)

[Outro: Chad Hugo]
There's room for so many more
Hey!

[Verse 1]
These streets is jurassic, cowards get asthmatic
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere, that the ghetto burb
Pull up on the curb (what's up homie!), smoke a nigga then dip
It's the immaculate, verbal assassin, strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This is Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry Low-Low with four zones of weed, no sticks no seeds
Prestigious when I post safe through fifty states, beneath the speed
Can corral the largest crowds, mosh pit with a big dick
Screaming bitches ain't shit, she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour, hardest Emcees softer than Clam chowder
No challengers can compete, they're childish and weak, detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein
I'm kurupted!

I'm kurupted!

[Verse 2]
Gimme a hundred G's for every Emcee I drop to their knees
Verbically useless, oh you got the Juice? I'll squeeze you juiceless
Catch you, hang you from many nooses
Been the truth since, Snoop and the pound was fuckin' over ruthless
Young and I'm ruthless, twenty-one with twenty-one guns, shottys thats looted from Pac, lyrical cyclops
Lazer-in 'em on paper and fraudulent friends, bitch you's a bitch in disguise and bitches get ten
Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal injection in a regal higher than church steeples, I swear to god
Count your lyrics in a jar, I'mma pterodactyl tearin' ya squad, like pardon me in Terrance Martin in Aston Martin
Cannibal co-existing with the coldest, that means I'm the sickest, and Theraflu won't do
Whenever I'm kicking the wickedness, explosive, syntagmatic, smokin' like the barrel of this tech aimin' at ya' neck
I'm kurupted!

I'm kurupted!

[Verse 3]
(Look homie) I'm from C-O-MP-TO-aNy nigga can get it, the little homie strapped and he with it
At the Avalanche swap-meet (what's up fool!)
Blunt longer than Rosecrans, I'll grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry, practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches, you are counterfeit
Worthless beats and verses surfaced. West Coast with a big scope kill all Y'all It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT
Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A.S.A.P
Complete havoc, compulsive disorder, rhyme addict -- Slaughter
House is full of Joey, Joells and Royces for ya'
Live from the area code of Three-One-Oh
Laughin' all the way to the bank with three Elmos
Three six-fo's, One bottle of Goose, I'm the truth, you could put your hand on the bible and shoot
I'm Kurupted!

[Outro]
See a lot of y'all get real disrespectful, real comfortable, not recognizin' ya' legends
West Coast legends, Young Gotti

I black out like Howard University when I verbally turn into Hercules hurtin' these Emcees early and urgently urkin' my nerves searching for certain certified nouns and verbs on the verge of vigorous victory. Kurupted



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Check, check, check, check, check
It go...

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
To the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
Maybe this Earth is ain't a good place to be
How far is heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer
What I'm doing, I'm saying that I'm human, now people just

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
It go one (one), two (two), three (three)
Two in the front, one in the back seat (seat)
Seat (seat), seat (seat), seat (seat)
Looking for a victim of an AK-47 100-round each, each, each
But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?
I don't know, I look for the answers later
"Make a right, there they go!"
Sometimes you gotta

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wilding, a young'n with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems
Mo' money, mo' drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
That's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life
But regardless I'ma-

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause I never know
When a bullet might hit me and I die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live my life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what I is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

[Verse 4: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah, life can please you, but death can tease you
On the day Niko had that seizure
I lost one of my biggest believers, aww!
Close deaths make you think about your life
Like if I had that same chance twice, what would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more, do more
But tease her 'bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording
Swear, I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in heaven, saying, "They at it again"
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?
"Momma, I just wanna sing"
Momma said, "According to get everything...
You gotta risk everything"
So I'm smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians



[Intro]
Take me back to LA
Take me back to LA
Take me back to LA, ohh

[Verse 1]
I've laughed and I've cried
I've lived and I've died
Stole from, gambled and cheated
Cut corners outside
I've tried and I've failed
Stood tall when they'd run
I've fought a cold war
In the dead of the hot sun

[Chorus]
Now take me back to LA
Where the weather is good
Take me back to LA
Don't wanna give the road a second look

[Post-Chorus]
And I remember first time that I left
Pain, it flooded the wells of your eyes
You said you'd never forgive me if I didn't make it back
But now I'm comin' home for some good lovin'

[Verse 2]
I've learned and I've taught
I've gained and I've lost
Made due with what I'm made of
Found out what love cost
Learned who I can't trust
Learned that it's just us
I've learned to love mine
Even when it ain't much

[Chorus]
Now take me back to LA
Where the weather is good
Take me back to LA
Don't wanna give the road a second look

[Post-Chorus]
And I remember first time that I left
Pain, it flooded the wells of your eyes
You said you'd never forgive me if I didn't make it back
But now I'm comin' home for some good lovin'

[Outro]
Take me back to LA
Take me back to LA
Take me back to LA, ooh



[Intro: Nate Howard]
It's just me out here
At least that's what it feels like
They said I wouldn't make it
That this was a City of Broken Dreams
But somehow lost angels broke cages
They seen animals, we made stages
Became famous by freeing the world of their own danger
Prison mentalities, we're all hanging from propaganda
Victim-blaming, all divided with remainders of Mikes, Trayvons, and Oscars
Given to common legends, no acting
The new Selma is happening right now
Momma I made it
I killed this freestyle before they killed me
They saw Rodney, you saw a king
Realize how powerful you are and break free

[Chorus: Brandy & James Fauntleroy]
LA, can't believe I fell in love in the city of LA
LA, it's the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we fell in love in LA, LA, LA
We fell in love

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
In the city of the gangbang
Yeah, we still dying over red and blue stripes
Chuck my set up and it feel good
Cause  don't nobody love you more than your neighborhood
We always had bitches, we don't love those
Grew up around the gangsters and the cutthroats
Be careful where you at, you might get bust on
Yeah, all my South Central niggas, Inglewood, twist your fingers up
Compton and Watts, Eastside, always turning up
Bad bitches up at Greystone and Supperclub
Tell 'em where we're from like

[Chorus: Brandy & James Fauntleroy]
LA, can't believe I fell in love in the city of LA
LA, it's the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we fell in love in LA, LA, LA
We fell in love

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
God, let me right my wrongs, God, let me write this song
God in the middle with a month
Let me hit the pawn shop, momma said we need a loan
God, let me dedicate this to the 80% that ain't never coming home
God, let me know you exist
In a city where a hundred hollow-tips get thrown
I'm off that Centennial
Fuckin' at the party, nigga, at the party, we fade ten or more
My hood came thinkin' we yellin', "We in this bitch"
Then we yellin', "We in your bitch"
Or you tellin' all of us our dwellin' inside of 2Pacalypse, thug life
And we off that whoopty-whoopty-whoop
And we in that hoopty with the two choppers
So we're guaranteed to shoot
Lock us in the L.A. County zoo
Watch us eat a bear alive and ooh
This feels so good to keep it true
This feels so good, I'm keepin' you
Hope I'm teachin' you all the lessons I learned
When I made that turn off the 110
Watch that marijuana just burn
This shit just make you wanna just sin
See that Staples Center high earnin' if the Lakers get me a win
I'm gon' liquor shot in memory of Pac, Makaveli live again
Bitch, I'm in L.A. yeah, yeah, motherfucker

[Chorus: Brandy & James Fauntleroy]
LA, can't believe I fell in love in the city of LA
LA, it's the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we fell in love in LA, LA, LA
We fell in love

[Verse 3: James Fauntleroy]
My nigga so many fell down 'round here and they won't tell
And I ain’t talking love girl but I know how you feel
And you've been living in fear
Remember I'm right here
They got your world on wheels
Girl let’s roll through them hills off the ten
Rolling, with ya cousin & em
Real shit ain't nobody fake, they is and they ain’t from here

[Bridge : Ty Dolla $ign, Brandy]
City of LA, city of LA (City of LA)
City of LA, South Central, Inglewood
City of LA, Compton, Long Beach, Watts City, LA

[Chorus: Brandy & James Fauntleroy]
LA, can't believe I fell in love in the city of LA
LA, it's the city of angels, it can take you anywhere
LA, LA, LA, we fell in love in LA, LA, LA
We fell in love

[Outro: TC]
This is where it started all off nigga
But now, look at where we at now, like what the fuck
I mean you... the first song is "L.A."
So then after that, it goes from LA to all over the world



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I love money, I love bitches for the lack of better words
Ain't got no time, ain't got no feelings for the lack of better words
I miss your call four time this evening for the lack of better words
The music loud, can't hear it ringing for the lack of better words

[Verse 2: SZA]
You got nothing left to offer but a lack of better words
Get nothing else from me but a lack of better words
Had a nickel every time you get a lack of better words
Feeling cheap to be your woman for the lack of better words

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
But I say my ego gotta yeet for the lack of better words
I can't love you, I love these streets for the lack of better words
But if it's true, you would trust me for better or for worse
I'm selfish, I can't help it, for the lack of better words

[Verse 4: SZA]
You gon' be like this forever for the lack of better words
You gon' get your shit together, no, no you never learn
You cannot do better for the lack of better words
Never can let you forget it any time you on my nerves

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Na, na, na, all you do, make excuse
Na, na, na, all you do, is make excuse

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
(Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy)
I wish a nigga would (ah!)
I wish this nigga (uh!)
I wish a nigga would
I wish this nigga (yeah!)
I wish your mhm-mhm-mhh
I wish this nigga (uh!)
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga (yeah!)
Stuck in a rock and a hard place [inaudible]
God damn, bitch, hoe, huh
Yeah, woah



[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official

[Kendrick Lamar]
Let me tell you when it all started
Game dropped Documentary and made plenty enemies
It was a classic album, but prior to that
Guerilla Black debuted and put the city on wax
A lot of Biggie comparisons, we all was aware of them
But that wasn't my M.O., I just thought he was dope
Can't understand why Game would say his name in that manner
Many years went by, still no legitimate answer
Anyway, I put out a mixtape in 12th grade
Hub City threat, minor of the year, DJ Dave
And his brother designed, put together the music
Put it out to the people, the people said I was stupid
With the flow, went to the barbershop to show off my skills
Mike and Himey and some other cat said I was real
Himey was Games barber, the other cat made a statement
Saying that Game was his partner, so I gave him my tape
Said he'd play it for him, hoping that I'd get my big break
But never got a response.. anyway
This nigga named Pop Gates came to my school with a camera
I freestyled on his DVD for a minute then after
It hit the streets, I was known as K. Dot from Compton
Man Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin'
But I didn't have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me
Until I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet
Me at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour
Told me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour
Jay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape
Was skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed
But we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap
Did our first collaboration on the Nephew track
He got signed months later, Warner Brothers
We started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper
Before Sidekicks became a modern day phone
Same time our buzz was generated from G Malone
He had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it
Said that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget
Now that's a smart nigga, I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life
But not knowing how to market it right
Turned on the radio
Only cat new from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop
And by then this nigga' buzz was tremendous
In the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft
What the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up
It was a hit
When I heard it
But all we had was the instrumental and the hook
But when
Rock jump on it for certain, it was to smash
Gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion
Next thing you know, the record was
Spinning
That was a good look, it set the coast on fire
Niggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot
Then these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station
Ask why they record ain't playin', what you niggas complaining, about?
Shit was funny to us tho
Niggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo
In the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy
I had a situation with Def Jam, premature
Shit went sour after Jay-Z left but they didn't care
I was glad Jay-Z gave me respect
See I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock
Far as radio play, obvious, he got a lot
Beefing’ with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it
Which in my opinion, I didn’t think the shit was impo’tant
But that’s a whole ‘nother story, we hit the lab with Game
And a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy
Did the cypher freestyle and everybody’s like, "Wow"
These Top Dawg niggas ‘bout to make noise"
Surely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that
But right after that, we didn’t see him no more
G Malone came with a smash hit with Akon
Mistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm
Then everybody start to scream out the new West
And claim that West Coast legends don’t want to see him at best
I think that’s just an excuse, because their music ain't tight
Tell ‘em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice
Then Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin’ the internet
But he been a threat since Deathrow, then Roccett came about
And all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2Eleven too
It finally started to look like the West was makin’ moves
Western Union had the whole block boomin’ because of Snoop
Matter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group
Then ?Problem? took off, another Compton native
We both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it
By this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves
We almost got into some major beef over Lil’ Wayne
That part I'mma leave out
Theres certain things that the streets only should know about
Shout out to Nipsey
Bishop win that game, then had a fight with X.O
That’s when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me
Because they didn’t see my views, grab the hottest album out and re-do it
That’s a goddamn power move stupid
You foolish, don’t know shit about this war shit
Theres mo’ shit to wanting to be the king of the coast shit

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
So two weeks ago I finally run into the nigga I gave my mixtape too
And said he was partners with Game
The nigga finally told me what he said
He said he didn’t like it
But the niggas like
“See, see, look at you, look at you now, I tried to tell him you was tight”
Nigga probably never even gave it to him and shit

[Ended with shout outs]



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps
Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests
Yes

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Still face, play me short like an oompa loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killas man, people who killed men
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film, man
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
Cause they know that they don't know Kendrick fo' sho
And oh

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photobook to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killas, chasing hits
Lying to yourself, all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My Mama said, "Boy, that don't sound like you."
I said, "This is the sound, though."
My only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watch the Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life, to mix it up in a blender
To make sure that you feel me

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Interlude: Female Voice Speaking]
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar. what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, is this really you?
Is this who you are? What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
Of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of Rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be frontin'
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
And all I could say is, "Will the radio care?"
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my hip-hop when I was 16 years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
22, like the smallest of guns that you know
Most determined, but with the smallest of funds to show
But I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn as soon as my records spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focused, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar, and soon ya'll know Cloud 9, ya'll
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word, righteous
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word

[Outro: Female Voice]
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word

[Verse 1: Dido]
Don’t wrap it up in gold
Don’t hide it behind the sun
Just give it to me as it is
And let it stand
Don’t fly it like a kite
Between the clouds
It needs no excuse
Just bring it down
Let eyes that are in pain look upon it
In all its glory

[Chorus: Dido]
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

[Verse 2: Dido]
For every voice that is lifted
In reverence and pain
Show us now
And let love not be chained
We should feel what we can stand
And let us be alive
So we know
That we’ve done all we can
Let hearts that are frozen get to see it
In all its glory
[Chorus: Dido]
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

[Bridge: Dido]
And let all that is lost be forgotten
And it will pass
So let all that is lost be forgotten
Let us move on

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Like the waters in the open sea
When tribulations come all we can say is hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
But today I'm overly dedicated, I'm 'posed to be
A testimony for broken hearts in the city
You either crash landing or planning on flying with me
Misery loves standing behind its company, well
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that it's a appealing to pop a pill, that's a downer
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
I heard when you see a thug, that's what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings, but I'm still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say
[Chorus: Dido]
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

[Verse 1: Dido]
Don’t wrap it up in gold
Don’t hide it behind the sun
Just give it to me as it is
And let it stand
Don’t fly it like a kite
Between the clouds
It needs no excuse
Just bring it down
Let eyes that are in pain look upon it
In all its glory

[Chorus: Dido]
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

[Verse 2: Dido]
For every voice that is lifted
In reverence and pain
Show us now
And let love not be chained
We should feel what we can stand
And let us be alive
So we know
That we’ve done all we can
Let hearts that are frozen get to see it
In all its glory

[Chorus: Dido]
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

[Bridge: Dido]
And let all that is lost be forgotten
And it will pass
So let all that is lost be forgotten
Let us move on

I heard when you see a dove, that's what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings, but I'm still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say

[Chorus: Dido]
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short

Let us move on
Let us move on

I reel 'em in for the fishing pole
I love legs like Robyn Fenty
Stretch them shits like limo Bentleys
Catch them tits with an open mouth
The interview up outta that Oprah house
You know I love it when it's pokin' out
You know I'm thuggin' even in the drought, you know him
I fuck around and crash a brand new Bugatti
In the mothafuckin' lobby so you know I'm in the building
Won't you kiss it, baby? Take a picture
I, I, I, I, I'm killin' em
Illuminati want my money and my body
Even Donny rollin' by me, looking aggravated that I made it
Fuck you and your mama, nigga
I, I, I, I, I see the bitch in them, I got the Benjamin
I got the dividend, I'm on my toes like Serena at the Wimbledon
Pie à la mode on a Monday for my woman-friend
I'm in the mode of a mortal man
I'm living in the orbit of deliverin'
Sex in a cathedral, empty, Grand Marnier that I reload, ten Gs
In the hallway, she a Leo, I'm a Gemini
Give me mine, genocide, kill 'em all, thirty times

My turbo boostin', my jetpack cruisin'
Get jet lag when I come back to these fuckin' humans
I could put planet Earth in a canister
Then continue my crater search, with Captain Kirk
Look at my verse, you seein' signs?
You hearin' signals deciphered from District 9
No fuckin' rapper-cypher when meteors flyin'
The meters are flyin' but I'm way faster
Run away bet I catch ya, fire like striking matches
I'm higher with martians laughin' in spaceships as stars is crashin'
Hover above the masses, a massive attack we're mixin'

Niggas—wanna hop on track—bitches—wanna hop on dick—

Kendrick Lamar young nigga
Before I ever wear a chain I make sure you know my name
I'm the same good kid from the block where you was raised
Didn't have a pot to piss in peeing in your pj's
You see my story is a story untold by the kid from Compton making straight a's for new clothes
Surrounded by bullets from one of my relatives foes
Because he been a killer since he was 12 years old
The price of being guilty by association got me places I ain't ever been
Like in back of the swap meet niggas trynna test my chin
Squaring up like a nerd before summer school begin
Then break when bullets breaks wind
All I wanna do is rap
But it's a wrap
When you living inside of Iraq and
George Bush in the quote of sack
You get pushed and you righteous act
It's a murder charge on your back
Can I captivate this captive before you try peel my cap
Can I live
Huh
Kendrick Lamar

[Outro Donny Hathaway Snoop Dogg]
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save meUh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Uh
Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I'm  a thinker not a drinker but still I Hennessey drag;
Alcohol numbs the pain like where Novacane stabs
In your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on em
Colours corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted Crips and Pirus cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Quran can save;
Welcome, don't be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights;
Stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
I'm twenty-two, at twenty I knew I was against the odds;
This kid named Jonathan was monitoring
His momma and sister, his older cousin, he honoured him;
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
To Johnny, he might've been
A modern day rider then
He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a MAC-11 now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what's his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
More gangster under the family tree, took 'em under his wings like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching T-shirts that says "The hood made me"
No love, just spread slugs, that's the policy, the leader and the prodigy;
Now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
With blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades and licks
Going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace
Thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour;
The power of banging, he was walking from...(gunshots)
Little Johnny
[Outro: Voice of Malcolm X and (Kendrick Lamar)]

I think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time
When black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough
To think for themselves as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
And this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
And then at that point you will have a situation
Where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
And this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
And this type of thinking also will bring an end to the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
It's something that the black man has to bring an end to

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Lifestyles of the kid who never had shit
Living off that bad shit, that shoot shit, that stab shit
Rock a flag and don’t give a fuck about U.S flag shit
George Bush got some nerve, fuck a war, we trying to serve
Motherfucking 8 balls, til’ we live at the pool hall
And knock billiards out of your business, ya bitch
Thats my surroundings in Compton, have common sense
Smell death in the air, around here, thats a common scent
You know the gunpowder
You know when your homie barely blink, he just done powder
Only at seventeen
You know the common statistic inspired by hoop dreams
Now hire about street schemes, and getting blood money
I try my best to stay focused and hope the city love me
Pray it's not lust, cause if it is, I’d be death in a month
Lord forbid, for the good kid
They took his life
She want her baby back, like a cooked rib
But that’s just life, where I’m from

[Hook]
If there’s a shining star
Hope my city is not too far
So we can live again
See, where I come from is hard
Hope all over, we can start
So we can live again, so we can live again

[Verse 2: CurT@in$]
I’ve seen this young’un on the train, I had to pick his brain
He said he on his way uptown to get a brick of caine’
He said he needed a come up, because selling nicks' was lame
He needed a change, so I gave him fifty cent
He looked up at me like I was crazy, I said listen man
I rather give you my last to see you live again
Just cause you change what you pitching, don’t make the difference
You gotta get off the mound, and put the game down
Petty thoughts could keep your brain down
I leave you with that jewel, go get the chain now
And put it together
You see coming up, we ain’t have that shit to keep our mind focused
I love Mike, but it was a hassle trying to buy Jordans
My nigga hustle all day in front of the corner store
To get a pair, niggas killed him right in front the mall
So all the hustling for nothing man
I threw my pair on the lightpole because of him
Like fuck it man

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Trying to move foward, though it never stops
A mother’s son dead, was killed by some kids popped
Shots, they back and forth
Murder for murder, the beef recycled is light
No idols, bunch of unread bibles
Allies that turned to rivals, niggas turned street disciples
Smokers get high as Eiffiels
Addicted to being fiends
Because of the feds as we pledge to let our plague spread
Tiny this and if and that if they banging back
Because they
Adapt to being black, strapped and gang tats, look
Rats get mouse trapped
Can’t afford tuition
But hit a lick I bet I earn crack, I heard that
Looking at the sky, hoping a light would shine
Daylight saving times all the time on this block of mines
All the time with this Glock of mines
Swear to God man it ain’t a rhyme, I grind for a piece of mine
Co-sign

[Hook]

[Bridge/Outro: Black Ice]
When you look at my brothers, what's your first impression?
Does the sight of us leave you guessing?
Or do you understand the stressing, the aggression
The look of no hope on my niggas' faces
Like the Lord overlooked us when He handed down His graces
See embraces, fall short on the numb tips of street entrepeneur fingers
Stuck in the walls of the project halls where the Coke smell still lingers -
External blingers is all we can be
Cause on the inside we been given nothin to shine on
And the gig is harder to get than Coke so niggas get their grind on
Because the TV tells us aim high Nigga, make all goals lateral
But that takes paper that we don't have so niggas put their souls up as collateral
Now, some niggas reclaim 'em, some blame 'em
Making excuses to sell 'em
But when a nigga goes from not doin', to doin'
What can you tell him?
Not to be a nigga?
Shit I gots to be a nigga that's how I pay the bills and I'mma do that whether I gotta sling this coke or exploit these rhyme skills

I want you
To live in my bed
Why don't you
Just live in my bed
Then I can wake up
To your face
Whenever I open up my eyes
So why don't you just live in my bed

[Verse 1- Frank Anthony]
Pack your bags
Come get away baby don't look back
I got a pillow with your name on it
Don't hesitate to put your head on it
Just stay the weekend
My bed will make you want to move in
If you wanna we can sleep in
Baby here's a proposition
Listen

[Verse 1- Kendrick Lamar]
Baby come here
Hit the freeway then I switch gears
Drive pass to it, let my love pass through it
We'd be living in the mist of the wonder years
We can hear the drop of tears
Every time we drop the top
Do it anywhere, do it here, do it there
Leave the mall and do it in a parking lot
Ooo, you look so sexy
Not to many impress me
Then she reply
"My God, boy, shut the fuck up and just undress me"
Damn you're gorgeous
Runnin' circles in my head
Now baby girl, pack your bags and catch a cab

[Chorus- Frank Anthony]
I want you
To live in my bed
Why don't you
Just live in my bed
Then I can wake up
To your face
Whenever I open up my eyes
So why don't you just live in my bed

Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Jump in the coup and I'm gone
I smell like money, I don't need no cologne
I just need me a freak
That can jump on the bone
Like an X-Ray technician
My rectangular prism
Says money sex then drugs
All cause I'm 21
Like playing blackjack
Picture this kodak
Moment forever
K.Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite
I'm that cool
[Bridge]
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Bottle of goose and I'm gone
Watching her get loose
Like a third graders tooth
The shit that we on
Is the ultimate high
Double XL flow
That's the ultimate vibe
Park that Lambi' outside
Just to fuck with the haters
Put the Lami' in drive
Watch 'em peel like potatoes
Holla' LMAO
When they drunk and two-step
Like I never could pass
A sobriety test
[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm in the club I can manage
Providing lenses
Make my view panoramic
I'm out of this world
I'm off of this planet
They don't say K.Dot is here
They say his spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted
Like a kitchen floor
But my floor is marble
I ride in the carpool because I got two whores
In the back of that chrome
See they're all I need
Like Aaliyah alone

Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is mе
Kendrick, and I wear pendant on my shouldеr
Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well
We don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickridin'
I'm addicted to Westsidin'
Livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin'

[Intro]
Uh, shoutout to ScHoolboy Q
He uglier than a motherfucker (laughs)

[Verse]
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC, oh my God, you gotta see
There’s never no I's in me
Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I’m so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don’t care where ya are
Just blink twice and I’m there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It’s gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I’ma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I’m going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J’s put us in PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although I’m in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Take it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, he’s slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I’m un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I’m a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I’m a factor and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, Fuck!

[Intro: Michael Jackson & Busta Rhymes]
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, I know, it's been a minute
Don't you know?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, you need me (Woo)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Michael Jackson]
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy, don't argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors, and novel spitters
And it's all for the literature
And it's all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the Chlamydia, uh
I ain't afraid to say I need you, ah, yeah (Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
I promise I'd never leave you, ah, yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure, my folks unite soon as the flow get nice
The poltergeist that scare emcees, my prototype for every
My share of deeds and R.I.P.s
You know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently, my appetite stay famished
Bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen (Look over your shoulder)
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
I'm 'posed to shine, remind I'm king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros, the cons, the diamond rings
I'm full with time but I'ma bring
The soul divine and cross between
What's yours and mines, the gold, the green
The ropes that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals (Scream)
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies, you Chris Rock
Hit the Pookie and pit stops
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over, it's love
I know ya (Woo)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, yeah, you need me (Woo)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes & Michael Jackson]
Shhh, look over your shoulder, get me?
'Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin' 'til they anointed me one of the kings of Black history
And yes, I see the game is a little different, niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit 'em like darts 'til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me
And you gon' make my gun cock and talk a whole 'nother way, yo
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh (Woo)
I am the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believer-er maker
So pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake 'em
So rude, I'm so ice cold but I'm what you need to just wake 'em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em
When I arrive, my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
'Cause I'm the god of the harder, the martyr, the father
I spit a saliva that's leaking a lava
Completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin'
And beating you niggas, completely conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga, you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga, believe me
Graffiti your armor, you heebie, you jeebie
Bikini your broad up (You guinea pig)
See me, now give me the startup and treat me
You greet me and meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak, have a seat, it was deep
I was sleep, now the god's up, hmm
Upholding the fundamentals, while most of you boast a rental
Focus on what's most essential, spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your entendimiento?
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder, boy, and wonder (Woo)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Nikki Grier]
Don't you know, baby? (Ooh, woah)
Don't you know, baby? (Mhm, oh, yeah)
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me (When you need me)
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me (Whenever you need me)
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, you need me (Woo)
Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me

[Outro: Chris Rock & Michael Jackson]
That's right
He got catalog, you understand? (Just look— Just over your shoulders)
This is the motherfucking human iPod out this motherfucker, okay?
He can go all day (Go all day)



[Intro: Michael Jackson & Busta Rhymes]
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah, I know, it's been a minute

Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!

With God watchin' over us and me over your shoulders (All you had to do is look forward)
But what you gonna do, you pull the devil even closer (Why'd you pull the devil even closer?)
Them clowns that you hang with more ridiculous than white Cleopatra or Caucasians telling blacks to go back to Africa
But I digress, you're more, but you act less
Why do you act less even still, when the weight of life feels like a boulder (Just look over your shoulders)
I'm here whenever you need me
When you need me
Whenever you need me, when you need me

[Verse 1: Solange]
Hey little heartache, skipping out of town
And let’s stay out of trouble, you make it look good
Hey young heartache, you’re looking kinda charming
On the cul-de-sac, where nobody comes looking
Hey, little heartache, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good
Hey young lover, let’s live on the Broadway
Take me to the Bridge but be sure to come look
Hey young heartache, you’re looking kinda charming
On the cul-de-sac, hope nobody comes looking
Hey, young lover, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good

[Hook]
And there ain’t nobody loving me, down
The way you make me go places I forbid
And the spaces I should have known
And there ain’t nobody breaking me down
The way you make me go places I forbid
And the spaces I should have known

[Verse 2: Solange]
Hey little heartache, won’t you leave your mark
In corners of the dark where you make it look good?
We’ve taken this too far
But let me play the part where you should’ve stayed put
Hey, little heartache, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good
Hey young lover, let’s live on the Broadway
Take me to the Bridge but be sure to come look
Hey young heartache, you’re looking kinda charming
On the cul-de-sac, hope nobody comes looking
Hey, young lover, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
In the late week, I was in London
I really wanna get into something
Bus way too cold (way too cold)
And I don’t wanna feel that numbness
And I just had a show, and I wanted you to go
But you had one too, I was wondering
Are the time gods on my side?
If so, God, press that button
Stuck on a tall-ass bus
Like 14 bunks and I can’t even sleep
And I hate getting drunk so I don’t got a cup
But I’ve got James Mason on repeat
I’m tryna stay on that good thing
You know?
Whatever song Heaven would sing
You know?
Broken up Alphabets
How can I get this convo to stay comprehensive
When the service is never working
And the Wi-Fi is out commission
And I’m not short with you on purpose
I’m a man of just few words
If you like to chat, then in fact
My job is to make sure you’re heard
Ms. Chatty — I’m like one message from calling a taxi
Exactly, I’ll catch a cold but as long as you match me
It’s actually a troublesome world when you think about it
So admit it, we both could look good with it if you’re the stylist
Hold up…
Digga-da digga-da digga-da da
Digga digga digga da digga da da
You stay in that dank lounge, I'mma sit an decide
And P.S., the Olive Oils always love the Popeyes, I guess
I guess…Death

I gotta ball for my dead homies

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar, SZA & Both]
Smoking dodo in your mama house
She get off work early, cussing at us, and kick us out
Popping wheelies on aqueducts in the summer
We stealing minibikes whistle when Gonzalez was coming
And I remember Shaniqua gave you the cold shoulder
Says she don't fuck with niggas that's chirping on Boost Mobiles
I'm laughing at you and praying that the choppers don't catch you (Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never)
We ditching third period just to fuck your school up
We know where you from homie, uniforms can't fool us
Chalk it up like you s'posed
Cornrows with the zags in the middle
Platinum FUBU jeans, rubber bands wrapped around the denim
I remember...
(Ooh, I remember)
I can feel when you around
You forever hold it down
I return the favor when I'm on stages
In love and memory, no enemy could separate us
And so I gotta say this
How I'm laughing, now I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
How I fought you, I hugged you, I remember (Oh, I remember)
I love it even if I get no bigger
You're forever my dawg, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking 'bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo
(Woo-woo-woo-woo)
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Pushing foreigns, flying cars
Poppin' trophies, by the mall
Bring back Derek, Stunna Deuce
Pat Dawg that's my cousin, love him too

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar, Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
Wishing I could reverse, us patrolling the turf
Tam's burger for breakfast, chili fries on my shirt
Granny said go to church, how often did we listen?
Sunday school wasn't cool, let's be getting at bitches
Aw man, I got weight on my shoulder
Aw man, I got
Aw man, I got so many angels to feed
Look to the heavens, they depend on me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar, SZA & Both]
This personal, I hope you know my loyalty
Will always run deep
So I put it down two times
When I'm on these beats
Put my candle in the street
Put my faith in where you at
Gone, but you're not forgotten
Chad, I promise I'll be back
I'm saying
I'm laughing, I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
I fought you, I hugged you, I remember (Ooh, I remember)
I love it even if I get no bigger
You're forever my dawg, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking 'bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo
(Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Ba-Ba, bow-bow)
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and still need some help (I am)
You outlast the world, if your heart is real (I am)
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and still need some help (I am)
You outlast the world, if your heart is real (I am)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (Out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (Love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts—brace!
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo!"
‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place (Ah, fuck)
But you confirmed my low-end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No, (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under— (*slurp*) —stand, (*slurp*)
I (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*hic*) anyone, (*hic*) ever (*slurp*)"
Yeah, that ain't what they all say?
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the—

[Pre-Chorus: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch, "I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick"
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me—fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day!" (*Phone hangs up*) Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the—

[Pre-Chorus: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (with Eminem)]
(She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more)
(She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more)
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' seventy-three, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's layin' next to me in bed—directly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, "Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab"
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, "Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*Car crashes*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
You're late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of— (*Message sound*)
Wait, "dinner at eight"? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the—

Game of love, love, love, love

There’s a lot of girls in this crowd, but you’re the only one I find special
My bars are here to address you
Baby you’re a star, don’t ever let a nigga stress you
Let’s get in the car, cause  that’s the only way I can confess to you
Get to know you more while drivin’ cause later on tonight I’m tryna undress you
Open your car door, to show that I was raise right
Cause I know that’s gonna impress you
Baby, don’t think I’m here to play you

[Verse 2: L.Leflore Jr.]
Okay
I’m on the way
We ain’t got time to waste
Listen to the words i’ma say
That kitty I’m tryna taste
I do this shit everyday
You’re someone I ain’t scared to chase
She made me smile today, when I saw her pretty ass face
At the end of the day, my life was in a better place
She kinda blush today, when I had my hands around her waist
Yeah, I’m the kid with the “nigga naps” but also with the sweetest raps
Bars like Coles, attitude like Kenny
Lord I know, you’re always be with me
I got goals, so baby don’t be scared to achieve them with me
We all know, who’s really ridin’ with me
I wanna have somethin’ real, like Bobby and Whitney
I’m being for real, I feel that you’re the only one that gets me
[Refrain: L.Leflore Jr. (Zacari)]
If my mind wasn’t this fucked up, would you still (love me)?
If I went out and commit a crime, would you still (love me)?
Keep it real, I'd rather have you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it for real, without you equals nothin’

I said I'm geeked and I’m fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high (High, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (Die for, fire)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (I’m on fire)

It's a secret society
All we ask is trust (All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millennium
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it’s EDM
Gas in the bitch like it’s premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I’m a natural, I'm alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I’m a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (Yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (Yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby[Verse]
Yeah, that's cool
Thirty two shots in the clip of his thirty four's a little nigga with heart
Frustrated with being broke while I was climbing the charts
Penitentiary chancin' and dancin' with suicide
[?] is connoisseurs, love to eat on our tribe
Homie I got love for him
Angel on angel dust, I used to thug for him
Took me on my first mission, transition
Good kid turned rapper, pay attention
This is deeper than you think
Right after my admission inside the game, asked him bout whats his name
We brushed it off as a joke as we watched her get off the stage
Music award [?] for all of the nominee
I was promised to win, he was promised to leave
With all the favorite accessories
The one's the big budget videos had especially
Just a shadow in the dark, blendin' in with all the industry friends
So guess this is where the story begins, J Incredible, what![Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water, something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood a-rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much? Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch—let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, "It's okay"

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar & RAT BOY]
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—

Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy—hol' up
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water, something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood a-rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much? Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch—let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, "It's okay"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
"Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord"
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water, something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood a-rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much? Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch—let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, "It's okay"Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5
When I kick it, I kick it as if the beat was my enemy
You have thought it was tender me on point like a widow P
Got that leverly give them dearies that do what it do
Payin a picture like duderline, you ain't shit but do do
In the city where see me get pointed that damn it you
You can hide, you get it if you want to
I do karate moves but the crushing tiger just might get broken down by a writer
Yeah the passenger hopped out
But you got shot by the driver
There's a killer like everywhere
So why would you take it there
Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
That's why my intelligence tell me to keep a banker you
Tell me f*ck you I'll tell you f*ck you back with my index finger
I can flip on some killershit but I'd rather keep cool
Keep it sober minded try not to be a p**sy like you
Nigga that kale cold attack, Cali on my back till my torso break nigga
This is where it's at that's gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5

Make em close as stigiuos, hells kitchen I'm blowing dishes

She cold with a bow and ribbon the role of riches
Low the bisquits let's go to distance
I'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broken mission
They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions
Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison
Call adrenaline I got this soul like a poe living
And.like I'm co-existent to prohibition
I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it
Mother of statistics they rap with metaphysics
And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition
Show some recognition hold your .my pessimistic
Best that ever did it, Papoose is the definition

Painting a picture like doodling, dude you ain't shit but doo-doo
In the city where the semis get pointed at him, them and you
You can hide, you get, if you want to, I do karate moves
But the crouching tiger just might get broken down by a writer
Yeah the passenger hopped out, but you got shot by the driver
There's a killer like everywhere, so why would you take it there
Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
That's why my intelligence tell me to keep a banger
Tell me "fuck you" I'll tell you fuck you back with my index finger
I can flip on some killershit but I'd rather keep cool
Keep it so remind it try not to be a pussy like you

Road to riches, load the biscuits let's go the distance

They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions
Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison
Cold adrenaline I got this soul like a poet's living

I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it
Disrespect the spirit, or the artist who rap with lyrics
Mother-F statistics they rap with metaphysics
And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition
Show some recognition
Heard your album my best of missed it
Best that ever did it
Papoose is the definition

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all—duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!—

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?

[Scratches]
​m.A.A.d city
Compton

[Outro]
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that



(Volume increases with 2Pac talking in the background:)
...It's gone be like Nat Turner, 1831

[Intro/Refrain 1 & 2 - Kendrick Lamar]
Aye, on my mama, nigga
I'ma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On, my mama, though, like

But, I told 'em "I can't sugarcoat the answer for you
This is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody getting killed"
Tell me what you do for love
Loyalty and passion of all the memories collected
Moments you could never touch
Let somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman, touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brothеr
You should chip a nigga ten toes or blow it in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to spеak at this convention
Call you back
*phone and receiver encounter*

[2Pac - Verse]
Black cop
Steady stressin' Smith & Wesson's
Count my blessings, class is in session
The worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves, sweating blades, to an early grave?
Never got paid, but still we swear even the [?]
Answer that, then answer this, too
Thug's gonna get you; you know it's true
Life's a bitch, true
You besta backtrack, and try to act black
And live; not to be phony and bother-ive
But why be negative?
What's the matter, G, black cat got your tongue
Fact: track got you sprung
Now you hum (Do you feel me?)
Dum-dum-ditty, it's a meet
Attention, reach each and every brotha' on the streets
If not peace, then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the street, deceased
Looking through my high school yearbook
Reminiscing of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies, poof!
We used to have juice, but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the [?]
Lost, ghetto souls of black Comp'n

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, I got a call like from my dugle one on one
Said they killed his only son 'cause of insufficient funds
He was savvin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talking out his head, philosphin' on what the Lord had done
He said, "K. Dot, can you pray for me?"
"It's been a fucked up day for me! I know that you anointed. Show me how to overcome!"
He was lookin' for some culture, hopin' I could bring him closer
[?] spiritual; my spirit do know better, but I told 'em
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody getting killed"

[Refrain 1]
Tell me what you do for love
Loyalty and passion of all the memories collected
Moments you could never touch

[Verse 3]
I'd wait in front of murderers' spot and watch 'em his block
I'd catch a nigga leavin' service, cause service is all I got
I'd chip a nigga ten toes or blow it in his lap
Brought myself to the court like "Bitch, I did that"
He say, "Black Power [?] babies get killed by cowards" (Ayiii)
If you can keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it'll be bodies in an hour
Ghetto bourby on the street, paramedics on the dial

[Refrain 2]
Let somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman, touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga ten toes or blow it in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back!
*phone and receiver encounter*



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Two emcees, that's all we need
This a freestyle off of the top, proceed
I come from the West
You know I gotta get 'em
Flow sicker than cancer in Manchester
Yes-ugh
As we rock from off the top
You know I got the sure shot
I make it hot
I go from Compton to Watts to the suburb-ian-ghettos
If you want to see me everybody say hello!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yo!, give me that motherfucking mic back
Tryna battle
I'll put your little ass in the saddle
How you don't see before
You can't see me
Never better emcee that's fucking shorter than me

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yo, yo
I'm-ma use that mic
I'm-ma do that right
I'm-ma spit this all day and all night
Anybody wanna come under pressure?
Anybody wanna see God(?)-bless ya
I love ya 'fro, you got the head of the future
Rocky, good kid, mad city (good kid, M.A.A.D. City)
I was there-ah
Now I had to switch it up and get the braids
Now I had to come through
Flow sicker than AIDS
I gotta get paid, I gotta get laid
I gotta come true, gotta be real
I gotta be proof, gotta be you
Gotta be us and gotta be due

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Step up, emcee
If you want time right now
Come right now
And shine! (x6)

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Hold up!
I gotta leave y'all with at least a few bars
It's not about the women, the money, stars, and cars
It's not about the clothes, the hoes
Know who we are
It's all about the mentality
Love making chords
Your life makes you bruised and battered
But that don't matter
If you wanna know
Fuck all that chitter-chatter
Do your thing, let 'em sing
Let the gun-boy reign
Bite the sound, I just came and blazed
What's up!



[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I was raised in these streets boy you can't tell me nothing
Hop out the Crown Vic' with the fo' fo' dumping
My mama said I need help my cheese slipped off my cracker
Don't bring your bitch around me, if you do I'ma crack her
The hood made me who I am so that's who I'ma be dawg
Act tough sliding the 38. to be dawg
No one hotter I got lava I pop shotties at your neckcollar
Shed down stoves to buy Prada
If rap don't work, shit, I'm back at the spot
Selling good to the fiends, selling fly to cops
Gotta watch for them raids they damage the franchise
Nowadays gotta keep the toilet on standby
You snitchin' in the hood you ain't the one to stand by
Cause you could be a target once we order this homicide
Choppers come out and all hell breaks loose
See the devil in the flesh once it's aimed at you
Shit I walk around the 'jects with eyes at the back of my head
Some niggas wanna put my lifeline in the red
I pop the pistol if it's a issue to make my hand hot
Rip the tissue, your family miss you, I make your mama cry
"Oh, that boy he gone, he ain't never gangbanged he ain't doin no wrong"
Shut the fuck up, that nigga was a killer like me
Under his belt, he had ten killers like me
Niggas pray that they can remove the sinner like me
Come through, broad day, bad bitches with me
From South Central to Queens I make them talk about me
Make sure I'm ballin' before they put the chalk around me
Till then I be on the 1-0-5 in the wind
Pistol on my lap, wanna die you can bring a friend
It's mandatory
It's mandatory, my dude, if your chain shining bright Imma blow out your fuse
Run up in your dope spot like "Nobody move!"
Kill you right after I rob you, the unwritten rule
From South Central to ATL they talk about me
Make sure I'm ballin' before they put the chalk around me
Till then I be rollin' up chronic, sippin' Hen
Flying kites to my niggas doing life in the pen
Wanna die? bring a friend, we can make this a double date
So go round the block catchin 'em chilling and hit the brake
It's mandatory, it's mandatory that's most def
Check the murder rate, over here got the most death
Obama made president, but we still peddling
We want it in white, 100 game relevant
Carry shine don't slippin' insult my intelligence
Something in the trunk like the nuts in an elephant
Came for the paper and mayhem
Come between that, think twice get your bitch ass laid down
Mandatory!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Crown Victoria need a oil change
But I’m still feeling notorious, word to Biggie's name
Capital K. Dot
Revolutionary
Black stronger than Hancock
Hand on my cock
Fucker
The Los Angeles pitbull causing the racket
Serena Williams couldn’t even seen him in tennis practice
Fuck with the man/wolf reekening your possession
I stare at the moon and then howl no question
Homie!
This is the part where you spaz out
Like if a nigga spit in yo' mouth
Or called your momma a bitch
Now that’s some ignorant shit
I’m a ignorant nigga
Think of Bernie Mac & Richard taking pictures with ya
With the brain of a million geniuses
Fuck you, with a million penises, no homo
Fucking faggot
You sucking dick and I'm laughing to the bank, Bob Saget
Give up the chips and make the life with paralyses, chaos, havoc
Boycott who evers the best, including Khaled
I pray to God you love your success cause when I have it
You’ll never get a piece, I lay careers out in the streets
If a meteorite had hit me, I be good in a week
If a alligator had bit me, I bet he'd break his teeth
It’s Mandatory
It’s Mandatory, my dude
You a square beyond squares like a rubix cube
I would probably kick your ass but my shoes are glued
To the peddle of this vehicular Porsche I move
It’s Mandatory
It’s Mandatory, bear the glory, of a warrior, warriors state out will kill you for me
One man man slaughter tell the world to record me
I don’t care if he’s 7'6, I’ll get to him shortly

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I ain’t lying, been a john since a nigga was a shorty
Young nigga smoking bub, but I’m wise like a 40
Aye rappers
You rappers are papier-mâché
Meaning I could build you up & break you down the same day
It’s Mandatory!
It’s Mandatory my nigg!
Word, sentence, paragraph, story my nigg
Fuck-niggas must fuck niggas
Cross genders
I’m psycho on the microphone
Pick up niggas
It’s Mandatory!
Now get me some more of that beat

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
Hol' Up!
I got it Ab-Soul let me go sea floor deep
I’m C4
You a fool if you don’t pick up your heat
Then Bonsoir
Bombs away nigga, bon appétit
I’m Rodney King as I endure beat after beat
Week after week, like you & him lifting weights in the streets
I do my thing and take a breather, then come again
Aiming for your temple like a preacher, as I sin
It's Mandatory!



[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh
Hey hey hey hey...hey hey hey hey
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright...

[Verse 1: Kendrick]
Hey...hey.... Kendrick Lamar
I'm feeling like a motherfucking animal, Hannibal Lecter 2012
Elected to execute every rapper than has excelled
If music you callin', then you ball it, pick up your cell
If a nigga said he could see me, bet he told you in Braille
Fucker, put you on front street and buy some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, you shoulda worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldn't bear my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swing your swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan
Make they face drop when the beat drop, I drop a rare jewel like a Martin
Fool man courage, balling like PeeWee Kirkland
Call him a Kirk Franklin, stomp 'em and leave 'em hurting
No judgement for the plaintiffs, they tried to find me guilty
Of as spitting as filthy as ODB, but I've been OD
Since '03 that's march 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like Wheat Thin musical Chuck Norris

[Hook: CurT@!n$]
I'm a maniac
Ain't no telling where they pay me at
The sky can't see where I'm aiming at
Wherever I'm at, that's where danger at
Looky here boy... I'm a maniac
Ain't no telling where they made me at
Run up in your crib, "where the paper at?"
You the nigga, fine, you better pay me that
Looky here boy...

[Verse 2: CurT@!n$]
Nigga wake up, go on and shut your face up
Get your little ship sunk, fuck it with an anchor
Go on, get your cake up, so you can step your weight up
Get your little plate crushed, fucking with a bassa
Serve niggas like waiters, straight no chaser
Scissors, Glock, shoot for that paper
Wake up, when I was 17, it was money over everything
Perfected the craft, made this a cheddar thing
Carried on the dream like Coretta King
Standing outside the door until they let us in
Niggas only hustle to get better things
Still the Feds mark us like Lady Eloise
I'm getting Starbucks, little vanilla bean
If you pull that thing, than you better squeeze
Me and K.Dot wiling in the street, Rott-
Weiler, no collar, we clear the place out
If you don't want that trouble than turn your face 'round
Lay you flat like treble, we pull the bass out
You know who definitely in the place now
Real niggas up in this bitch, we send the fake out

[Hook]

Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh
Hey hey hey hey...hey hey hey hey
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright...

[Verse 3: Chace Infinite]
I can see what your thinking', my vision is intrusive
This is pure, untapped energy in the music
Insane with the pen I'm deranged
A maniac untamed, fighting through guards in every line, it's a cage
Maniacal, mad man of the day, nobody's safe when I'm wanting
Sniping niggas like John, keep out on my hundred
You haters hunted, how lyrical you want it?
My action is irrational, whenever confronted
Yours true to the left brain, bullied my mind fully
Automatic, your filters are off killing reality
Make casualties out of these rappers, based on fallacies
Blood thirsty, ready for more murking
Reading my genius in my narratives, between first and third person
Out of the box swerving, thoughts oxygen
I'm all precise on it, a poison-tipped archer
With the conviction of a martyr
A maniac like a felon going off of their water

[Hook]

Oh oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh
Hey hey hey hey...hey hey hey hey
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright...

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Blewell jeans, Moby Dick stitching
Trigger finger itching
To trouble one of you niggas
I'm daring one of you niggas to jump
I'ma snatch you out pistol whip you
Then put you back in the trunk
Shit, I'm back in the front
The front page of the newspaper
They say I'm seeing more paper... true
But only if you knew that
I was in your house right now taking the  paper from you
Where ya safe at?
Chick is swinging on the dick like a fucking bat
And catch it all like an umpire
I'ma go hard, rims bigger than the fucking car
Baby girl say why the fuck you even got tires?
I don't know, just get inside
And never question my shit again ho
I fold dough like a notebook
I see money, you pass it up like Magic Johnson no look
Who the fuck taught you niggas how to cook
That's what I'm hearing up in your song
Beat said if you're cooking up the product and your wrist don't hurt when you do it then you're doing it wrong (fucking bidness)

Call it how it is

Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Verse 1: Future]
Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on a coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, thirty-three chains
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, that’s a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch

Don't chase no bitches

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I got a halo
I level up every time God say so
Shooter on payroll
Lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan
Ten dividends gon' grow when I say "grow"
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch
Ain't no penny that I don't touch
All my enemy bite on dust
Ain't no talkin' when it's fatal
Havin' heart, I can't tell
Half of y'all might need help
I might fall in Rodeo (bitch)
I might ball in Australia (say no more)
I might call her for real (say no more)
All the ass gon' unveil
Wind blows in the windows
And I snuck in when the vent close
She copy like 10-4
Know who we sent for
Platinum, platinum, platinum
Gotta look at self and ask what happened
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a created player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean, I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions
And put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin', it's deep (it's deep)
I done fucked so much, I can't sleep
I done fucked so much, I'm retired (swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Dave Free (swear to God)
She said she broke down when Prince died (it's alright)
Bitch, my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince)
Get your ass up and be inspired (get inspired)
You know how many bodies in the street? (how many?)
Take the mask off so you can see

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Outro: Future]
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off
Vengeance is mine, said the Lord



[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ayy, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger-fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us, we wanted one thang
Just penetratin' that throat, dawg
She choked on it like smoke, dawg
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a "69"
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
"Why you always give your ass up?
I mean, damn, these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid—this shit don't add up."
She said, "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back, I still fuck."
And that's fucked up, but she so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds 'til it go down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name ‘cause she married now

[Hook: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin' just to see if the police comin'
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was goin' back and forth with each flight
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her: "Hurry up, meet me at the room!"
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later, next thing I know
I got a text that said "I'm pregnant"
And you can almost bet she kept it
And that's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested—damn!

[Hook: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Wait, hol' up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee
Hol' up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now, I’m on my own now
I’m po-o-o-oppin'
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got o-o-o-options
Fast forward, wait, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note that’s overdue? I know

[Hook: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

[Intro: Alori Joh]
I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figure I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' Me Against the World—hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes

[Break: Kendrick Lamar]
Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce ho, bounce-bounce

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
Or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on these 26’s, I’m a vanity slave
I’m a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
I’m a Comp-town representer, a concrete back-flipper
A.K.A that nigga, don't wuwwy!
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
This is HiiiPower, since the Eddie Bauer I been popular
I’m popping now, every other hour paparazzi come
You jocking her, let her be a ho, why you stopping though?
We stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks?
Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
Seen too many of y’all getting money, know my turn coming
I don’t know why your bitch wanna fuck me
I don’t know why (Hey, wait a minute, motherfucker)
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I diddy bop and make them titties pop
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
Walking out the Fred Segal, put my girl on it
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it (Aye)
Pussy crazy, pussy crazy
You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
Man, I know I can’t tell you about the world homie
But I know I can tell you about your girl homie
Her pussy crazy, her pussy crazy, I fuck nigga, I know you hate me
I know they pay me too much of attention
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
I need me an engine that go real fast
Call it hall of fame once it haul ass
Give me tall glass, Coconut Cîroc
Please, no soda pop, I make my solo pop
Life’s a bitch, her pussy crazy
But I make that pussy pay me
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes, Wayne told me that…

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
I remember tripping, walking through the set
Like my Glock don’t think
Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you sucker niggas can’t see
I’m from Hoover man, high as Superman, shit you Lois Lane
You pussy man with the pussy game, shit, we off the chain
We popping the fortune, not the fame, shit, you backwards, man
You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes
Your broad done chose, guess she moving on, yep, we do it wrong
We fucked her homes, fucked and sent her home, marijuana strong
You know I’m gon' turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough?
My paper long, yep, you left alone, y-y-you gets no fucks
Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round
Told me Mary was a go so we passed her round and round
Your bitch texted me, wants it now so I had to knock her down
Hurt her bouncing off my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I’m done
I can be her number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy’ crazy, her pussy crazy
You fuck niggas!
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the studios
Cut off the lights
Persuasive invasion, that could cost our life
Head in the clouds but my vision alright
Looking though fog, yeah my head at the night
Audio cardio, I jog your brain
Just like I'm Kanye, they think I’m insane
Look up to God and he calling my name
How can I handle the faith and the fame

[Sang in the background throughout the song:]
Mirror see, mirror tell

[Verse 1:]
My whole life I was lucid dreaming awake
That's why all these years I couldn't find my way
Couldn't see my fate, couldn't picture my name
On a history book, after the word great
It was silly cause that's all i ever wished for
Lost in a world which I could not get before
Found myself on a full moon night
He was a werewolf, he tried to hide
Seems like he was a little bit shy
I knew it wasn't easy, but hoped and tried
To find him, to see how things go
But I was too scared to show
Forced him to unveil, although he didn't want
I put in risk our agglomerated bond
He went mad, then I lost my temper
But we were twins, new 9/11
We weren't angry, we've never been
But we were searching, and searching's a sin
And I felt like I was stupid as hell
We are the same, what did I expect?
I was an airhead and ignorant, that's all
Didn't know how to calm, this aflutter soul
Now it's me versus me, we should be amassed
But when the affray starts, there is no trust
We were afoul, why not try afresh
Amalgamation's afoot, no more this mess
Hoped it would work under these circumstances
Cause deep down there was fire, under these ashes
Just couldn't be found, I coulnd't realise
That I am the truth behind people's lies
In the aftereffect of being a stranger to me
In the aftermath of being a beast set free
Maybe I'm a hero, cause I fought my monster
Commited hubris, but I showed my luster
Maybe no hero, but who could stand this
Not knowing who are you
Not knowing whose is
The reflection in the mirror
These eyes seem known
But the whole picture makes my mind blown
That's why I'm searching to find myself
The mirror won't talk, trapped in its hell
That's why I'm searching to find who I am
The mirror can't see, what I really became
That's why I'm searching to find who's the man
Inside that mirror, behind that verse
[Verse 2:]
I watched my life happening but I don't know if I'm existing
I admitted I'm great but I don't know if I mean it
I tried to know more , what the hell was I thinking
How can I know more when I don't know if I'm living
My existence an illusion, my personality a creation
Everything around me a conscious hallucination
Lucid dreaming, or dreaming reality
Going crazy , all the way to insanity
Going schizo like the great John Nash
Hope these voices stop 'fore I prove Riemman's
Losing worth, degrading myself
Suicide bomber, haven't snapped yet
We Kamikazes convinced, for what we believe in
So are you, cause you think, reality's what you live in
Not something you made, not something you hope for
You hope these words ain't real, but they are. I think so
I made 'em for me, or you made 'em for you
You made me to peep subconscious truth
You actually made me be part of that
Part of a world you actually made up
Ain't no truth is true, so how's reality real
Ain't no me is you, but we share the same idea
Ain't gonna stop, but I'll make a pause
Cause I'm exhausted by these solipsist thoughts[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes, I look in the mirror
And ask myself, what I'm scared of
How dare the media portray me this way? I can hear the
Crowds screaming the weirdest of chants
They all in my era or that's an error
Role model, I can't, it's like I'm a parrot
Apparently, I'm marking the dance
I seen done with the devil such a ghetto romance

[Verse 2: Lotus]
Here I go questioning everything I do, yeah
Then I found you, would this be cool?
Should I give up? Should I be through?
Thoughts keep running through my head

[Pre-Chorus: Lotus]
But something inside of me is making me believe
That I can do anything, do anything, yeah

[Chorus: Lotus]
When I look-when I look in the mirror
I see the hero inside of me
And I feel no fear, no fear, no fear
I'm flying the way I'm supposed to be
[Post-Chorus: Lotus]
Looking for a feast but we can find out
And I can see my reflection when I look in the mirror (Look in the mirror)
Looking for me, what do you see?
What do you see?

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
Take your shit, that's what I won't do (Won't do)
Out here doing what I want to (Want to)
You do what you can't
That's the difference, I'm a motherfucking man (I'm a man)
Well indite, I won't take that
Out here doing what I want to (Want to)
You do what you can (Can)
That's the difference, I'm a motherfucking man (I'm a man)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Time and time again, I find myself
Inside the cerebellum of several felons
Orion's Belt couldn't live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked
I'm next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us
Before our referral to man as my neighbors
Witness ski masks, the masses don't know
I'm packing this four and harassing your ho
[Verse 4: Lotus]
Now, I'm done searching for answers
Thinking of medicine I need to know
When it's over, will I know?
Should I hold on? Should I let go?
Sometimes it's better off unsaid

[Pre-Chorus: Lotus]
But something inside of me is making me believe
That I can do anything, do anything, yeah

[Chorus: Lotus]
When I look-when I look in the mirror
I see the hero inside of me
And I feel no fear, no fear, no fear
I'm flying the way I'm supposed to be

[Post-Chorus: Lotus]
Looking for a feast but we can find out
And I can see my reflection when I look in the mirror (Look in the mirror)
Looking for me, what do you see?
What do you see?

[Outro: Lotus]
When I look-when I look in the mirror
I see the hero inside of me

[Intro]
Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
As soon as the beat drop
Within two bars, you already said I'm hot
They savor, my fruits of labor
My flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots
God-dammit I raised the standards of the status-quo
To go against me you gotta be more than professional
You got to go extra hard like an erection with no protection
And I be fucking all these bars
We be sexing I'm a nympho
For the instrumentals, all right, I admit it
Matter of fact I got a hot date tonight, real rap
Take this and take that from the machine
Got this money up, with no caffeine
Prepare me is Kerosene struck by a bunch of lightening
You looking at me then your sight seeing
And what that means is that this human being is fly, don't try to duplicate
I'm authentic, I see you scoping my style like forensics, that is foul
Tech! Leave 'em by the benches

[Hook]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I see the future better than your computers
Apple software got the next 10 years scared I'm Fred Krueger
Rugers on my hip, terminate all intruders
Leave them dead inside the sewers
Shoulda' coulda' knew I was a murderer
Burning up the very sun, the rapture
The god is back, they said he'd come, but I came faster
I'm not an actor, if you play Denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield
The nine merely is handheld, the AK is hands on
Now the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because I'm the bomb
Inside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect
If I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check
Preach Tabernacle fetch the holy bible if I'm lying
King of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel
Because I don't need to get sidetracked, my producer name is Soundwave and he gives me beats by the batch

[Hook]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
My flow cold, like Aspen
I love to show off when I'm in that Aston
Look I act a ass, but I'm not jack
A east side nigga I can get you popped at
A hundred rounds nigga stop that
You can't make that ass sit or flip-flop back
I'm too gutta nigga top that
This is lyrical homicide, not rap
So don't get it misunderstood
Say my name on your bars, shit I'm in your hood
With 45 goons 45 shugs
Chase your ass upstairs throw you of your roof
I see you big dogs, all I hear is woof
Loud talk, no bite, you niggas is puss
I'm off that bubble kush, thinking about life
Or how to make a mill and spend it all in one night
I just might...

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
...Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite
For the top dog catalog, that means everybody
Several bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers
Damn I hate rappers, don't call me that
If you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap
I don't fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real
Eat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will
Hold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill
Four fifteens I got beat like Emmett Till
Put me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head
Tell them about the g-code, like eskimos
My arms froze, popsicle
Observing the game, I'm so official

[Intro: Taz Arnold]
Oh shit! I need that
I need that sloppy, that sloppy
Like a Chevy in quicksand
Yeah, that sloppy

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home
[Chorus: Lalah Hathway & Taz Arnold]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I know everything
I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement, their sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth
I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn’t know shit
The day I came home
[Chorus: Lalah Hathway & Taz Arnold]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said, "Kendrick, you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family's ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit
I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest in peace
Then be an advocate, tell your homies especially
To come back home"
[Part II]

[Interlude]
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money or mankind?
Tell me something, got me losing my mind, ah!

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
You make me wanna jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something, think I'm losing my mind, ah!

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I say, where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 Special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I want it, I want it, I want it-it-it-it

Progress, never digress (Never)
Your last one didn't pass the fly test (Test)
I eat rappers, no digest
Fuck a piece, I want the whole pie graph (Yeah)
Money taller than a giraffe (Tall)
Feng shui by the mic stand
Have you ever had two one-night stands? (Have you ever?)
I’m a emperor, very sinister
Somewhere smokin' on indica (Mmm)
Fox on me like Vivica (Mmm)
I pray for before meals, spiritual
Wack ace, bet a big face (Yeah)
They want my spot, they wanna switch place (Yeah)
They want the gas, wanna sip Ace (Yeah)
Baow, baow, straight to the face (Bow)
I'm takin' my lawyer the whole briefcase (Whole)
Makin' a play in the police face
They was like, "Man, he fresh"
I was like, "Go, DJ" (Go)
When they played your new shit
I was like, "No, DJ" (No)
You can go on and skip that
I buy a house and flip that

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & 2 Chainz]
(Ahh)
Fall off in this bitch, I ball off in this bitch
My commas hit the floor, you crawl off in this bitch
I threw a hundred more, you stall off in this bitch
And then I vámonos, applaud me in this bitch
C-notes, B-notes, P-notes all up in this bitch
Man, y'all not in this bitch, y'all are not familiar
Y’all are immigrants, the law not in this bitch, I
Fuck the opp, no competitor
Got into it with my bitch last night
She was right, but I had to get at her
Two popped bands and they dance on my waist
Hit the face, that’s the editor
I don't take pics on a jet, lil nigga
This shit regular, G5s all in my backyard
Sit you roody-poos in the nosebleed
Now my pockets holding big protein
Big, big protein (Protein)
I leveled up past Fab Five
Your favorite rapper Desperate Housewives
Playin’ with me get you chastised
Milk 'em all 'til I'm satisfied
They didn’t fall for it, strategize
Switch the flow 'cause they know niggas like identity theft
Oh, you got like me? (Say less)
Oh, you pop like me? (Say less)
Mask keep a nigga (In check)
Huh, swag keep a nigga (With checks)
Huh, tags on my wall (Success)
Huh, played the underdog, now flex (Now flex)

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit, and when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you," I say, "No, bitch, I said get him"
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'," she say, "What's missin'?" "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratch his head, she say, "Get back in bed," and she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, "Ooh"

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place," and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware, she don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you," she gave me the salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture, Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everythin' that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga, but she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa) Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin', I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself

[Outro: Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar]
She say, "Ooh, Daddy, ooh," Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, "Ooh," no emotion (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

My little bonita mamita hop in the Lecross and roll the window up
Inhale a smoke, recline the seat back

Just put your head down, pull that zipper down and pull that d out
Paranoid I'll quickly be out after words, we can finish after words
Well, let me break it down, we bout to do this that and the third
High in the clouds, with the birds you shy but baby you pretty don't worry

We had a first acquaintance, I knew I had to repeat it
Your reputation was famous, your number never deleted
The type of girl that live in the dark and have you in awe
I remember when you said 69 was an art
My fault you said it was your major, to me that's major
And then you had did me that favor
Whats on the playlist for tonight
I know you like to be down for whatever
Whenever, the light is not too bright
Come again and I'll bet you

A jump off that never thought would jump at the broom, boom

Youre curves is the curse ...

I know that your passion was smoking hash out astro
I didn't ask you, personal questions

And ... baby girl I loose my air, ... to show you that I'll stay right here
Yeah, beauty in the moon light glare, ... your best time to loose right here
Set the mood right with this...right here

Never go again
Never, never again, again

I ain't slept good in a very long time
Never played a trick again, gotta get mine
Preacher, preacher, money... can't see it
Gotta go out there and get it

[Hook: Bilal]
Money over love
You know how much you love the finer things
Money over love
Fast cars, diamond rings
Money over love
The best things in life ain't free
Money over love

[Verse 2: Bilal]
Exchange your time for nickels and dimes
The world don't make no sense
If ladies don't need what I got
I'm just a late night fix
Cost too much to settle down
I'd rather be alone
Chasin' the life of a rich man
Has to get my own

[Hook: Bilal]
Money over love
You know how much you love the finer things
Money over love
Fast cars, diamond rings
Money over love

[Bridge: Bilal]
Never, never again
Never

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Shucking and jiving, wastin' my time
And I say never (never) again, we'll never be friends
You can bet your bottom dollar, bet you'll never mistreat my kindness
I say (never), you can pretend
And while I defend every comma that's on this corner
You wanna sleep in designer, don't yah? (Never)
I comprehend and then I resent
The potential bein' together forever, that's what you promised for me (never)
Fuck Mr. Cupid, put that vagina on me

[Bridge: Bilal]
I don't wanna love (love)
Until I can afford to love (love)
I rock that box of credit
Automatic

[Hook: Bilal]
Money over love
You know how much you love the finer things
Money over love
Fast cars, diamond rings
Money over love
The best things in life ain't free
Money over love

This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel

[Bridge: Anna Wise]
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

K’s Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man.

Time and time again I often wonder where the time go, my daddy and my mom know
I stomp a rapper like a Kappa or beat him like a congo
Then speed off in a Bronco, OJ
Often reminisce about the old days, Hardaway/Alonzo
Back then we was wearing LA Gears with the rhinestones
Nowadays I’m coming headfirst like a rhino
I rhyme like I invented it my wordplay is unlimited
Now nigga spin my vinyl, club going apeshit

Artist you a novice I’m recording on a spaceship
And we never nodded to your sing-le, King K

I bomb on Obama if that nigga get in my way
I’m smelling some vagina, ya niggas some clitoris
Must be already dead, saying I ain’t killing it
I’m in the lead and winning it, feeling like a stunt double
I'm convinced we already in hell, pass the blunt devil
Ya talking Illuminati I’m talking eliminating
Everyone including Satan, Lord knows heaven waiting
I’m the best rapper alive!

Ohhh, ohhhh, woahhh
Uh, yeah

Yeah, uh

[Chorus 1]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:

[Refrain 1]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan—
(one two, one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 1]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
[Refrain 2]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Verse 1]
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:

[Refrain 2]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
[Chorus 2]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that—

[Verse 2]
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest?
Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say;
[Refrain 2]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 3]
The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga—

[Verse 3]
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all
It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh

[Refrain 3]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us "Billie Jean," you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 4]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga

[Spoken Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac]
"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man
Maybe I’m just another nigga”

Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call it "Another Nigga" but, it ain’t really a poem
I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that, what the ground represent?

The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That’s how I see it, my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
Right
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
Right
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...
There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?

Aight so let me ask you this then
Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?

I see myself as a natural born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin’, I took the opportunities
I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything, I realized my destiny
In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying?
I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying?
I made millions for the record companies
I made millions for these movie companies
Now I make millions for, for us

And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in "all good things come to those that stay true"
Right
You know what I’m saying?
And it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it’s no problem, you know
I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know
I’m finna go straight through

Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance
And not only me but, it goes down my family tree
You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back

Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
"We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win
And I wanna lay it all down"

In this country, a black man only have like
5 years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man, in this country
And you don’t wanna fight no more
And if you don’t believe me, you can look around
You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers

That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that
There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?

I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
For real, I don’t think America know that
I think America think we was just playing
And it’s gonna be some more playing but
It ain’t gonna be no playing
It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying?
It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen

That’s crazy, man, in my opinion
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic
And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out
Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes

Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn

I wanted to read one last thing to you
It’s actually something a good friend had wrote
Describing my world, it says:
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment
The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
But praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
And the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
Which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same"
What’s your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac? Pac?!

[Intro]
You got—you got some more moscato?

[Verse 1: Ab Soul]
Yeah, she's a mean girl, I'm a nice guy
We all know opposite attract, like a rail road, and I like
You to do anything you please when you're with me, momma
Let's head home, crack a bottle of the Sutter Homes
And hit some trees, why not?
Where your head at?
Hope it's in the gutter like mine, not where you find rats
Talking 'bout where you find ecstasy
Come on have a little bit of sex with me
Can I hit it in the morning, 'til the sun has fallen
Like a new born, baby you stallin'
You know you want all this long dick
Oh shit, might want to make you my misses like I lost it
Peek-a-boo
Lady your smile light up the room, Pikachu
You could put a nigga in a tomb (one) peek-at-you
Let's pop this cork, let me rub on your neck
'Til Victoria's secret get all wet
And Victoria's secret safe with me
Let Victoria's secret leave your legs
I know you had a hard day, baby, relax your mind
Shit, soon as Christ turned water into wine, everything was fine
[Chorus]
When things get hard to swallow, we need a bottle of Moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving, you love it
We can even do it tomorrow, just bring a bottle of Moscato
(Haha, I know we said P&P Baby)
Puts me in the mood for your loving
(But now we on something new)
You love it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Guess whose back in this motherfucka
Looking like a motherfuckin' Chi-town pimp, alright
Make my money flip, make my money flip
Make my money flip, I been in the gym all night
Came in the game with a dollar and a dream
And a AK clip with an infrared beam
I pop that trunk, make everybody scream
Put a missing punk on everybody's screen
Ain't nothing changed but the ends I'm holding
My dick is big and my nuts is swollen
I don't know if you've noticed but a nigga be rolling
With a bad bitch and the bitch be rolling
Dolphin pills and Moscato spills
Everything she need to get her thrill
No Hennessy on the bartender bill
Just good wine and a good place to chill
I feel I might get loose tonight and fuck your girlfriend
I mean I feel she might come through tonight, plus her girlfriend
In a 5-Star suite with a 5-Star freak
Slinging that dick while baby eat
On her punani, ooh mommys, look at yours bodies, I'm geeked
Having a good time
Put my pain in a mothafuckin' bottle
A chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same
If a nigga ain't got his eyes closed (eyes closed)
I know you had a hard day baby, relax your mind
Shit, soon as Christ turned water into wine everything was fine
[Chorus]
When things get hard to swallow, we need a bottle of Moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving, you love it
We can even do it tomorrow, just bring a bottle of Moscato
(Haha, I know we said P&P Baby)
Puts me in the mood for your loving
(But now we on something new)
You love it

[Bridge: Ab Soul]
I said, it's a celebration, clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp with a glass of Moscato
What up ho, what up?
I said what up ho, what up?
I said, it's a celebration, clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp with a glass of Moscato
What up ho, what up?
I said what up ho, what up?

[Outro]
Sip slow
Relaxation
That's our motto

I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin' up the flow
Gettin' my career right

Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hub City beat
87 baby 87 Cudi screamin' out "Fuck the police"
Bubble kush in the trunk, choppers in the front seat
Get your top peeled back, don't chitterchat, don't speak of me
I move low-key, I think like a double OG
Inside of an old school bumpin' oldies
So high off life, that bitch I could OD
Die twice, and come back the same nigga
Lame niggas get up out of my lane nigga
Before the big rig come through and run over your brain nigga
Me propane niggas for their dividends
Forgive you innocent, Compton all of my uncles wore Pendletons
West Coast rider, bitch I'mma ride her
'Til the wheels fall off, buy more tires
Mmm, say hello to the new prince
I'm high king behind black tint
Na'mean?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Get the fuck out of my business
Because I've been handling the fuck out of my business
Grinding got perfect attendance
Flyer than first-class and detention
Uh, been a winner since the beginning
And my records show, not even in the Guinness
What do you mean, am I finished? I'm just getting started
But you're on the sideline like Vince Lombardi
Weezy, new born baby? and it's my party
And I'm kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrarri
Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope?
Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
Open for criticism, there really isn't any room for criticism
When this shit is in I'm in deeper than your pool, so I swim in towel-less
Bitch, I be and I been ballin'
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Mmm, fuck 'em all, kill 'em all off
Send 'em off to the holy one
Put a hole in one, like miniature golf
Price on your head, and they trying to purchase
No matter the cost
Hand over the cloth
Cloth over the gun
Gun over your jaw
Bullet over your tongue
Stick my dick inside hip-hop and shorty's sprung
Every time I get a chance to come over I overcome
Over the snare drums
They say, "Who fucking with you if you the god MC?"
I tell 'em none
Get it? I tell 'em none
Catholic nor Christian, holding the book of sums
In the back of my True Religions
Never passed the bar but
I ain't got to study law
Just to judge lyrics
Mmm, I should be the judge of lyrics
Bang the gavel, give you a life sentence
[Hook]

[Intro]
How Long you been Banging?

I been banging sense 85
On the real this shit ain't no gimmick
Or no game my nigga! this hit is real live
Thruthful type shit my nigga!
You know what im saying?
On the real my nigga!
And I lost a lot of real niggas to this hit

[Verse 1: Dope Boy Esko]

Yeah...Coughs

You can smell marijuana in every corna
From South Central to Arizona
You heard the state, the murder rate
The killer cali-California
Cops get caught outside the Compton court
By cold killers like they caught Pneumonia
See the 90's was like Pulp fiction
Jerry curl juice drippin'
On 45's when we dumpin' on ya
Grew up in the slums were we glorify guns
& Gain respect by jumpin' on corners
& Dumping at you, cops just jump in action
Trigger happy but nobody's gun is smiling
When somebody's son is dying
911 that's who you dialing?
Ku Klux Klan that who you dialing?
Killers wear blue and move in silence
Hear the sirens? Scatter in disarray
My block's been hotter than dinner plates
We got beef like a foreman
You laying dormant at your wake
Real superheroes end in coffins with no capes
Me & Kendrick Top Dawg, Dogg Pound, Future rich Shit
Picture that with no Instagram, bullet to your temple
You better pray that my pistol jams
Yeah!

[Hook]
Kill kill kill, murder murder murder 8x
Killa cali you can try you can die motherfucker!
Killa cali you can try you can die motherfucker!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]

Compton Shit! Yeah! Dope Boy I fuck with you nigga!

Uh, fuck em all, kill 'em all off
Sent 'em off to the Holy One
Put a hole in one like miniature golf
You doubled your profit?
Well I see triple like Ricky Ross
Hand over the cloth, cloth over gun
Gun over your jaw, bullet over your tongue
Stick my dick inside hip hop and shorty sprung
Every time I get a chance to cum over I overcome
Over the snare drum
Say who fucking with you if you the God MC?
I tell em nun! Get it? I tell em Nun
Catholic nor a Christian, holding the book of sums
In back of my true religions
From the murder capitol niggas cap at your neighbors
And never tell you who did it
Aiming for your grill like a dentist working on British
Teeth if you speak get shot in the mouth bitches
Its like that sent shots at a crip or a blood or an Essay
Bet they coming right back....RIGHT?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Scoe]

Bitch! uh west Scoe Gotti Yeah

Gun shots wake me up from a light slumber
Another murder what I see when I open my shutters
We from the gutter no bread and butter just lead and water
Either you bite the bullet or you can die from the hunger
The sun's getting lower, the corner's getting darker
Guns getting loaded to slaughter our sons and daughters
Its time to get smarter cause time's getting harder
Every second the unemployment line is getting longer
Baby crying and mama she don't know what to do!
I know it's tragic but in the projects its nothing new
I'm just kicking it luxury cliquing it
Watching the news the shit's fucking ridiculous
Roll a cigar cup full of codeine
Cash in a rubber band pistol in my other hand
Killa cali this the realist state most expensive real estate
Benz with the dealer plates !

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Game]
Starin’ at Marilyn Monroe’s silhouette
While smokin’ my first cigarette
Listenin’ to Marvin ask his father about his death
How you shoot a nigga out, then shoot a nigga out?
Dead bodies in my dreams, Bob Marley on my couch
Pass me the blunt, he was smokin’ when he died
You really think Elvis Presley committed suicide?
I don’t, it’s either kill or you be killed
Ten pints of blood per human, ain’t no refills
One thing about us humans, nigga, we kill
Turkeys, chickens, pigs, each other, fuck us, we will
Take a life, lethal injection or free will
Tookie got murdered by the pigs, fuck did he kill?
That ain’t none of my business, though
But I’m the type of motherfucker make it his business, so
Open the book and turn that page
It reads Arthur Ashe died from AIDS, no
That’s murder, nigga

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Murder
Gunfire, death is so quiet, ask why, tell ‘em it’s
Murder
The sun rise then hide by grey skies, that cry sounds like
Murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder

[Verse 2: Game]
Malcolm X standing on that stage
It was staged for him to see that gauge
Murder, nigga
Doctor King outside that room
Who knew that he would die that soon?
That’s murder, nigga
JFK sittin’ in that drop
He waved goodbye, then they blew off his top
It’s murder, nigga
Diddy seen Big, and Suge watched Pac
They both was ridin’ passenger when they got shot, it’s murder
Who the fuck killed Michael Jackson, his physician?
He died slow in his music, you ain’t really listen
Now his daughter gettin’ slapped by his sister
And that’s probably gon’ kill they mama
So I’m sorry Ms. Jackson, I’m sorry Ms. Houston, sissy
Might shed a tear but ain’t no sissy
‘Cause Whitney’s sill with me
And her death kinda hurt a nigga
So let’s get back to talkin’ ‘bout murder, nigga
John Lennon got shot in the back
And Paul McCartney couldn’t do shit ‘bout that
‘Cause it was murder, nigga
Listen, this ain’t about you and me
It’s about Trayvon Martin and Huey P
And how they shot down Sam Cooke
Twelve years of school and it ain’t in one damn book
Lee Harvey Oswald ‘bout to serve a sentence
From the crowd comes a revolver
That’s murder, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Gaspin’ for air, niggas cling on
Tryin’ to fight the inevitable, sing on
You hear that fat lady warmin’ up?
The end came without a warning, huh?
Them niggas real with them rags on
Niggas get killed ‘bout them flags, homes
The Game told you what the play was
So it don’t matter what you say, cuz
Say Blood, these niggas livin’ what they die by
You out here playin’ while these niggas doin’ drive-bys
If murder was the case that they gave Snoop
Then how the fuck you thinking they gon’ save you?
Them niggas played you, you doin’ stand up
You a comedian there, boy, put your hands up
Don’t turn this to a 1-8-7
I have you leanin’ on the stairway to Heaven
Spittin’ blood, these are tales from the hood
Suicide sound quicker, but a murder sounds good
Wish a motherfucker would try to play me like a toy
You get a bullet in your motherfuckin’ head, homeboy
The people sayin’ that a drug overdose killed Hendrix
They bullshitted, it was murder
Or a plane crash killed Otis Redding
That’s how they said it, but it was murder
The cops kill us at alarming rates
They point they guns at the ones they hate (niggas)
If Bin Laden brought the World Trade down
Then how the fuck did he die just now?
Murder, murder (Murder, murder, kill, kill)
(They killin’ motherfuckers still)
(And I’m just tellin’ y’all the real)
(Nigga, murder, murder, murder
(Nigga, kill, kill, kill, for real)

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yo, if you could see what I was thinking --
You'd probably see a boat floating in my quotes
Fluid like sewer drain, too insane --
Like everything Edgar Allan Poe wrote
Call the Olympics, I can't even spit it -- I pole-vault
And your team's like making love for the slowpokes
Here we go though -- Soul got a blunt rolled up
Chocolate Thai got me right, yeah I Cocoa Puff --
Time to time? Shit, I'm high all day
Like the sun, you could catch me in the sky all day
Money like pre-algebra -- multiply all day
My style cayenne pepper so I spit like Dylan
Whenever the mic gone --
Got sick and tired of asking for shit to write on
Now the only pen that I grip --
Exists in my cerebral cortex
The future is like a quartet -- I fore-see it bitch

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
You know I'd really hate to murder you rappers -- (really though)
I wish I never heard of you rappers -- (really though)
Shit's whack man you need more practice -- (really though)
So go practice --
Go practice
[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Shit -- my impact is flammable gaseous in a room full of lit matches
Rumor has it I'm hazardous --
Rap Lazarus, the hip hop Jesus of Nazareth
Polaroid couldn't capture this
I'm candidating like an activist, back to this
I'm profound, you niggas lost like Angeles
I'm fierce like a wildebeest --
Built like a million-piece puzzle
Put together by hustle, who wanna scuffle?
We laugh to the bank and you chuckle -- keep the change
My genetic makeup's too different to be the same as y'all
Like sending instant messages when I aim at y'all --
I'm hitting you up
Like graffiti on the wall, hope you get what you ask for
As for Ab-Soul, I'm a asshole -- that's all
Shut them down like Ctrl - Alt - Delete, capisce?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Mind-boggling, word gargling word-ologist
What you hollerin'?
I got enough spit to form my very own island, my friend
Wanna take a swim?
Step into the booth, you'll probably need a bathing suit
Skinny-dipping, my thoughts inside a pool of sharks do
You hesitate to test the waters of a fish tank
You first-timer -- You need more than one-liners
Your color scheme is undone, all you have is the primer
Paint pictures like art designers --
Architect when I often draw the tech
Then put your carcass over your set when the words eject
Celibacy flow --
Really don't matter the sex, just letting you know --
Women could get it quicker like chlamydia nigga
Disease-infested, please consider --
The piece of her comprehension inside my jurisdiction
And you can't deliver
[Verse 4: Punch]
If you could see my thoughts I recollect in the booth --
Self genocide rhyme, hang yourself from the noose --
To spit iodine from a spectator's view
Punch is off his rocker, locked in Davy Jones' locker
Un-controllable urge to splurge on the verse
Baptize them with the words, shall return as the first
Born immaculate birth, dog, cuz what I'm worth --
Is the earth's first garden and that's only when I'm starvin' nigga
Yeah...I'ma stop right there
K-Dot, Ab-Soul, Punch
Murder you rappersAs my mind drift and then split
Like the middle of a spliff, I begin to catapult off
The cliff of the unknown
I got a feeling in my funny bone that we're not the same
Just antonyms of another age
My soul flock with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a gold D
Haha LMFAO
I hate y'all but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter is a brain phantom
See my vision, or my vision'll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so, you copping fitted caps
I'm about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it, and I play football with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius, I interact with the inner city villains
That enters your system like a computer hack
Then give you dap[Dr. Dre]
I don't think they heard you why don't you tell them what your name is
[Kendrick Lamar] {Chorus}
I said my name is Kendrick, Lamar
Nigga my name is Kendrick, Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick, Lamar
[Verse 1]
I can tell you what it is
I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot
My mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck a stage name
That's the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify with in this business
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
Weighing my options pick up a bible or strap
I never kill'd a man
Never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
Put Smokey on my back
Y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna find some dreams y'all want me to follow trends

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
My people don't love me
Why we hate each other?
Why we kill our brothers, why we hurt our mothers?
My people don't love me
We can love one another
We should stick together because we're all we got
My people don't love me
Why we ride on another, need to love one another
We all we got
My people don't love me
I said we all we got, I swear to God dog we all we got
My people don't love me

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
This whole world's spillin' senseless killing
Universe beyond evil, one topic to serve
Be my black people, we be missing the point like Shaq's freethrow
Sean Taylor, life gone because of haters
A nigga he known tried home invasion, went wrong
Bullet penetrated his leg, femur bone
Days later, wake arrangements, flowers to be catered
That was so impatient, take him from the next man
Cause he ain't got the will to hustle like he can
Niggas would rather steal than think of a righteous plan
To get residuals, kill for dividends
This life is critical, we living in a time where
9-year olds tote 9's
Turn 10, it's Mac 10's and coke lines
I wonder why successful black man gotta die from a black man

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Can't be a positive black role model
Leading the future with no haters to follow
Now that's fucked up, if I ever wanna see
Success, I gotta see death? Be famous for what?
He aiming for higher learning, you aiming to shoot him down
He flying straight, you wanna u-turn him
You burn your brother's bridges
His accomplishments making way for your children
Still you don't compliment, inconsiderate black pride
No never been, never win, gotta lose
That's the slope that's for the black heritage
We play the fool better than comedians
Disobediant dude no respect, ethics
I refuse to be a statistic
But changing my community don't seem realistic
Show me an African American doing right
I'll show you one that will kill his ass tonight

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
We stuck together back in slavery days
Martin and Malcolm them dudes paved the way
The bullshit we doing, I know they're turning over in their graves
The shit need to stop today
Yeah the die for the cause, some like Jesus for us
To become better people, think about it
We used to run from the KKK
But now we running from our brothers that be holding them k's
Man, never thought there'd be days like this
Can't trust your homies that you're hanging with
Damn shame, why you kill a nigga over a chain
When you could get up on your hustle and get the same thing
United we stand tall, divided we all fall
Let's leave this bullshit behind y'all
On the real, the envy and the hate need to stop
Black people we all we got

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we

[Outro: Jay Rock]
Y'all better wake up and smell the coffee
We all we got man
It's black on black killing each other man it needs to stop
Real talk
Black people need to smarten up
We all we got

[Intro: DJ Drama]
I guess you could say, "It's not easy"
I guess you could say, "You live and learn"
I want y'all to all 'em, "I paid my dues"
And when it's all said and done, I did it my way

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ohhhhhh
As the city lights up the night I feel soooo good 'cause I did it my way
And I knowwww that I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold
And I feel so good 'cause I did it my way

[Verse 1: Common]
Nights bright like Vegas
The life of girls and gold is so contagious
I been cold
Took the C-O double M road
Hangin' out the windows
Reachin' for the world as the wind blows
The crescendo of my career loud in your ear, ear
I'm proud to be here, now that we here
This year, you could find me at The Cosmopolitan
Holdin' bottles, never bottled in
Prob'ly with Chicagoans
And there's black girls modellin', lookin' for a followin'
Attitude is tolerant, I'm married to the game like Solomon
These rings represent the dreams we got from the old folk
Yearnin' for The Gold Coast
My soul spoke things that was necessary
Found forever in ways that are legendary
And through the drama, I stuck to my commentary
Now that everyday man say that Comm is every-where
[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ohhhhhh
As the city lights up the night I feel soooo good 'cause I did it my way
And I knowwww that I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold
And I feel so good 'cause I did it my way

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to dream of risin' now I see it clearer
How surprising, I'm admiring that mirror
I'm inspiring the finer things in life
And your time is slowly expiring, you're crying me a river
That's ironic because she have a river as well
I like to swim in it like Olympians, Y-S-L
And some Timberlands, high as hell
A ceilin' is an understatement, I burn through it, prove it's a fire drill
Fire hoes, bad bitches fire hoes
Fire then re-hire hoes
Her entire crew is tired of the liars that you runnin by her
I can see you, hoe
Plenty priors of a fuck nigga, nigga, I suppose
I can fly her, put her in attire of designer clothes
Dayton wires on the Chevy, why are you not tolerable?
Don't you know they already fuck me, I'm a made man
Maids in the mansion, clean 'em up out here

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ohhhhhh
As the city lights up the night I feel soooo good 'cause I did it my way
And I knowwww that I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold
And I feel so good 'cause I did it my way
[Outro: DJ Drama & Lloyd]

Good 'cause I did it my way

Drama
And I feel so good 'cause I did it my way[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity, animosity
High philosophy, hyper prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder here
Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this feeling and then I embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations won't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now, tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing song and I can unite the you that I love
You that I like, look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the installation
This that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you gon' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones
This that life beyond your own life, this ain't physical for mankind
This that out-of-body experience, no coincidence you been died
Bitch, you're dead!
[Break: Thundercat]

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me
Say you will never ever catch me
Say you will never ever

[Intro]
Change is coming, change is here

[Verse 1]
Holla if you hear me
In the memory of 2Pac sincerely
Been a G, since standing four feet on the monkey bars
Steal a nigga's box like it was ours
Cars roll up, Nah we don't fold up
We just hold up our guns like championship cigars
Mama hold the porch sipping OE out of a straw
I remember it all, them early Compton days
Shit, I put my all in them high school hallways
Montgomery never saw the dime bags
Finshed my work, finished a sale right before class was over
Now what's over I'm old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage
Never came in the truck no more, we back seat
Times is rough, the only time your pledge your allegiance
If you're shot in the heart bleeding
Ouch

[Verse 2]
It's gutter when the sun come up
When the sun go down
Nothing but tears, no onions
Under the ungodly functions, 187s and robbery will come
Don't go looking for it
Don't look like you hard
You're better off looking foreign, I'm warnin' ya
Before that warm temperature warmin' up
Your blood temperature, that corner filled with coroners
The neighbors is listeners
I'm the future of the new west for you visitors
Never mind them other niggas
I'm talkin' in particular
Just cause you got the flu don't mean you're sick enough
I'm igloo cold with it
If California snows then I did it
The 21st of June I'll make a blizzard
The OG aim they guns at the moon
Bullets break through the atmosphere
Fear no man but God, the God of rap is here
And I can see you scared (whew)

[Verse 3]
Real gangsters either dead or in jail
And you don't look like a zombie and I don't see no cells
I sink niggas blackships, he won't sail
And his album really ain't shit, he won't sell
And I had that mind state since twelve
No skates on my feet just running the turf for life like football cleats
5 hours asleep, nigga you do the math
That's 19 hours lost, I got insomnia bad
But, I can't complain or happen to think it too much, came passion Albert Einstien gained
Had to hold my stomach for hunger pains over looking ?
This business got too many villians
Superman is back
The cape ain't red, it's black
That's a trench coat
And the note for your information if we was dead this recarnation
Watch your heads

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Money over bitches why you bullshiting nigga
Listen pull up in something with the roof missing
You dissing four-five that'll leave your roof missing
Who tripping true spitting cadillac coupe dipping
Crew whippin wit yo bitch present this is new pimpin
Roll up get a cup only Hennessy sippin
West Coast jumpin like a low-low
Three-wheelin we feelin
Like the New Dynasty dominating the Nation

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Pamona pimpin when im sippin that hard liquor
Hit the studio with mo cuts than a cold sensor
Nigga what, im a west coast predator
Pteradactyl when i sink my teeth in the beat
Got a lock like Armostol? shakles around her feet
Glock in my right palm got my strong arm steady like kwali
Make it hard for you to get by the silencer is so serene
Sound like a california ocean breeze, no lie

[Verse 3: Jay Rock & *Kendrick Lamar*]
So high really though put hoes on video
Run trains like blue lines on Subways
While you save em like coupons we throw away
Extra large Magnum wrappers
*We them nasty rappers*
We them Magnum blasters
*Say hello to the pastor*
Coughin' up a loogie when I'm walking past your casket
See I don't give a shit about my enemies
Feel the same way about a bitch

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Speaking of a bitch these hoes is no joke
Tell a story any chance they get
Where my money at? She talking bout she broke
Now I can dig in her left pocket
Dig in her right pocket, dig in her back pocket
Pull money out of all three and still swear up and down that she don't got it
Bitch, you must think I'm [?] the fool
You better hop up on the track and put that pussy to use
Now, I oughta go upside your motherfucking wig
But you lucky your little boy called the police on me the last time I hit you
In front of yo' kid



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm lookin' at the flashy lights and wonder - the price and number
Enticed by the glamorous ice, I wanna
Unite with the Hollywood twice, my concert, 'll look like yours
And I wanted more than I could ever imagine even a kicked-down door
So you can hear that I'm rapping, see, I can hear "encore"
Struck by the fame bug, been fightin' the same drug
The feelin' that caned us in vain, it's tough love
Please help me, please help me
I'm on my knees, please help me, need you to tell me
Ain't nothing' bigger than you, I thought a Benz would do
But nothin' bigger than you, ain't nothin' bigger than truth
And truth be told, the totem pole
Of non-believers just made the cattle blow
But I can see ya, even when my vision's impaired
You're many moons away, but still you're right here

[Verse 2: Emeli Sandé]
You won’t find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out ’til three
You won’t ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Verse 3: Emeli Sandé]
You won’t find him tryna change the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Verse 4: Emeli Sandé]
When the money’s spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know that there’s no need for me to panic
'Cause I’ll find him, I’ll find him next to me

[Verse 5: Emeli Sandé]
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need’s a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me

[Bridge: Emeli Sandé]
When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When we’ve spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

I don't need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times
They lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and have you laying between the sheets with the eyes leased (Isleys)
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno, re-wind me back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack, y'all don't obey
Y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, modern day Issac Hayes
Theme song to Shaft, equivalent to the theme song to your career
Study my craft, you ignorant, I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay, and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucking with the music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
5 or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me, couldn't open the door

[Verse 2: Unknown rapper]
Boom! That's that, left him on his back flat
You talking like that, jack, spitting
About crack, but never been about that
I'm real with this rap, I'm just speaking the facts
Rap, but some niggas wack, talent something they lack
So gather your whole pack, I'm taking them off the map
My pockets is getting fat, their pockets, they staying flat
So imma just hollaback, they rocking their tiny J's
But niggas ain't getting paid in the spot, like they a slave
12 hours just for some change, man this shit a shame
When the feds come, who you gon' blame? But that's just
Learning the game, you niggas should do the same
They go as fast as they came, cause passing me you ain't gon' see
I go bar for bar, and b, you are just a target, b
So just call me Muhammed Ali
Easy shit be hard to do, easy for me and hard for you
I'm leaving you with the (?), pick up a broad, 'bout three or two
Life is like a puzzle but my level is some trouble, man, you gotta use your muscle, in the hood I had to tussle
Man, I'm moving to the shop, (?), man you're not
Niggas steady talking but barely looking in the spot

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so far ahead of my time, I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
I'm hardly a friend with y'all, i hate rappers, where is your artist at?
If it ain't a good picture you're draw, don't bring it to the architect
Often you arguing 'bout who got next, claiming you're running the game
Niggas are barely walking yet, hopping all over beats without studying training camp
Try studying a few greats then maybe you'll be where i'm at
Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtapes mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not switching the flow
Your flow in the same place, just don't rap; elaborate
Try to expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, i ain't saying you're wack, psyche
Like an in-voice, I'm just stating the facts, right?
(?) metaphores i write, in fact, it's been a factor
You've feared your whole life, no TV show
Don't compare me with them, that's like a shark versus Nemo,  a gorilla to a chimp, Jordan versus Kukoč
A Tony Montana with blow on his nose to a Nino

[Intro]
I remember, uhh
When my uncles
Served smokers
On Alondra
In front of our building, they was my heroes

[Chorus]

This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

[Verse 1]
Uhh, and that's scary to me
Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his P's
Nigga cue me in I'm a Peruvian drug lord
Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some keys
This is crack co-caine, I'm Kurt Co-bain
And I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-I-R-U, high you I'm a I-V
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack— STOP
I said a I-V cuz when I be in the studio, I shot
A needle in your veins, take it in vein
Or itch till your eyeballs pop
I'm cold on the cold turkey
I hate chickens but I do fuck pretty birdies
Where your girl at? Over the Pyrex, where my world at

[Chorus]
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes

[Verse 2]
Uhh, and it's scary to me
Every listener is a strawberry to me
You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
Z's on K.Dot? Uh-uh better wake up
A nightmare, I'm right there like a Siamese
-Twin, when, you mothafuckas gon' learn?
Curl up like Big Worm when I drop
Who fly? I'm a red eye with eye drops
I Big, I Pac, you Chris, I Rock
That's Pookie on New Jack head first with a cyclops
I'm the first one to do that I bet you never knew that
Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
If ain’t about me about ho it be about face
If you ain’t on higher—learning
There's soda in the pot and the fire—burning

[Chorus]
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

[Verse 3]
Uhh, and it's scary to carry
A smooth type flow like a drink of Merlot
That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track, it's a Reynold's wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap
Rapping heat, you can fall to defeat
If you don't pay ya tolls like the limbs on ya feet
I suppose this is bigger than life
This is probably everybody, Illuminati
Guess I'm the blood sacrifice of the party
I undress her like a Harley
Lights will flash, cars will crash
Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
So my bad if I put you in rehab
You are reimbursed, put it on my tab

[Chorus]
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe

[Outro]
Aw dude, you're about to fuckin' OD bro

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar]
One time, I took a swim in the Nile
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear
It made me relax when I came down
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now
Plunging away 'less my body's on top
All of these currents might cost me my life right now
When danger finds me, it follows with tides
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
She said

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Hey little buddy, where you goin'?
I'm not sure, but I know I'm still in motion
This ain't regular, I seen regular
These streams may take me out to the ocean

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket
Then I'll dive in it 'til I am exhausted and I'm type lacking
Waistline on four deep, senses on four deep
Feel like there's four me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar & Beyoncé]
One time, I took a swim in the Nile (One time, I took in a swim in the Nile; one time)
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear (I swear, I swear)
It made me relax when I came down (When I came down)
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now (Stimulated)
Plunging away 'less my body's on top (Stimulated, stimulated now; On top)
All of these currents might cost me my life right now (Right now, right now)
Where danger finds me, it follows with tides (Follows with tides; stimulated right now)
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
That's some good

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Got the Nile runnin' through my body
Look at my natural, I'm so exotic
Darker the berry, sweeter the fruit
Deeper the wounded, deeper the roots
Nubian doused in brown, I'm lounging in it
Fountain of Youth, I said I'm drowning in it

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar]
I'm in the Nile, deep in denial
I'm in the Nile, deep in denial
That's some good

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Stocks rising, fertilizing neighbourhoods with butter, butter
Black steel, no mass, no tags, gutta, gutta
Look up in the sky, no stars, helicopters hover
Grab my strap, kiss my mother, bust back duck for cover
Hit the bounty, straight hunter, main line speak ya mind
Where you from? Take ya time, bust a nigga no response
Rest a hater, respirator... no response
Green light, go time, where yo block? I know mine
So you know, one time, snitch nigga, bitch nigga
Re-up with a seven cuz that's all I can get, nigga
Small time hustler, me I'm just a governor
Of my city fuck with me juggle shots through ya jugular
Projects hold me down, A1 customers
A1 army guns, A1 predators
Pigs yellin' man down, got the law scared of us
Nigga we ain't scared of nothing, break it down, show me something

[Hook: Jay Rock & Ab-Soul]
I don't wanna have to hit you with this fo' mayne
Burn ya whole block down like propane
Over that cocaine, tryna get mo' change
If you ain't know, now you know mayne!
Slang game green rain, sleet, hail, snow
Finna take another trip to the liquor store
The fiends wanna smoke and you can get smoked cuz
These streets ain't no motherfucking joke

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Back on my bullshit, back on the blocks riffin'
Get it off re-up flippin', gettin' off his car flippin'
Model bitch think I'm trickin', oh no, no-go
W-oh no, 30 bucks, mo' mo'
What the fuck you thought this was? All I know is doin' me
Flyin' spur doin' 3, gutter lane, blowin' tree
Homie what you smokin' on? I can get it dirt cheap
I can get it for the low, hard rock or pure blow
I can show you how to whip it
Birdies given off a show, servin' quail in the kitchen
Remedy for meal tickets, dope game, real wicked
Some deals go sour, real niggas locked up
Snitched on by known cowards, OG told me that's life
Murders keep me stressed at night
My daughter keep me level-headed, reason why I sacrifice
Story of a real nigga, this is how I feel, nigga
Come between my piece of mind, get yo ass killed nigga!

[Hook: Jay Rock & Ab-Soul]
I don't wanna have to hit you with this fo' mayne

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
My momma told me tread softly, gotta keep them feds off me
Gotta keep the guards on me, I know them mothafuckas want me
Know I gotta hold it down, know I gotta run my town
Know tomorrows never promised
Know I gotta get it now, know I got a job to finish
Know I need stock to grow, know I need Lord's forgiveness
Know I've been through obstacles
Know I gotta shit on niggas, know I gotta do my thang
Knowin' that I'm knee deep, know the drama that it brings
Know I can't trust these hoes, know I can't chase these bitches
Know I gotta chase this bread, know I gotta push these Benzes
Know I gotta push these trucks, know I gotta paint these pictures
Know I gotta give it up, know you better mind your business
Know I gotta stay silent, know I can't fall for nothing
Know I know hard times, know I gotta stay humble
Know I gotta keep it gangsta, know you gotta come and get me
Know I gotta keep it pushin', know you can't fuck with me

[Hook: Jay Rock & Ab-Soul]
I don't wanna have to hit you with this fo' mayne
Burn ya whole block down like propane
Over that cocaine, tryna get mo' change

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
No make-up today, no make-up today
No make-up today, no make-up to...
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a Mac book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness, of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From heaven, is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her but when the make-up occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
No make-up today, no make-up today
No make-up today, no make-up to...
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind

[Verse 2: Alori Joh & Kendrick Lamar]
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a Mac book
Concentrating on the way my eyeliner thickens
He stand behind me and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
My complexion in a direction I've outgrown
I feel like it's not enough
I can never put on too much make-up
Yeah, I know your imperfections I be constantly stressing
From him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to
Smile at least once in a while
I hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows
It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
Is that I had a black ey- To be continued... 11

[Intro: Johnny "Guitar" Watson & Junie Morrison]
La-di-da-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (La-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that body)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, "Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, "K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy"

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
Please, no more parties in L.A. (Shake that body, party that body)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh (Shake that body, party that body)
No more parties in L.A. (Los Angeles)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh

[Intro]
W-W-W-What is it?

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a Minute Steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, "If he dies, he dies"
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon, red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dying – dead, yuugh!
[Samples]
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"You better change, ch-ch-change"
"Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah" (What is it?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand  grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Son, how come you think you be my connect?"
I said, "Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga!
Now reap what you sowed, nigga! (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession
Let's get it
[Samples]
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"You better change ch-change, ch-change, ch-change, cha-ange"
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?"
"Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?"

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
So everybody put your shades on
Poobie came to show +Love+ like +Faizon+
Every bar that I carve is amaz-on
Wack niggas can't seem to feel our play on
A lil' spice in my swag, call it Cajun
Often wonder to myself where the day's gone
Save some, save none at the same time
Talk shit, take a stand in the same rhyme
Paid homage to the struggle that's before mine
Never bad-handing nothing, therefore I grind
Outshine most niggas, call 'em all suns/sons
Steady reaching for the stars, but it's only one
Rapper, your favourite rapper, this is no +Pun+
+Big Daddy+, no +Kane+, get the job done
I'm bout to stick the whole game up with no gun
And I'mma show you how the South was won
So check it out

[Chorus: K-Dot]
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
And we don't need props, we know we the shit
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
So get them hands high
I'm yelling all my real niggas, "keep moving"
My real bitches, "keep moving"
I promise I'ma "keep moving"
If they don't, "we do it"
The best (Hip Hop)
I swear to give you nothing less, nothing less

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Uh, yeah, hot damn, here we go again
Lyrical manslaughter off you and your mans
I'm on the stage, you in the stands
I'm on the road, you at the crib just scribbling
Your best sentence was doing your bid
I'm through with you kids, like Brenda
I don't want to have to trash bin ya
When Ab enter, cats get they raps injured
Without no reason they be out the whole season
It sorta becomes a cycle like hoes bleeding
I'm at where you can't come like no semen
No homo, just admire the power
I'm so visual, give you an +Eiffel+ like +tower+
Huh, but you can never see me
Black tear compliment my black lips in the Lamborghini
Puffing a spliff big as a branch
After I spit it niggas be swimming to get to land, damn

[Chorus: K-Dot]
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
And we don't need props, we know we the shit
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
So get them hands high
I'm yelling all my real niggas, "keep moving"
My real bitches, "keep moving"
I promise I'ma "keep moving"
If they don't, "we do it"
The best (Hip Hop)
I swear to give you nothing less, nothing less

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock got flows
I'm killing 'em slow like cigarette smoke
Running Hip Hop like 'Pac in his prime
I spit murder, every bar is a crime
Look, I do it BIG like B.I
Nigga I'm the shit, I've doing this since knee high
No I'm not TIP but I stay on my T.I
These fake ass rappers steady acting like devise
I'ma live and die in Cali
What's beef? Chew through that like rallies
Got hoes, work 'em out like ballies
Do shows, flip dough like patties
I ain't just rapping, I can make it happen
Put your whole goddamn career in a casket
Lyrical homicide when I write
No bullshit, I'm Mike with the mic

[Chorus: K-Dot]
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
And we don't need props, we know we the shit
This is the part where we run Hip Hop
So get them hands high
I'm yelling all my real niggas, "keep moving"
My real bitches, "keep moving"
I promise I'ma "keep moving"
If they don't, "we do it"
The best (Hip Hop)
I swear to give you nothing less, nothing less

[Verse 4: K-Dot]
Never pledge allegiance, God given flow
I can out-preach a deacon once the words get to speaking
Give me a reason why I'm not the best breathing
They worship the ground I walk on, though I'm harder than cement
Sticking to the streets like convertible oil leaks
Portable handgun, who want to test?
I can pass out many Scantrons, fail many students
Tryna play the truest, dumber than Three Stooges
Hummers, we steady cruising like time do
Higher than a Vanilla Sky, float by you
When I'm through, I'll probably let you take it back
Like my old prom suit that I wore with the tag
Rap giant, get your little locality smashed
Money in a bag, stones be yellow as a cat
I like bitches with fat booties but never half-ass
When I'm working for certain, I'm hurting the game

[Outro: K-Dot]
I said I'm hurting her
Pooh! I couldn't help it nigga
I had to put a verse this muh'fucker
This shit classic nigga
Feel this, uh, for Hip Hop, for Hip Hop
For real Hip Hop, Hip Hop, Hip Hop

[Verse 1]
I'm willing to die doing this shit
Might even take a life for this shit
By that I mean decode their lies for this shit
And watch you cry cause your shit

Freezer got gold rims
In debt, now go dim
This is what happens
When you too focused on balance

[Chorus]
Dollars come in a bakers dozen
Like we getting bread
But I know focusing on that too much
Will get us dead

So try to understand my footprints
But at the same time, make your own blueprints
If you want it, go for it
But know it's not just money

[Verse 2]
You're worrying about how much wealth it is
So you can add to your wrist
I'm confused how mumbling can get you a car
In the future, it can only take you so far
I won't judge what you wanna do
But it's kinda talentless, it's the truth
Like Cole said, "Imma make sure the real gon' prevail."
And not the people that only worry about the sales

Those sales might not even get you a nice boat
But that cold hard cash could maybe get you a coat
You're washing yourself in this ego to cope
And you messed up like you just dropped the soap

Ever since I was born in 2003
My family trying to make ends meet
Living in brick houses like Rob Zombie
And now I still don't care about where I live this week

[Chorus]
Dollars come in a bakers dozen
Like we getting bread
But I know focusing on that too much
Will get us dead

So try to understand my footprints
But at the same time, make your own blueprints
If you want it, go for it
But know it's not just money

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name in unison, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth 'cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it's a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I see myself performing there, (K.dot)
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

Not wearing two chains but I keep it true
Real niggas wit me, my real bitches too
Out for trump change, yea I gotta eat
Patience is a virtue something flawless gon' come to me
I'm rollin O.G. blow it out the roof
She eyeballin me, mackin hoes like CPUs
She know me, might saw me on TV too
Thuggin wit the homies tryna make it kickin' ghetto tunes
Out the gutter bitch, what your focus is?
Small time hustlin, now it's time to do it big
I want it all, fancy cars yea the newest shit
Came a long way ridin round on my Buick shit
Went by any means, who said it best?
Kobe Bryant mind state I'm shootin til I'm accurate
Can't stop it til I'm a couple million strong
Grinding to put my loved ones on in my zone
Not your average rapper, step inside my universe
Far from you average rappers, nothin is by the book
Welcome to Hell's Kitchen, show you just how to cook
This city is full of bishops, putting pressure on rooks
My vision so panoramic my brain on another planet
To reach it you gon' need more than a neurologist
Honestly to be honest, far from lyrical
Gifted with miracles when I rhyme it's a ritual
Spit it it hit you spiritual nigga
I'm planning my day to triumph
All I got is my word and my sword, choppa and bible
I pray, pray a nigga never get in my way
Cause that'll be the moment he make his bed and just lay
And now you see me shinin' perfect timing I'm a Top Dawg
I love this feelin' make a killing when I'm on tour
All my life surrounded by negativity, jealousy
(Through the mist of it all is what they tellin' me)
[Bridge]
(Muthafuckas can't rhyme no more, bout crimes no more)

When I was in the streets I put them numbers on the board
I robbed two niggas, put they chains in the pawn shop
Got 500 spent it all on a quarter piece
Made about 1500
Them new J's was about 200
The word got back, they know I dun it
Spent a thou' on a few new drummas
Took it to them cause I knew they was comin'
Three yards left, ran through those like first and goal
Naw I'm back burnt pistol close like "who got the dough?"
Yea, DMX of the projects
Skinny black nigga with a complex fuck your pyrex
Robbin everything no patience for the nonsense
Professor X with a tec get your mind hit
They say I rap with a chip on my shoulder
Naw nigga this the wits of a soldier
Muthafucka it's Jay Rock

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
(laughs)
You got it big bro!

[Intro]
Two-door coupe, hoppin' out like Jack-in-the-Box, nigga
I'm gon' shoot if this 30's all that I got, nigga

[Verse 1]
Time's up
Got my coins up, my bars up, soon we find 'em
We gon' slide 'em, we lined 'em, straight reclined 'em
Pistol grip, I got all kinds of, I'm not your driver
Shot gon' hit him, he won't answer, I'm blowin’ ganja
So much work, they call me old school, I remind ya
That bitch you think you got is not you, where you find her?
She a kickstand, a big fan, I get behind her
Then I slid it in, I win, I win, ayy

[Refrain]
I mean that's bitch shit
Faking like you got it in your pockets, yeah, that's bitch shit
Talking to them hoes, you steady gossip, yeah, that's bitch shit
Telling on your mans so you can scram, yeah, that's bitch shit
Pull it out and acting like it jam, yeah, that's bitch shit
Hating on another nigga come-up, yeah, that's bitch shit
Staying in because you know it's summer, yeah that's bitch shit
You a bitch boy, on my mama, uh

[Verse 2]
Okay, let's get it, bitch, let's get it, woo
Got a plan, we gon' kill his man
The gun won't jam, it's on on sight
I might get life, that's on my life
The .44 fire, the goal green light
To build that price, it filled up nice
The god won't die
Okay, let's get it, bitch, let's get it, woo
See no flaws, in my purest form, bitch, I'm greedy, uh
Goyard tags, filled with hella cash, this my gimme bag
Zeroes add, we don't do no class, nigga, nine subtract, ayy

[Chorus]
Two-door coupe, hoppin' out like Jack-in-the-Box, nigga
I'm gon' shoot if this 30's all that I got, nigga
Y'all on mute, ain't no back-talk on my block, nigga
Numb numb juice to the head, fuck up the opps, nigga
Two-door coupe, hoppin' out like Jack-in-the-Box, nigga
I'm gon' shoot if this 30's all that I got, nigga
Y'all on mute, ain't no back-talk on my block, nigga
Numb numb juice to the head, fuck up the opps, nigga

[Outro]
CrasH Talk, take two

I don't need no introduction
No ad lib on my name, 100 times for nothin'
You already know
It's K.Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie [?]
Oakland and 2Pac, I'm more focused
I'm nothin' like these rap gods fumblin' over a few lines
Thinkin' they're high 'cuz their homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lyin' to you
You tellin' a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get their bars up
I bench press this rap stuff
Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my AC

[Intro: Jay Rock]
1-2, 1-2
In the place to be, Julio G
Westside Radio
Look check it out

[Verse: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock is the name
K Dot is the name
Top Dawg Entertainment is the name
I'm in it too, 20 years in the game
1580K day, 1986
You got me right here going 2008
Ain't no sleep till we get to NYC
That's the way we do it
From the West Coast, straight to you
Niggas who guard the projects, stand up
West Side certified, baby
It's West Side Radio, I'm in here
Julio G, let's go, Jay Rock

[Intro]

This is King Kendrick Lamar
Kendrick Lamar, the best rapper
Especially if you never heard music before 2010

[Verse 1]

I be the new DMC
When I'm crying up on the beat
I'm not the king of New York
I'm lying straight through my teeth
I take a bit of the meat
And I put it between a bun
And I eat it it's really fun
I go on a burger run
I'm from Compton
But I'm supposed to say Bompton
I know someone in my hood
Like "Fxck Kendrick I'll stop em"
"Soon as I get around him"
I'm going 'round and 'round
I merry go 'til I vomit
I got ears like comic
So when I'm in a cartoon
Don't laugh like I'm retarded
I got ears like a fan
And they just wave like I farted
Try'na block out the smell
Of dead bodies and homi's
When you take your last breath
You turn your drawers to a potty
I killed Jay on a song
They acted like it didn't happen
Soon as I did "Control"
Now they wanna start rapping
All these niggas is hype
But I ain't impressing Phil Jackson
Got the Brian McKnight fade
Cause my hair started napping
Crips asked me my set
I turned around and I ran
Mama keep calling me
Cause she still need her van
I got sneakers like Vans
My Vans looking like sneakers
Broke the screen on my phone
Now I can't see when you tweet us
I'm in love with Aaliyah
So me and Drake gon' relate
When twin cousins named Fist and Hand
Go blam when they see ya'
Don't talk to my old lady
I feel like Usher and Kellz
You can have Sherane
I know that her pussy smells
Compton

[Kendrick Lamar]
My turbulence put a burden on young herds
And once it's cracking it's a chain reaction
Minus Young Berg
Killing with no excellence
X-amount with no excellence
To X em out with these words
Panoramic views be tumbling out my mind
No panoramic views, bullets tumbling out no nines
Big AKs like Alicia Keys abbreviated
And nowadays, niggas stand behind em like Clive Davis
Clyde Drexler, before the hook I dribble niggas
On the stretcher. A understatement to say
That K Lamar was under pressure
Don't press your luck when you pressed for time
Cause when the press get this verse
They're sure to press rewind
A president's prayer, can't say what's in my cul de sac
Codeine, crack and codiac
Enough violence to keep the Devil smiling while we
Wyling on the corners with the ? rats
Niggas build a trap house, hope that Gotti
Don't run his trap. See the fans that tap out
That's wrestler shit. Don't rest your case
With the gaze just cause you wrestled your bitch
We catching bodies and catching fades in the hotel lobbies
Fuck the security and that's at the Ritz Carlton
My impurity is probably your best asset
Spit ass, hit your block and chrome and your address
Leave em stagnant
This is torture when I scorch ya
Or escort ya out the building with ex-convicts
And all sorts of criminal handshakes
Your man can't stick to the script
With handpaint. Poppin your lip, then poppin the clip
Then poppin your van, wait
I want the peace. But keep the piece
That I was Malcolm to your belief, wassup

[Ab-Soul]
Soul brotha, number after one
The brightest out the bunch, compare me to the sun
Skinny as a motherfucka, probably skipped lunch
Hungry with the same appetite as Big Pun
They say I'm too much, I ask how come
There's no one else with opposable thumbs with such a touch
You help a nigga once and he'll probably forget it
You help a nigga twice, you're officially his crutch
I understood this back when I was just a young lad
Couple lies and a couple lines in my notepad
My composition wasn't even competition
Now I'm dropping shit in the booth more than the pot I piss in
And might I mention
I dive in the pool of violent piranhas
You find another guy with my description
My prerogative is simply to annihilate you simply
I got fired from my job, but I gets busy
And I ain't tryin' to ask for more than I deserve
So understand when I say I need a million today
You blend in like chameleon
But I stand out, like I exited the building
Fuck yo feelings, I'm just sayin', you ain't nothin' like Ab, nigga
We're night and day like Meek Mills and Mac Miller
I'm sippin' Remy watchin' Martin droolin' over Gina
If I had the opportunity I'd turn her out, like Tina
But not like Ike, I'd take a much different approach
Roll in a river 'til she hit them high notes
No disrespect, I'm just a nut, tryin' to get some cash
You's another nigga in my way, tryin' to get some scratch
I'm tryin' to get to San Tropez, or somewhere close to that
All cause I heard Jay say it in a fuckin' rap
Now make that ass clap, I know this ain't that type of song
But I get pussy too, they only like me for conscious songs
Whatever that means, I swear I'm so aware
But I wear shades everyday, my vision gotta be impaired
Plus you would think they found me in Korea somewhere
And I'm just another nigga, like Farrakhan with curly hair
[Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
Or see me to be just a angel that's easy to please
Angled a company by a gang of niggas that squeeze
Once their marks are your tire marks, that's the fuckin' mark of the beast
I try so hard to follow God
You know, anointed oil, plant some Bibles in the front yard
Rebuke at the turmoil
My dreams of being like Jordan are spoiled
My temperature high that it boiled, 'til your homicide is good for you
I'm loyal to my feelings, I try to stay righteous and cordial
But these feelings are twenty-twos a producer, new Zoo
These gorillas they let loose at 2:45 on 245 street
Colt 45 and shoot, walkin' outside and slippin' like Kenneth Coles
On a slab of grease, body found in a pothole
Forks, white tees just to cover up his long nose
And that bitch'll hang to my knee like a dress
I confess I'm depressed
I suppose I'm more than likely infest my best in the Lima
Hop out, gun your ass down in front of your mama
I try to follow God like Bishop
But when they see that you bitcher, prepare for a ditch of
Dirt, I give you a list of families that hurt, but oh well, fuck it, that's life
And that's the color your son chose to put on tonight
So in self-respect, just know I say it's a honor
Hop out, gunnin' us down in front of your mama, uh
Like kindergartners my vision's bothered
By vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving, the speed on ya
Stampede on ya, impede on your pockets that peed on ya
Dreams of us livin' lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spinnin', established with women, dinin' and laughin'
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash
Into society, take the driver's seat, hope you're fastened
Your seat belts twice when I rolled them dice, I crap
So many times I could build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That's what my mental say, but my physical's been detached
I'm on some other shit, like fuck the government, I'm higher rankings
Where the mothership? I made the covenant that I was changin'
But my luck has been quite disgusting when reality tainted
Where the fuck you been? Left him face down like he was plankin'
In a cold world where old girl and a home boy got a motive
You could bitch, girl your tribulations, that sensation's insultin'
Got a wifey or mistress, nigga which one you indulgin'?
Regardless of who you pick
Know life's a bitch when you ain't focused, nigga[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I say thinkin' of a master plan
Motherfucker I'm a mastermind, I'm an 18 year old dollar sign
I'm a one man tragedy
I'm Columbine
I'm sharp as fuck but no porcupine
Penitentiary blade to cut yo' ass up
Good lookin hunk
Lookin for anybody thats lookin for me
Shotty look em right in the eye
What do I see
A scared nigga waitin to die
A scared nigga I even got you a suit and tie
Something suitable
Sledge hammer break down your nail cuticles
Nigga I do the unusual
Torture
Any thing is necessary in the art of war
Slam his head inside the suicidal doors
Do him like lil man off players club
Roll around to his knees rub
Shit
Im a ground hog
No Im a young hog
Hoggin up all the money from all a yall
Its funny how all yall wanna be my associates
Come around smile like that shit is appropriate
I'mma put it to your skullcap and open it
Leave it on the side with that ho you was rollin wit
Im rollin with the 9mm close to my nuts and dick
You know who you fuckin with
Im done with regular bowel movements Im on some other shit
Im a fuckin beast you a fuckin bitch
Im a fuck your bitch
Then send her back to you
Let her suck some dick then let her kiss on you
Now ain't that a bitch
That ain't right
But that’s my life
If you don’t like then we gon’ fight
Syke, you gon’ be fightin a bullet
(Pump up the volume)
(Pump up the volume)

[Verse 2]
Where the pump at
Thinking of a master plan
Mothafucker Im a master mind
Im a 18 year old dollar sign
Im a one man tragedy
Im Columbine
Shit you already know what im about
Keep the guns by the couch in the living room
Company act up we give it to them
Send it to them like emails
Let them sell his soul
Put his body on retail
If we do dirt
And you tell
We gon’ put you under dirt
He was a good person
He was down to earth but now he down to earth
Chillin with the worms and the insects his brother gon’ be next
His mother gon’ be after him kill the family tree
If they fuckin with him and that him is me
And that limb is lost on your body
Aiming at your feet probably
[Outro]
Training day
Sniper music

[Verse 1: The Game]
Back when Dot was hangin' out at Top's in the Benzo
Freestylin' to them Chronic instrumentals, no pens and pencils
I was out there Bloodin' like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals, way back when
When we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin' rentals in front of Centennial, remedial thoughts
Never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin' shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck, to dishraggin' bitches
That was hard to fuck, I came up, it was hardly luck
Just left Compton, and I ain't have to use my AK
What a day, what a day

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Back when my driver's license, was baby faced and triflin'
I made my way through crisis, I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens, I made you hate the vibrant
You can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where I've been
In '98 my problem, actin' too grown and shit
Cappin' at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
Bitch I’m well-connected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin' with Tetris if your block neglectin' your ki
Everyday I wake up with my face up to my father
Makin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
All my king is stuffin', double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my déjà vu done caught up
Bitch I'm brought up with the homies, that's on me
24/7, Kendrick revvin' these cold streets
Don't we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, "Drive by it," I raise AK
Ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I'll play
Like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe
Documentary had identities of where I'm from
Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'
Nigga that's Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy's done, BLAOW!
[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh man, you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity it's still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella

[Verse 3: The Game]
There I go, give me a minute, nigga
'Bout to hit a home run, K. Dot, grab the pennant, nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton, trap late night, Jay Leno them
Got my mom a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon of Wilmington
Now can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute
Look in my rhyme book, see murder like when I was a fan of No Limit
Ain't no gimmicks 'round here, this Compton, me, Doc and Kendrick
Chronic, good kid, my first year, 3 documentaries
Now I'm blockin' sentries, 16 Impalas
They bounce like they Iguodala
That's on my mama, niggas up and did me a solid
I put that on me, that's on me
You get a bullet fuckin' with the lil' homie
Thinkin' back then like fuck your rules, nigga this is Piru
Slide through with the Erykah Badu
West side Compton, nigga don't mind if I do
From Piru Street to my old street
Nigga this Compton, grew up on a dead end
Got an armful of dead friends
Round here Crips be sweatin' us niggas like a headband
Like what's up cuz
(Yo dawg where you from?)
No time to stop and think
Pull your strap before they do or you get shot before you blink
Straight outta Compton, 3 times I told you
The third time I said it with TDE mothafucka
I'll make you eat every letter
Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers, from the city of Impalas
When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers
My clip full, I quick pull, no more slangin' 8 balls on the corner
And all them niggas I used to freestyle with, I ate y'all on the corner
Call the coroner, niggas dead out here
Hangin' onto life by a thread out here
Them niggas wearin' all that red out here
P snapbacks on niggas heads out here
So don't you come fuckin' with the little homie
So OG they call me Tony
Montana, no French, my red bandana legit
My uncle told me before he died, "Just keep your hand on the brick"
So I did
Sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock, yes I did
Walked to Compton, hot pocket full of rocks, yes I did
Skipped class, yes I did, whooped niggas ass, yes I did
Fucked a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag, that's on Bloods
Westside, that's on Bloods, this TEC fly, that's on Bloods
You fuck with Dot, I'll let you choke on your blood
I put that...
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie[Hook]
On my momma, I'm a get money all day
All night, somethin' like 24/7, on my momma
I'm a stay fresh all day, all night, somethin' like 24/7
On my momma, I'm a pull up
Hop out with two of them Top Models
Haters gon' hate, but before the ice grill, say, 'Stop
Look at my motherfuckin' wheels'

[Verse 1]
They'll say it's bizack for the first time
Young boy rhyme like '87 Rakim, locked in my own world
No fire hydrant can water down me though
I'm a tyrant on Swizz beats, it's kind of ironic
Roll up the chronic tree, Hennessy, let's see, can you get like me?
White tee, L.A. fitted, roamin' the backstreet
Back trunk, chopper clap back at me
Girls get skeet-skeet on like Little John
BME, I don't save 'em, even with coupons
Usually I kick game like modern-day Bruce Lee
Raw heat, never paranoid when ridin' on deep-dish rims
Fly as Clark Kent, invade the black like a martian
Then say, 'Pardon me, no, pardon my arrogance
If you don't learnt else about I
Then, motherfucker, you better know this'
[Hook]

On my momma, you want to look at my wheels, huh?
On my momma, you want to know how it feel, huh?
To get like me, makin' them dollar bills, huh?
Pull up, hop out wit' my appeal, huh?
On my momma, she lookin' to pop a pill, huh?
On my momma, she lookin' to get a thrill, huh?
She want to go home, get that punani killed, huh?
Face down, ass up, she know the drill, huh?
I got a couple of soldiers ready to ride, huh?
It pop off the club, we finna leave outside, huh?
We see you duckin' and dodgin', flippin' to hide, huh?
On my momma, you play 'round and lose your life, huh?
I'm funky-fresh all night, huh?
Smokin' that chronic, high as a kite, huh?
Drinkin' that brown bottle on site, huh?
Been pimpin', baby, swear I don't lie, huh?

Look at my motherfuckin' wheels

Look at my motherfuckin' wheels
Look at my motherfuckin' wheels
You ain't got to front, homie
Look at my motherfuckin' wheels
Or look at me, look at my motherfuckin' wheels
I said, 'You ain't got to front, homie'
Look at my motherfuckin' wheels
Or look at me, look at my motherfuckin' wheels
I ain't gon' lie 'bout it

[Jay Rock]
My mind traveling through different dimensions
One of the reasons why they tripping off the rhymes that I'm kicking
Like a Sensai with a black belt, I'm that felt
Give yo ass some pretty wings
I handle Macs well
[Ab-Soul]
Arm less sergeant salute me
,Ab-Soul-Loutley
On some other shit leave the booth full of dookie
Off the head like a noogie and my life's like a movie
Play your role while I roll another doobie

[Jay Rock]
To smoke
We got 'em high catch another quote
Look in my eyes, never lie boy I'm on my toes
Like a Korean with nail polish you niggas know
Acting like you don't oh fo sho
Tell 'em soul!

[Ab-Soul]
Ha ha!
You know we out your galaxy
An astrologist couldn't find a better analogy
Actually we the last of a dying breed
Living life like its prophecy entirely word up!

[Hook]

Black Hippy
[Kendrick Lamar]
That's all I need to get busy
Turn your music to a Frisbee
Then make your bitch frisk me (come here bitch)
You be holding rifles hoping that someone will like you
Searching for a pill like the late Michael
That's dead wrong

[Schoolboy Q]
Um...Keep my heart strung
Still fucking hoes like an off drum
Sound of a kitty cat
And it's still a rap beat
How you feel on that

[Kendrick Lamar]
Well I'll sell our music and make moves in the 50 states
The irony is I'm in Compton with foreign plates
Bumping Angel Milk, homie play your part
I be coming down, you coming up short like an Asian bill

[Schoolboy Q]
Um....I think I need to get my shit together
But whatever still flyer than the weather
Feeling myself so much
I'm sharp I need more tunes to sever
And my polos made of leather cuz
[Hook]

Black Hippy

[Ab-Soul]
Killing the game oh yes I am
Bringing the pain as I am
You're just a sweet potato in the pan
Top Dawg is the label when it's written on my shoulder
Top notch on my hand, I'll be such 'till its over
Say hello to the man in demand would 'ya?
They say when you hot then the fans will come
So if I say I'm cold then that's an antonym
You can't stand it huh?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yo yo
I freak a beat like a nympho when I speak
And so a syllable is like a sex between the sheet
And you can buy your vowel if you show 'em the receipt
To prove that my bars are a hundred grand large
My futures so bright you can see it in the dark
With the blindfold on the hindsight of a blind dude
I'm not cocky I'm just confident fucking raw
Before I knew what a condom is K. Lamar[Produced by Willie B]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people
I'm inspired, so get inspired

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
And so he said "Why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours cus I don't got mine?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
Or when niggas holla, "What's up?" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you" (Sometimes)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
[Bridge: Javonte]
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And so she said "Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, "Hi, Daddy"?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even tho you get violent and put your hands on me?" (Sometimes)
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

[Bridge: Javonte]
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Outro: Lamont Carey]
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck y'all want from me?
Y'all don't want money, y'all don't want from me
Y'all wanna die in the chase of things
We all gon' die and embrace the thing
Trapped inside a burnin' church
Made it out alive, God know my worth
Raw face, Scarface
Y'all face more defeat, I know it hurts
20 of 'em, 20 on call
Got 20 in my hand, got 20 on judge
Gave 20 to my dog, got 20 on girls
That'll fuck you to— (zoom zoom zoom)
That'll fuck you then fuck you over
Take your safe, take your keys, take your Rover
Take the heart you thought you had
Speed off, rollin' up life in a taxi cab

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Opps on the radar (You're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
–takes all (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (You're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (You're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)
[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Hey hey, ready, set, go crazy
Here to finesse, you see I'm getting mines
A life hit a nigga with a lemon's limelight
But at night, we still committin' crimes, spittin' rhymes
Bought a coupe with the spinnin' rims, get inside
Bring a friend, bleedin' hands from the genocide
Clean me up, beam me up to the other side
Brothers die, 'cause 'coons turn to butterflies
They don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz
They don't wanna see me livin' on the end
Of the city in a citywide bend
Show no pity in the city full of sin
They don't wanna see me gettin' to the check
They just wanna see me swimmin' in the debt
Don't drown on ground, wait until you hear
9-1-1, freeze (zoom, zoom) dead

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Opps on the radar (You're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
–takes all (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (You're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (You're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)
[Verse 3: Yugen Blakrok]
I move like a millipede
When I flex them tendons like rubber trees
Young Millie Jackson back to the shit
Mouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory
Stack bodies, not figurines
Move beneath the surface, submarine
I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword
Look inside the brain, it's a riot in the psych ward
What you standing on the side for?
Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
Spit slick, attack is subliminal
Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister
Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal
Gotham City Streets, I'll play the *bleep*
Crushing any system, that belittles us
Antidote to every poison they administer
Switch it like time signatures
Colors in my aura tend to cover the perimeter
Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through
Hi-res lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom)
Wool over your eyes
My strength ain't nothing like my size
Blades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver
Tangle my cords like a weaver
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Opps on the radar (You're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
–takes all (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (You're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (You're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)[Intro]
Mic check Ali
The mic don't sound right

Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (Ali get it right)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot
Uhh

[Verse 1]
Tell em I got plenty arson to sell em
Heat by the fleet displaying it very seldomly
I write till I ignite my cerebellum
Close to the pen like I had 3 felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
And a corpse is just another hommy taking it's course
Of course my dream was to play in the Final Four
Till the twelfth grade came and I was only 5'4
So now I'm a graduate looking to get hired
My pops knew a security job he inquired
But ignorance is bliss, that's what I was told
I stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed
With a lot of free time which means he's vulnerable to run into a lot of crime
I wrote it in my rhymes
And when I left the porch this is what I realized
(Chorus)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?)
These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45's and gauges
That could really get outrageous

[Verse 2]
So I'm thinking to myself, what's next?
My security job only got me like 2 checks
My pops disappointed, told me I'm fuckin' up
Irresponsible and I need some growing up
I told him I would go back, knowing I wouldn't go back
Working a 9 to 5 is something I couldn't stomach
Surrounded by the violence
All the goons and the goblins
With 99 problems I still kept it 100
These streets can be rather manipulating
Especially when you're black and just turned 18
So what's a kid to do, when your fresh out of school and the negatives of the world constantly following you?
Not to mention a local henchman, copped a sheriff's part like terrorists
Osama with badges that talk arrogant
That boy 15 and he holdin' a .45
30 years apart, 30 years before he realized
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uhh
Soon as the beat drop, I bet some heat pop
On a block close to you like a relative
You sippin' Belvedere while these niggas plannin' to rob Mr. Belvedere
Yeah I'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as Martin Luther but it seems like all of my friends eventually become shooters
And niggas bangin' on you is something that you'll get used to
You can either fight back or run home and grab your ruger
Whatever you do just make sure you're willing to do it
Being too indecisive can get you killed inside your Buick
Cuz you stopped at the light, 5 minutes from midnight
With no tinted windows that nigga surely had shot through it
You tell me you listening, but you don't hear the music
Call you Billy Hoyle when turmoil was near
This is the realest right here
When I lost my very first job
My pops said why?
I said I couldn't aim for the sky
Cuz even shooters can get shot

[Outro]
(yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?)
These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45's and gauges
That could really get outrageous[Hook: Cisco & Sophie Stern]
Don't wait too long
I don't wanna wait til the moments gone
I don't wanna play that same love song
Over and over

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Started out good ended up bad
You like a pop song all stuck up in my head
Finally read the lyrics understood what they meant
When I spent all my money and my God damn rent
Now I'm tryna figure out if it was worth it
Matter of fact I know the answer, it was no bitch
Chilling on the island with my feet up on the beach
But being raised on the beach couldn't prepare me for these bitches
And these sand sharks and how they try to sink they teeth in
I'm just body surfing tryin not to hit the reef
All they wanna see a brother do is sink
But I'm a ride this shit til my shit don't stink
I'm a sing my heart out sing til I can't breathe
I'm a mean every note even if it's off key
Please go head and leave
I wouldn't wait for you so don't wait for me

[Hook]
[Verse 2: Shwayze]
If I didn't rhyme with Sony
Would you still wanna bone me
How come in the full room I can still feel lonely
My grandmama said watch out for them phonies
And them motherfuckers say it's haters tryna be your homie
And you see you on top they want a little piece of it
But they ain't getting nothin
It's going to my nieces and my cousins
I'm having babies by the dozens
Pop 'em out the oven like an Egg McMuffin
Always up to nothing
But baby you're something
Like it when you're bumping down the street in your pumpkin
Wishing it was just you and me in the moment
I'm thinking that it's summer
You're sipping the Corona and I'm humming a song that you love
And you tell me that you love it
Just then we feel the buzz and our bodies start touching
Even though I know how it ends I don't want to interrupt it

[Hook]

[2nd Hook: Cisco & Sophie Stern]
Over and over
Like a record that's broken
Over and over
Like you say that we're through
Over and over
Over and over
I came back to you
Now that it's over
Oh no
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to the story of my life, the mis-education of Kendrick
Stressin Hennesy shots throw 'em back like it's vintage
Wondering can I live where is the generosity
Something's just gotta give, tryna stay positive
My motives to be a mogul, searching for a dollar without compromising my vocals
Really I'm just a noble kid from the westside of Compton
My cousins were selling crack while we play Sonic
You niggas is nonsense
I say that you full of shit
And need a colonic or maybe the Heimlich maneuver to throw up what you consume
My shine is bright enough to make a dead flower bloom in a room full of curtains
I'm for certain that I'm certainly popping the pistol verbally
And never will I get shot, your aim is all fucked up as if your sidekick dropped
I'm nice with a... throw over and over again
You know who I do it for
Me, me

[Intro: Miguel]
Righteous, righteous
Woo!
Goddamn

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Baby let me know it’s mine
And I might put in overtime
Understanding overnight
You know tonight ain't the sober night

[Chorus: Miguel & Kendrick Lamar]
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)

I wanna fuck, yeah, I wanna fuck, yeah

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
I wanna fuck right now
In the bedroom geeked, while your clothes hang down
Chillin' all day, lovin' all night
Nice ass, and your stomach all tight
If your money ain’t right, I should be in your life
Put it down when your boyfriend know, girl
Both hands where the sun won’t show, girl
Meet you around four with the chauffeur
Keep a penny on top of my loafers
Keep a diamond on each of my tooth
I’m gettin' money like athletes
It can, it can go down in the backseat
I know all your right spots without asking, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Baby let me know it’s mine
And I might put in overtime (That’s right, yeah)
Understanding overnight
You know that I ain’t the sober type

I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck, yeah, I wanna fuck, yeah

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Girl you bangin, you dynamite
Keep an arch in your back when you do it like
Fuck with me, you be luxury day and night
Got me trickin' on everything overpriced
Can I hit it and skip all the love?
Leave your square and come chill with a thug
Girl I’m privileged, you know how the time be changin'
Know I’m hittin' it right when your core be shakin'
Why you hangin' with niggas that’s missin' payments?
Keepin' my dollars on top of dollars
Netflix and chill when it’s after hours
I should be in your room when you leave the shower
Hittin' them spots like you taught me ‘bout 'em
Girl me and you got a lot in common
I’m the one you should call when you’re done with clubbin’
Darlin' fuck all the talk, let me show you somethin'

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Baby let me know it’s mine
And I might put in overtime (That’s right, yeah)
Understanding overnight
You know that I ain't the sober type

[Chorus: Miguel & Kendrick Lamar]
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck, yeah, I wanna fuck, yeah
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)

[Verse 3: Justine Skye]
Baby let me know it’s mine
And I'ma put in overtime
That’s right, you’re understanding overnight
You know that I ain’t the sober type
Tell me what you want and I might do it
I’ve been tryna figure out your motive, yeah
Get it up, I put it down, I'ma show you how I do it
Wanna feel them lips all over me
But first I gotta know you’re into me
Ain’t tryna tease
But I’m not the kind of girl that be sleepin' around
Let me tell you how I’m feelin'
If you’re a man, be a man, I'ma give you the world
You gon' have to wait a little
You gon' have to show me that you know my love is strong
Got my heart in the middle
I gotta trust you a little
If I say I will, I’m up for thrill

[Chorus: Miguel & Kendrick Lamar]
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck, yeah, I wanna fuck, yeah
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (Right now, right now)
I wanna fuck, yeah, I wanna fuck, yeah



[Chorus]
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Talk about goals
Talk about a pen and a pad and the pad of your house
With a permanent flow
Hennessy on the floor looking at a video on the couch
And the couch is cold
And the pouch in your mama pocket got a permanent hole
And your brother pout 'cause he want food on the stove
And a pedestal with a silver spoon, and a big pool
With a big room and a closet, cause it
Hurt when you laughing at his clothes
Looking at him like he ain't shit
Forever living in that commode
Time flies and I watch it tick
Look in the mirror and I gotta take risk
Like blood on the sheet of a suicide note
Tripod then I aim it at your soul
For bright lights
Bite like a alligator when I write
Hungry, come see determination upon me
Come see the visionary in my sight
My life premeditated by ambition
Pistons from my Nikes take off
No assistance, I'm persistent
Adolf, more than I can chew with this thought

[Chorus]
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Let's talk about pressure
Let's talk about depression
Let's talk about desperate
Times
Everyday I'm guessin'
My mind, It'll never end up resting
I climb a ladder every second
I find another mountain top
Another video I watch when that video go off
I jot like Edgar Allen, matter fact a thousand
Soldiers never could war off my talents
I wanna reassure my talents
I wipe my face but never throw my towel in
I'm often prowlin'
The edge of a quantum jump in my head
I'm a monster from anywhere but Earth
And I'm 1 of 1 ever since my birth, I came for some bright lights
Bite like a bear trap when I write
Hungry, gotta chip on my shoulder
I took it off and ate it
I made it a full meal
And I'm still craving, my front teeth
I sink in the rap game
My name will attract fame
My veins got the blood of a king in it
When it pours down, now Snoop's on stage and he say
"Kendrick"

[Chorus]
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes

[Chorus]
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream

[Verse 1: Ciel Viole]
I don’t have time to die, clinging to these streets
All the lines that I've cut, all the smiles I've emptied
This is perfect, this is perfect
Her memories of me will fade with distance
All I care about is myself
I dreamed off DMT, fucked you lucidly
Can’t hear anybody else
Too many spilled drinks, precision’s gone extinct, oh no
You always fuck to forgive, but never ever give a fuck girl
I bet you love me for this night even if it’s ‘bout the pressure

[Hook: Ciel Viole]
Please, pain is all I need
I’m at your mercy, I'm at your mercy
Please, I said it's all I need
The paper birds
The paper birds
I'm at your mercy

[Verse 2: Ciel Viole]
Watch me falter, make you weak
Doesn’t need much questions, no
I knew you longer than we lived
To give a fuck about the pressure, oh no
I made a contract to help my sins
Without an apology yes
I haven’t fell on my face in so damn long
Can’t change our problems with words alone
[Hook: Ciel Viole]
Please, pain is all I need
I’m at your mercy, I'm at your mercy
Please, I said it's all I need
The paper birds
The paper birds
The paper birds
The paper birds
I'm at your mercy
The paper birds
The paper birds

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Let’s talk about the street fightin'
We liked it and never lost it
That's gun riots, drive by it with no stalkin'
That shit talkin', pissed off cause we piss poor
Mob pulls bleed see years of war
What you livin for? A couple stolen cars
White T’s, Jordan 4's, ratchet hoodrat broads
A human stash box before they start that martial law
Fuck planet Earth, we killed that turf, they want Mars
Pussy, was fat as mother love
Giving birth to Precious, hell yea I wanna fuck
She took my pacifier and tried to throw up them digits
Opened up my mouth to say she replaced them with sherm stick uh uh
She said you must be wet behind the ears, uh huh
I said I'm blessed my mama wasn’t here
Then we started vibin' and writin' melodies to the sirens
Gun smoke in the air, we stared at the horizon
Hypnotizin', and murder was the case
And every time she wake up, she’s at another wake
Her name is Compton and she need a place to stay
And said if she can live in my heart, she'd play my soul safe
Amen

[Part 1: Eminem "Airplanes, Pt. II"]
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things woulda been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind, "Marshall, you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game, there ain't no way that you'll win."
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
"You won't amount to shit – quit daydreamin', kid!
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic."
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
To the Rap Olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here, he pretends that

[Hook: Chester Bennington "In My Remains"]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Part 2: Kendrick Lamar "Bad Blood (Remix)"]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Hook: Chester Bennington "In My Remains"]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Bridge: Chester Bennington "In My Remains"]
Separate
Sifting through the wreckage, I can't concentrate
Searching for a message in that fear and pain
Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

[Outro: Chester Bennington "In My Remains"]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Intro: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
I am Killmonger
No one's perfect
But no one's worthless
We ain't deservin' of everything Heaven and Earth is
But word is, good, (This is my home)
Said no one's perfect, but no ones worth this
We ain't deservin' of everything heaven and Earth is
But word is, good (Northern California)

[Verse 1: Slimmy B & Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy, they better call a paramedic in the street

Turn on the gang
That's just somethin' that I can't do (No, I can't do)
Fall out over a bitch
That's just somethin' that I can't do (No, I can't do)
Rip every beat I get on, I was made to (I was made to)
This Glock get to growlin', somethin' like a black panther
Tryna touch a mil, fuck sayin "get yo bands up"
Fuckin' with the gang, yeah, I had to man up
One fist in the air, I ain't finna put my hands up (Gang!)
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I wish a nigga would

[Verse 2: Lul G & Kendrick Lamar]
Got shooters tappin' in, nigga for them bands, nigga
West Coast niggas; yeah, they blowin' fans, nigga
I know I'm the man, baby, bring your friends with you
Puttin' points up while you in the stands, nigga
But I be stuck in these streets, you in the background
Ever since they took my brother, gotta pack rounds
Sorry momma, two bails, took a bad route
I done got my bands up, a nigga stacked now
But we been still O.T. on that bullshit (On that bullshit)
I don't wanna have to do it, empty full clips (Empty full clips)
Why these niggas talkin' robbin', they don't do shit
High Cali niggas tapped in, we'll cook shit
Bust down on my neck, niggas reach, gettin' stretched
Rockin' with this TEC, niggas better wear a vest
Last year, I was broke, young nigga in the Crest
Now a show 20 or better, broke niggas keep the rest
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a bitch would

[Verse 3: DaBoii & Kendrick Lamar]
California nigga and I'm heavy in these streets
If you don't keep a pole how you ready when it's beef
(If you don't keep a pole)
Lil nigga think he cut, yeah, I bet the nigga freeze
If that nigga want me dead, I can't let that nigga breathe
Want me gone, sent a shot, like the real kind
These niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind
Thumbin' through a 100 racks just to kill time
They got a nigga at the edge, but I feel fine
But it come with this shit, I'm okay with it
If your man's to his last share a plate wit' 'em
One whole wood to the neck, it's an eighth in it
New baby chop, let it sing, it's a Drake nigga
A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
Why it's hard for me to smile? 'Cause I seen a lot
You ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot
If we ain't on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!
[Verse 4: Yhung T.O. & Kendrick Lamar]
And I been really tryna keep the peace
But I'm a north Vallejo nigga, and I'm heavy in the streets
I was raised by my granny and the gangsters
So at eight I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and
I don't really like to talk
I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk, nigga
Now I ride around in foreign cars
And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names
She want a dog, I'm a Great Dane
I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
They ain't wanna see me win 'cause I'm black
So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back
If you need someone to call, I'm the man for the task
You ain't standin' for the cause, meet the man in the mask[Intro]
Ayy, let me hear that ho, Jeff

[Chorus]
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear (Cardo got wings)
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)

Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy

[Verse]
Park him on the spot, park him if he say he hot
Park him while his friends watch
I am everything you not
They say shame on me, I got the underground on lock
That's what hoes say, that's what the bros say
I tell a freak bitch, "Baby, let's roleplay"
I like the kinks bitch, fuck me 'til the OJs
I mean my chain a woo-sah, I mean my game a woo-sah
I want some head in my new car, bitch, I don't care who drive by
You know I could make you famous
You know life bring changes
Shit, I changed locations soon as that big bag came in
That's a mighty fine ass you got
Thought I forgot?
I can make the play and cash it out
Thought I forgot? Whoa
[Chorus]
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear (Cardo got wings)
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)

I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)

[Verse 1]
Hi, I want to come and make peace with you
But they won't let me
No, they won't let me through
I don't mind if they a-arrest me
'Cause I'm wearing my Versace
Why can't we just put on a smile and a buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz?
We all might be sick
Whether it's at first or after a few drinks
We're gonna unite, don't think

[Pre-Chorus]
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya

Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby smoke it up 'til we're high
(Now Jump)

[Drop]
In a way, exhausting
We're problem solving
Drink 'til she's attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
Talking 'bout diplomatic
I brought my plastic
Making that peace attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS

[Hook: Lady Gaga]
Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell my mama it's bad karma, I just killed a man
Tell your honor he got to pardon me if I hide my hand
Fuck what you heard, this shit is revolutionary
Fuck what you heard, this is the last illusion, bury
Me with the nerve and ninety-five marksmen
So I can shoot this game until my trigger finger jam
I see red flag, I see blue flag
I pick a color, then make sure I don't give you a pass
You call it gang violence, you call it livin' mad
I called it life, but now I'm like, 'I fuckin' hate it bad'
And so we holler, 'Fuck what you heard
See, we been down for too long
Fuck what you heard, we been tired of doin' wrong
If you got the nerve to man up and kill a man
Then man up double time and shake that adversary's hand, bang

[Hook: Lady Gaga]
Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, this for the hatred in you
This is for that place of darkness they have placed into you
This is for the early coffins of those discriminated
Or racially profiled, I can look you in the eye
And make a vow that I'll never make another assumption
That you'll never be nothin' to me, he fin' if you did the opposite
I'll still run with pleasure
Doin' you the favour of cuttin' through the evil
Kendrick Lamar like God-lover of all people, bang

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Prepare, I descend from the East, my name is Lady Gaga
We partynauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West, my name is Kendrick Lamar
We party nauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya

[Hook: Lady Gaga]
Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high

[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it
I don't know if I can stop myself
And you're gonna pay for it
Oh, you'll never learn
I touch fire, little burn
This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
It's a heavy load, I stroll on a bumpy road
No jacket when I was cold, becomin' one with my soul
Stand toe to toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes
No weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it
You playin' with fire, burnin' you slow, hold up
I hear the whispers wishin', it's all cheap voodoo
I keep it cool to keep from goin' coo-coo
With a cal', aimin' at fake smiles and turn them upside down
Came too far for my feet to fail me
Lord, if I'm wrong you can help me now, hold up
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'?
The Devil, he busy, tryna get me everyday in every way
I won't let up, I won't shut up
You can't stop me, you won't knock me, ten-four, now copy
Live almighty, my declaration been written
In hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen

[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it
I don't know if I can stop myself
And you're gonna pay for it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance
Been dissectin' your motormouth, 'til I break down the engine
This ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman
See my opponent, then — cease your existence
Endin' our friendship, baby, I'd rather die alone
Your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?
Capture your audience with these words, boy
The holy Chapel, the tabernacle, the book of Matthew
And Jesus starin' at you, take your turn, boy
See? It's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me
See? It's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me, I never die
My pedigree apparently only to idolize
Ahead of me is only my future and idle time
Longevity, I gotta get used to makin' you mine
You tellin' me I only get used to livin' if fine
You can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I gotta get it off my chest, push words just like weight
I got to eat 'til it shows on my face
Tragedy turned to triumph, I'm tryin' just to relate
Jumpin' off of them towers, I'm takin' that leap of faith
Playin' at high stakes
Now when I speak, their pupils'll dilate
Their speakers'll vibrate
Know you feelin' the vibe, that vine couldn't relate
This next clip is long, a son of a gun, big numbers
Do the math, now cover the sum
I come from the slums, we come for the funds
Like run it, under the sun where niggas livin' their life blunted
Countin' the ones, but truthfully nothin' like hundreds
Keep it one hundred
Roadblock in front of me, Look, I'm runnin' through it
Stick and move it, sippin' that Hennessy
This my gutter fluid, nothin' to it
What we lost, we gon' make it back
Like it wasn't missin', now listen, you 'bout to pay for that

[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, you'll never learn
I touch fire, little burn
This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it

As a kid, having a mentor was vital to me. Always being there when it counted allowed me to make some of the most important decisions while growing up. So it's only right that I mentor a younger person with the same wisdom that was given to me. If it helps the next kid become a better person in life, I will forever be aware of my influence and pay it forward. I look where I'm at today and realize that most of my success is owed to the mentors that was in my life.

I sat down with President Barack Obama and shared the same views. Topics concerning the inner cities, the problem, the solutions and furthermore embracing the youth, both being aware that mentoring saves lives. Sometimes I reflect and think back, "Where would I be if I didn't had the presence of an older acquaintance telling me what's right and what’s wrong?" Telling me the pros and cons of every move I was about to make. Telling me the best way to plan success for my future. Join me in paying it forward. Support My Brother's Keeper by being a mentor in real life.

Grade A bitches treatin' me like a saint
This money doin' somethin' to my brain (my brain)

Holding onto na-na-nah
Hoping they come to life
'Cause underneath the stairs is where we
Poured our first perfect pints
Really wanna know
Hoping they come to life
'Cause right there on the stairs is where
We poured our first perfect pints

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
(It's Gucci!)
I'm in the trap saran wrappin' with the Vaseline
You know the clean lean jump like trampoline
Always vert with the skrrt, rims tangerine
I fell asleep and had a dream ridin' on M.L. King
Two pinky rings, two pints of lean
Two cups, too turnt, two hoes, one me
They were screamin', "Free Gucci", but now that Guwop's free
Blue cheese, no ranch, hunduns on me
Thirty cars deep, it's like a circus with me
Rae Sremmurd, Gucci Mane, it sounds perfect to me
Now I'm back on top like I'm 'posed to be
But I done poured so many pints that shit got old to me (Wop)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Holding onto na-na-nah
Hoping they come to life

Poured our first perfect pints

Kung Fu Kenny, look look
Who the fuck you talkin' to? You mainey (you mainey)
Salute me when I'm walkin' through, you ain't me (you ain't me)
Everything I do is with the extras (extras)
Flip me couple million for investments
And my hood love me unconditional
Your hood love you 'cause you on the instrumental though
This rap shit crazy, need the woosah
They screamin' Compton, must be two sides
R.I.P. to Shawty Lo, yeah B. Dot know I'm flexin'
VIP my barrio, 200 on the guest list
I don't like to sugarcoat or politic with yes men
I like me a boujee hoe from Normandie and Western
2017 onto bigger things (bigger things)
I got a smaller team, got a bigger ring (bigger ring)
Everybody a Crip 'til they black and blue
Everybody a Blood 'til they hemorrhaging
Ah man, Mike WiLL Made-It
Two back to back Spurs, me and Mike WiLL made it
Double park on the curb, I can drive but I'm lazy
Half a pint, whole pint, gassed up, crazy, ayy

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
In due time I'm the modern day Albert Einstein
I'm prime time like Deion
And the rest of y'all is peons
I pee on the best
Whoever you are you can step
Like a prosthetic leg
I see monsters in my head
That's why I rap with such aggression
I tear down studio sessions
Rappers scared, they walk in the booth
With a bible and a reverend
I use my mouth as a weapon
Bullets rip through your mid section
Rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat
I'm a Comptown, nigga get a casket
Go against me, that'll lead to my advantage
Because I've got to eat
And for real I'm feeling kind of famished
Hotter than the earth core, don't show me where no fan is
Show me where your fans is so they can see the real
I'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill
Me feel like me will be a legend like Will was a legend
But I'm not an actor, put that in my will
Gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what I'm stressing
She want the raw so I fed her lines like Kevin
Tell 'em I'm a werewolf, behold the 5 6 bigfoot
Lear jet overlook the country like Garth Brooks
Lyrics on point, plus I got the right hooks
Like Tommy Hearns, punchlines burn
I'm not concerned about the SoundScan
Cause most of y'all is drowning
A lifeguard that's lounging
Meaning I don't worry about none of you rappers
I'm way more live
That's evil backwards
Now with that great word play
I tend to let my words play
Like children on a Saturday
It's sad to say you're not up to par
And I don't play with mini golf and sharks
Jump inside the pool of sharks, we're biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms
Bled like Jay Rock or Big Wy
And make sure you wear a vest
Because they my family ties
Suit up
You got a three piece? I got a three piece
A MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE
He backpedaling like a DB
I'm such a Martian
Call me ET
Always behind it like I own the TP
I shit, fart, pee pee
On anybody track
Walk in the booth and drink down a fifth of Ex-Lax
Wassup
Now phone home
My nigga Punchline is on, wipe 'em down
[Verse 2: Punch]
Your boy carry that flame I am a arsonist
I spit arsenic at you niggas cartilage
Ill wip, drive by, niggas carsick
20 on the charm
VVS studded flawless
Try and reach we specialize in garbage
Taking out the trash put you underneath the tar pits
How many times I gotta tell y'all niggas the big fish in the small pond
I wail on niggas I'm vicious
No, I'm serious
Skip the birth canal and climb straight Cesarean
You niggas ain't listening
I'm not from 'round these parts
I'm nonexistent
Hit you with brake light
Leave you missing[Verse 1]
Cloud nine, where you can find me and my dime
Like Roosevelt in his prime, wait till I'm in my prime
The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion
To whom say he cool
But the irony is I can hold the bottom of an iron
With the bottom of my palm
I say so much so little, all action, no talk
Like a mime throwin' up gang signs
It's not all about punchlines, I don't do that
I'm a jaguar, you just a new cat, now move back
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
Aimin' for the top like an AR aimed at your neck
I can never digress ‘less I get demoted to death
Even then I’ll be the best still like a petty theft
I will conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings
Nipsey got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head
But still they’ll feel me cause we all ate cereal
Humped the momma friend daughter while they bump the stereo
Backflips on shoppin' carts, free lunch at the park
Watched Power Rangers after school, here we go
I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise
For no fussy-ass A&R or TEO
We ain't what you think and you think we back
But we been here for decades and I vouch for that
Open your mouth for that
Speak well like a great debater over iChat
Get your other eye cracked
I don’t rap, I Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watchin' enemies' blood pour
I came up lower middle class, not poor
So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me
I need y’all to feel me
And if you feelin' froggy to leap, then feel free
My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
By the ultimate prize I'm a get when I see your suicide
[Hook]
Too hot to handle, too dope to hold
Two dope boys, we roll deep, everybody gather your seats
We goin' to cloud nine, we comin' back in a week
And the weak good riddance
Only the strong permitted to ride and test drive
With Kendrick the Jedi
One of a kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters, I tell 'em, 'Hi', enemies, I don't tell 'em shit but puta
Click, booyah, click, click

(Intro)
I been wearing fila
All over Every day
U reckon I should be getting paid Nigga!
(Nigga)

(Verse 1)
Popping an addy right after bukkake
Nut all on your shawty n sippin that lean
N I’m poppin a bean smoking good weed
N I’m popping amphetimine
Oh god can someone save Kennedy
Playing a remedy play molly by playboi carti
I am so sorry


(Verse 2)
Been down on my luck
Like the old days
Sippin lean poppin beans lucid dreams
Listening to cordae
I’m a fucking addict I’m so dramatic
I’m The Problematic this life I lavish
I roll up (aye)
I go up (wuh)
Drop the top (yuh)
Lick the spliff roll the lick Put it between my lips n I lit the bic
Smoke the pain away
Every Friday (Friday)

(Verse 3)
Nothings gonna change
When you on top getting fame
N You made it outta the hood
So you could be good
N Yo habits on a loop
Saying pull up in the coupe
But you still on that bad shit
So you finna pull up in a casket
I don’t care if it’s for better or for worse
All I know is a famous man with wise words
Saying we all get a death we deserve
But it’s your life you can preserve
Hating tweets saying kill yourself
You laugh as you grab the pills on the shelf
They saying you ain’t the best
(ain’t the best)

(Verse 4)
I’m scared of the day that I move out
It’ll turn dark no sun Just black clouds
Stay inside just to make a good sound
After I say goodbye and give a big hug
Drove to the chemist to get my drugs
Prescription for Ritalin (Ritalin)
Thank god I’ll be taking them
Driving down to the crib
Creating a new adlib

(Bridge)
Grabbing my laptop reclining my seat
Kicking up my feet trynna make a beat
Wanna prove everybody wrong
By blowing up off a perfect song

(Verse 5)
Popping an addy to gain my powers
I’ll down a huned by the 2nd hour
Forgetting to eat and sleep
Fuck I’m still stuck on this beat
Still felt lost so I looked it the box
I needed more Ritalin
Texted a kid who was selling em
200 for a box I didn’t give a fuck

(Distorted out)
I popped about 50 more

(Chorus)
I didn’t feel well I fell to the floor
N I went down in mystery
Now no one remembers me
Jesus all this just to be stuck in history
Cause no one believed in me
(no one believed in me)

(Outro)
I overdosed because  I wanted to be the best of all



Bitch, yeah, ha

Compton most wanted, haunted by the ghost of the dead
Climbing out the casket, with a bullet in the head
All blue, all red, smothers every corner
Catch 'em while they're young like the symptoms of pneumonia
Good 'ol California, killa' California
Where the violence lives, and the peace remains homeless
Killers off the leash, at the mouth, they be foaming
Mad dog mad dog, my goonies be some mad dogs
I'm in the booth zoning
Like 28 grams, of the good yams
Fiends line up in the morning
I'm cloning, greatness
My words made of fire like I'm rhyming about satan
I could burn through some braces
If I had 'em
This is the return of the dragon
I'm not talking about, Bruce Lee
I'm talking about, true heat
And it look like you got cold feet
Step into the flame and I might rekindle your name

(laughing)

Point blank range, as I take aim, at success
Put a bullet in the brain, then one more, in the chest
I'm not thinking about no vest, that is not a factor
I rip through that like I rip through a rapper
I'm not a rapper, I am a raptor
Dinosaur climbing on, everything that I perform
Mayhem, chaos, they pray i, fall
Victim of a fight, which is a gunslinging brawl
But I'm all in all aware, that I'm rare
Like a flying saucer hovin' through the air
Kendrick don't have a spare, meaning there's
No two alike, you can bet it, and I guarantee I'm right
Like a freeway exit, I hope you get the message
Before your T-Mobile lose service
And don’t log off AIM on purpose, you nervous
Ain't you, I'm ready to spank you
Discipline the disobedient hang 'em like Willy Lynch
Don't fuck with me

I'm a furnace, burning, turn this mothafucka' inside out like
Daddy mac, mac, daddy's back with a brand new bag
And I'm talking about, mo' money pussy and pistols
Students please get out your pencils
I'm about to break down the principles of the game
Don't complain because, it could be much worse
Whenever you took an L, know that, you could be taking a hearse
Ask you first, don't trust no skirt because bitches are the biggest liars
You playing with that you playing with fire

Burn (echoes)

Straight from the belly of the beast
Break it to the police
Said he put it on me
I'm a ride til my wheels fall off with a G
Ride with the P, 89 creep
On him like a ninja, you entered the warzone
Your home Get bombed on, like an iraqi, and the policy
A guerilla warfare, that nothing is fair
We playin for keeps, no food no sleep
I'm a warrior the coroner going to have to come and get him
Put him under the streets, and I guarantee
I hit 'em where it hurts, I'm a lurk where he sleeps
His alarm clock beep, I be right there
Gun then knife, dead kids, dead wife
Dead bedrock head shot, I'm a hit him twice
Then clear out the block, until there's no mo' life there
Top dawg ENT, bitch we right here
We ain't runnin'
We be gunnin'
Niggas talk alot but they don't say nothin'
Chop 'em up, slice 'em up, he a cooked onion
Shake 'em down, break 'em down, throw 'em in a dungeon
Don't wanna brawl with 5-6 hog
I'm a beast when I bark, every skyship fall
Ground shall break, part the seas and the greatest lakes
Anarchy is taking place, turn gorillas to bathing apes
I'm a gorilla in every state
Your opinion don't mean shit mind yo business
Before I give your mind a business
Ask matadors I ain't bullshittin'
Bitches

Bleh bleh



[Intro]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
It's just been one of them weeks
Ruslan
Look, I should really be workin' on my album right now
But I couldn't help myself
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my eyes and you will soon find a greener eclipse
Tryna get though, from the get-go
You the blacks don't miss
Hey, it could feel the strangest
It could feel like you and your best friend are now becoming strangers
I can tell you that I have failed you
But you tell me I'm brainless
And I cannot change this
How can I say the scripture
When the ? for blind, it may not hit ya
Went on the road and I came back a star
Think that I made it and I am in charge
Seeing me different and thinkin' I switched
Man, this whole process is feeling bizarre
I'm just happy to be out of my script
Tell me why you think I'm different again
Taken for granted and then we'll be missed
Taken for granted, later will be missed

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the same people 'round me, now they thinkin' I'm famous
My savior saved me, my city made me
And put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's outrageous, hate this
But please shutup, let me say this

[Hook]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from three planets away
I got my Word, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm singin'
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe

[Verse 2]
I'm tryna to stay on the path, and not look on back to what we once was
You tryna churn into somethin'
Tip on that malt to get you that uuz
Feelin' the rapture
We live in a world, we live in a world
That wants to laugh at ya
We live in a world
I could be honest, I know they don't hear us
They carousel ? life continues propellin' us
Forward, they just wanna put us on the auction block but there's no way they sellin' us
Worth more than minimum wage
Forever you could relate
Any subliminal
Back in my criminal days, I would stil live in a way
That was reciprocal, this was nothin' I could change
So the Messiah was slain
Wow, what a miracle
Opened the door to be saved
Jesus opened the door for all of us to be saved

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Outro]
They ? like this
Been a long time, can't you see the Lord smiling
They waitin' on ? heart, the tank is all empty
Xs in the air, and they do it by instinct
Hide your children, hide your children
We are not better than you
Please don't put any of these rappers on a pedastal
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
We  don't wanna hear anymore of your lies
My New Year's resolution is the Kings Dream movement
Shut your whole thing down, don't you question what I'm doing
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Straight from the bottom of the gutter
Where we run from undercovers
Like a tiler who don't want to take a nap, my brother
Wavin' for a rap, my brother
I was broke, goin' half on a set, my brother
Twistin' up the purple, call it jelly roll
Incarcerated till I'm faded, let it feed my soul
Daydreamin' 'bout Keyshia Coles
Look to my left, see a rat with a snotty nose
Yeah, that's the type of shit I'm on
This is where I come from, this is where I was rose
But the floors don't got those
Just heroin needles that stick you in your shoe sole
And you can get your shoe stole
Rockin' Jordans like you important, give me those
I want the victory to picture me
I can write or recite scriptures from Timothy

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of this paper, dreams of this paper
Ridin' 'round with my middle finger up in the scraper
Middle finger up to my motherfuckin' haters
I'm so serious, but I laugh at you later, aye

[Bridge: Jay Rock]
I ain't never lie, I ain't never lie
I ain't never lie, I ain't never lie
I ain't never lie, I ain't never lie
I ain't never lie, I ain't never lie
[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Straight up, this ain't no fuckin' fluke
I got homies right now with choppers on the roof
I got bitches right now with deuces in they boots
Blades in they hair, so if they chop it up with you
That mean literally, they gone chop you up through
Shh, so don't get too comfortable
Like Wayne and Babyface, I'm a fuckin' fool
Got these streets on lock like a (?)
Watch, I'm a Monsoon, Typhon times two
Nine times out of ten I'm ridin' with the rifle
For my rivals plottin' on my arrival
Take a break, I take a AK and a smile
You take a breather, take a ounce of the reefer
Straight to the head, keep the heater, you ain't ether either
Plus, I had the scale like a libra
Weighin' up, but I'm a Aries, so I ram 'em till they buried

Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My momma is stressin', my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, 23 hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote
Hope it get you off Death Row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right, just so you...

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

[Refrain: GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya
I like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I'm 23 with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back and for that I give them my torso
You think about it; and don't call me lyrical
'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard" probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He'll probably be out of work, laid back, while he...

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

[Refrain: GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

[Outro: GLC]
Church is definitely on the move
And now we done took it up to the cathedral
'Cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
We out here rotating under the five P's
Proper preparation prevents poor performance
You know what I'm talking 'bout? Doing my thing
'Cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
From the Windy City streets all the way out here
To the streets of Compton, know what I'm talking 'bout?
Church is definitely on the move
And we gonna continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner
By the name of Kendrick Lamar, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
You gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That's the only way your pockets gonna expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yo'self
Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Exercise your ism, and don't depend on no one else
Cathedral, church, "ism"

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Look, tell me what you really wanna see
I had the greatest experience shooting that video, 'What’s it Gonna Be?'
I had to say it wowing, my heartbeat started pounding
Walked on the set while she got dressed
In cock rings on her outfit
Janet, why you doing this to me?
At the time I couldn’t believe we both were starring in this movie
You're in my video, you know a nigga loved it
I spent 2.4 million on the fucking budget
All my jewelry flooded, see how the kid was on?
First rap nigga album you’ve ever featured on
And I was weak in the Lord, despite the things we said
My first words to Hype Williams is “I can’t believe this dream”
Shot a solo scene, I tried to make mines better
But I love when we shot together, and we rubbed up on each other
But I’m a little jealous, Tip, your tongue went in her mouth
In that Poetic Justice movie, from what I can account
You know what we be ‘bout…
Any time, huh?
Any place, baby?

Now, you know, at the time, I was really
I really had my crush on shorty, man, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I was in love with shorty since she was
Penny and all that on Good Times and shit, you know what I mean?
Ayo, Kamaal, you’s a fucked up dude for doing that to me, man
You broke my heart with that, man
[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Come on, Buss, you know how many dudes say that to me? Like…
(You know you foul)
Once a day, girl, truly
We grew up with her through the lens of a camera
Didn’t have much, but dare said I’m having her
Shorty was the joint, here’s my case and point
Me and ‘Pac rollin’ L’s in the trailer
Both of us get to scheming how to nail her
First movie about to come out in the theater
Pleasure principle, butt to the makeup truck, so ill I gave her my code
We kissed, I took her control, we swapped as all the film rolled
A marathon, we kept this good thing going, sunset, the moon, it came on
In my mind it would prolong
Listen, the scene was deaded, but I wanted my own edit
Me and Justice kissing keep it going, two pros with credit
A memorable summer in ’92 out in Cali
When I got back up top my niggas asked about the fatty
And did I smash her madly, to that I had to answer
Negative, but I’d give anything to be her dancer
A captivating lady, I used to be her baby
Good Times, they never fading
Look back and celebrate Poetic Justice

[Outro: Janet Jackson]
At any time, and any place, I don’t care who’s around
At any time, and any place, I don’t care who’s around
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs[Produced by Scoop DeVille & Sounwave]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Outro Skit]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"Enough with all this talkin'."
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"

Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

(Verse)
In the thunder and rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Moving up my thigh
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips
I recognize your fragrance, hold up
You ain't never gotta say shit
And I know your taste is
A little bit, mmm high maintenance
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you the flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems and this song’s dedicated to you

(Chorus x2)
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
(Verse)
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty option plain
Cold nights when you curse this thang
You called up your girl when caught up in the ity bity rain
Heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Don’t approach her with that atari
That a good game always sorry
They say conversation ruination
I can tell
But I can’t right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real, alright

(Chorus x2)
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

(Verse)
I really know you play this
‘Cus oh boy you test my patience
With all these subjective photographs
And all these one life vacations
Love is not a verb, you should look it in a mirror
Love is not a verb, if you’re lookin for a maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
Fatal attraction is called, what we have in common is pain
(Chorus x2)
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

I only have one question for you
What did you do with all the letters I wrote you?
If you wonder what I did with yours
I read them imagining that I'm still with you

And I get intoxicated when I see another photo with him
With a little more poison with sugar, to no longer feel...
Anything
To no longer feel anything

Here in my heart
Here in my heart
Here in my heart

'Cause I'll keep waiting for you in our lake house

Try it if it feels right (try it)
Try it if it feels right, yah

[Intro]
Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker & Rapsody]
I feel your energy (feel your energy)
It's coming through (it's coming through)
Took me a century (a century)
To get next to you (to get next to you)
Plus make some enemies (enemies)
Invested in you (invest in you)
So, I feel your energy (I feel your energy)
Invested, pursue (ooo ooo, I never read the 48 Laws)

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
The power of the dussy make a grown man cry
The day I came up out my mama I saw a grown man cry
They say it has magic powers, even Magic ain’t die
Wake you up out ya sleep to take a 3am car ride
He said the booty the only thing between him and God
They love the booty, sacrifice they family and job
Badge make police feel powerful in the hood
Guns make us feel powerful but they don’t do no good
I know my blackness powerful and they don't like that
I know some niggas sold theirs, sit back and watch 'em tap dance
Bombs over Baghdad to have a flag to brag 'bout
Don't make you a big boy, 'cause you got a nice stack
Carolina home boy, you know we keep a Stackhouse
That's power when you know the game, I'm feeling like a Champ now
I went the rap route, homie get out the trap house
I want the power to be able rap 'bout what I rap 'bout
Black child
God, love and textiles
Point, blank decimal
Steph Curry projectile
I saw the goal from 8 miles
With every stone you threw I picked it up and built a powerhouse
Caught a case
I got murder in my profile
Niggas still billin’ me
See, that's just the appeal in me
Respek on my name
Why y'all niggas so emotional?
Power
[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker & Rapsody]
I feel your energy (feel your energy)
It's coming through (it's coming through)
Took me a century (a century)
To get next to you (to get next to you)
Plus make some enemies (enemies)
Invested in you (invest in you)
So, I feel your energy (I feel your energy)
Invested, pursue (ooo ooo, I never read the 48 Laws)

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Power up with the word
I got it from my God
He said a good shepherd don’t trip over what they heard
Let 'em talk the talk until the night you choose to go and purge
I came up when the rest of you struggled and failed to flourish
Conversations with florist
She said I'm good as herbs
Get 'em high, get 'em high from the hood to the suburbs
No one can take your power even if a storm occurred
It ain't man-made, but whether or not you paid don’t help or hurt
It's a perk
Jamla Squad written on my shirt
I got a lane but all the lines around me dotted, I can merge
I can do what you can but you can't do the same with words
As I, now watch my street cred go multiply
They say the streets respect the real ones
No one as real as I
It's just me and young blood, this where I get all of my power
The night I got a chain from Mr. Flowers
I gave it back when I got done rappin; the same hour
I ain't Five Percent, ‘less we talkin the top emcees
And I'm in the top of that, the rest beneath me all cowards
When it spits, look around, it’s meteor showers
I watch the stars fall, fall, fall, yeah this what you call power
[Refrain]
Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Let’s talk about power
Let's talk about yours and ours that paid the allowance
Let's talk about hundred-thousand kids ravin’ and bouncin
Cravin' and drownin in words the day I pronounce it
Let's talk about power
Let's talk about do'ers and dont'ers
The house I built when I was homeless and sleepin' in corners
Sharin’ Coronas and Black & Milds
Donuts in El Caminos
Talkin’ loud, scrapin' and combin'
Residue every mornin'
Talk about legacy
Let's talk about the life of celebrity
Verses integrity
Curse the first one that thirst for necessity
Searching for equity
Verses the earth that birthed us indefinitely
Verse the verse I wrote in jeopardy
Surfin' the laws of the universe and destiny
Church and a God is all that’s ever been ‘head of me, aw
Let's talk about my power, the golden child was
Granted to be on your cameras and store counters
He’s bananas, competitive, we can dance
See the damage, no more fo’ he peed his pants
My second LP had real niggas on POTUS lawn
My seven trophies is at my Granny's and Heaven arms
I'm in Jamaica like “wah gwaan,” my feet  is out
My hair is long and patois comin' from my mouth
Me, I go outdoors it's time to bless up erryuhn'
Rude boy, me, I ain't worry 'bout it, fearless
I shot niggas, then shot movies ten years later
Dear God, why you show me so much favor?
Amongst the haters and wickedness (wickedness)
Deliver this child from evil convictions and frivolous (frivolous)
Debates about who's the preeminent  emcee of the millennium
And it's all for the Benjamins
And I'm all of y'all nemesis
And I'm all in all happy none of y'all can fathom who Kendrick is
The only One that ever did wrote the Book of Genesis
Motherfucker, that's power
[Refrain]
Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets
And may the force that be with us forever
Be right here to guide us
Your sensitivity is very sensitive to mine

[Outro]
Hey, what up, cuz? Man
It's ya boy Crunch, man, checkin' in, man
Heard you playin' in a couple weeks, man
Holla at me when you get this message, though
Holla at me, it's important, holla at me
Oh yeah, I forget to tell you, I got a new toy
Got a brand new toy
So you know what I'm gettin' ready to do to it, baby
Turnt out that chrome on that paint, baby
That chrome comin' in June, baby
I been chicken chasin' all summer, ya dig me?
I been chasin' chicken all summer, pocket muscle
That's the new thing now, pocket muscle, a.k.a. chicken

[Verse: Harry Mack & Kendrick Lamar)
Uh, rest in peace, Prodigy
Harry Mack, visual raps, you gotta see
Uh, on New@2 and no one heard of me
Murder MCs, somebody throw a word at me (Hunnid dollas)
Yeah, I'm a lyrical scholar, every bar I spit I should get a hunnid dollars
Stack 'em up real quick, take it to the bank
Harry Mack, every lyric is dank, rappers get spanked (Water)
Yeah, one time, I'll bring 'em to the slaughter
Holler at the daughter, my flow is water
It's liquid, I'm sick, kid
I drink it out the ki-Crystal Geyser
You know that I spit flows wiser
H-Mack, I'm on it, you know I'm bout to hold it
High off off of Jade 'cause we rolled it, I told it
One time, Harry Mack, the mic I'm 'bout to slay it
He answered two out of three, so he ain't have to pay it (pen)
Ay, one time, Harry Mack, I'm in the state of Zen
Rip again and again
It's off top, I need no pen
Yo, I'm in, my zone when I'm on it
I hit 'em like a missile
I wish I had the bracelet with the crystals
But Mack ain't got money, right now I ain't paid
Every rapper gettin' slayed
I'ma make his frame decayed
One time, ayo, I cut him like surgery
Somebody throw another word at me
It's absurd how I free (Belt)
Ay, one time, my lyrics is felt
I'll make you rappers melt
'Bout to get the Cruz Show Belt
When I'm all up on it, Harry Mack, you know that I'm performing
Yeah, I'm a champion, Cruz Show every morning
Yeah, I'm 'bout to kill that
One time, I stay true
Hold it down with the best in the game and J Cruz
Yo, we out here right now
Never been down and out
Matter fact, I kick a freestyle and hit the Power House
Stage, it's Mack up in a rage
Makin' rappers disengage
We don't want no six, I'm up in the mix, with all of the tricks
Harry Mack, I holla get it done
And when I'm on the mic I just be shinin' like the sun
Hey, check it, I'm getting lifted off the marijuana
Hit the chronja and the ganja
Llama Llama Red Pajama
Yo, when I'm on it, I'ma hold it
It's Mack, yo, I'm gettin' it
Off'a the top, I'm cold flippin' it
Yeah, ay, one time, you know I get it done
I remember watchin' video for Heart Part I
My homie Brady B put me up on the game
When I watched the flow, I realized the shit was insane
After that, I saw Monster and I just knew
And before I really knew, then Kendrick had blew
Yo, 'good kid, m.A.A.d city' I was bumpin' the jam
Harry Mack, I can't believe I'm sittin' next to the man
Yeah, check it, when we do it, yo, the people have to give it up
Yo, we 'bout to take a couple shots up out the Dixie cup
Yeah, one time, I rest 'em with flames
I'm sayin' RIP Prodigy one of the best in the game
It's Harry Mack, yo



[Intro: Rick Ross]
If Michael Jackson came alive right now
He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky Madoff everything I deserve
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We ain't never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn
'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked

[Verse 3: Stalley]
I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me
My future's so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle

[Bridge: Wale]
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine

[Verse 4: Wale]
There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas -- lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle

[Verse 5: Meek Mill]
I'm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
I'm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
Probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a billion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, we'll hurt you
Life in the power circle

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggas
I tried to warn you niggas
It's too late now
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga
Ugh!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louis's Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin's margin
Maintaining my modest, modest as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, whats up, daddy?
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright

I'm going through something with life

Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties
So what's up, baby? I said what's up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills
Credit card late fees, Capital One popping up on my caller ID
Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
Man that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear
You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies cause then they'll be on it
See I know when the harsh reality take its toll
Open up your contacts then scroll
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, whats up daddy
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Welcome to my diary, hmm.. where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtle neck
Convertibles with turbojets, fueled by 7-Up and prometh'
I feel like deaths around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot, Tequila hit me like a nina
My sky's gray, my bitches brighter
Always saying lights please, J. Cole's her ghost writer
And I'm the God MC, join my diocese
Free your mind, don't mind society
And finally, everyone got their own problems
Everything is subject to change like broken dollars
I'ma drown in my drink and swim in my woman's vagina
Like a piranha fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patrón
Give me that, once you give me that, once again it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby momma what it do?
Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is?
Go on poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready
I'mma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me...

Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough, if I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough if I offend you...

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
And caught that flat, in the mean T Flats
And it made me think if we could blink
To change locations where we at
We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car note due and you 'bout to get evicted
Two drugs surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life
You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it, nigga
But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, man I hate to work for them
One time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
(Soul!) Balls deep, ya dig? Retrieve, relief, ya dig?
Let's kill a bottle of tequila
And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?
What's up? I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day
'Cause all I've been thinking the whole day...

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patrón
Give me that, once you give me that, once again it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby momma what it do?
Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is?
Go on poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready
I'mma lay it down like a carpenter, when you let me...

[Verse 1]
I was born on February 24th, 1970
The day I was delivered they said I would build a legacy
Picture me with influence that last generations
I was made out of love to keep you happy and educated
The first three letters of the alphabet my name
I made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sing
I been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac
So dearly way before the fact me and pops was estranged
My father was a public figure, bigger than life
Lived as a winner, on stages alike
Rivers of people surely united, just to see our bond
Time carried on, that was a common thread
My perfect father had many flaws
Still they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison
He had more children, I was the oldest
We always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'em
He told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatings
Sexually touched and abused, never seen life in a school
The price of being iconic was demonic and screwed
I stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news
Stress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused
I knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldn't choose
See, it was more than humiliation and bein' sued
They crucified my affiliation for points to prove
And now my purpose for livin' makes no difference to you
My total existence was for makin' a smiling move
They said that I'll live forever
But the moment he died, more accusations arrived
I had to die too

[Verse 2]
I remember takin' my first breath August 28th, 1963
The whole nation had saved the day, I made it on TV
My come out was a standing ova', the crowd in disbelief
How could a group of words be so great?
Designed to make you think
Races and faces embracin' my conscience in letter form
How gracious was I speakin' on changes once outside the norm?
The person responsible, my creator
He never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation
Watch him perform with conviction
Two hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen
I gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission
His life became heroic, then tables turned
My creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned
Other women, infidelity stricken, I can't say he was perfect
It made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me
I prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy
How many lives'll fall on deaf ears if I'm not worthy?
I won't justify his personal problems, that's not my job
I was only born to make sure your children can play outside
And I imagine the other demons he hid before he died
If they came to surface this dream probably won't be alive
Because of you

[Verse 3]
I was born in paranoia, it's poison for us
We can't create with joyous ambition, we're out of luck
The critics formed a new coalition and huddled up
The non-creators are now elated and out of touch
Why can't you gladly appreciate the influence we give?
Stop starin' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you'd lived
You want the head of the messenger and the history from him
Which eventually takes away from the good you accustom
Think of a life without the likes of imagination that's prosperin'
The bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in
The great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice
Why can't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ?
Because your better judgement will always look down on me
But if I recollect how we connect, you'll account on me
I got a theory that most of y'all won't allow to see
It goes like this, talent doesn't choose morality
See, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?
If Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars?
I can't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a god
Just know the Earth is just a rock without the voices of art
Sincerely yours

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Got the ghetto in my heart every time that I spit it
Walk it like I talk it, this is how I'm living
Still on the block, dwelling with my niggas
We don't got no job, selling dope be our business
Lord be my witness, trying to get a million
Flushing everything if they run inside my building
Niggas steady snitching
Bitches steady riffing
Raffing, until I start clapping, I'm itching
I'm so Cal
Cals under my white tee when I walk out
Niggas be hating, I don't trust smiles
Me and Ransom representing the same struggle
In the gutter it's all about money and muscle
Feds don't want to see us free
They got us under surveillance like TMZ, yeah
It's Jay Rock, I be these streets
I promise to keep it real 'til I D-I-E, yeah

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I was on the block, ducking, running from cops
On the corner slanging the rock (Mama she used to pray for me)
Now I'm on top, pulling up in the drop
Saying peace to hip-hop (Cause it made a way for me)
I struggled way before I got on
So I gotta put my struggle in song (I guess this was my destiny)
Came a long way, I'm here to stay
[Verse 2: Ransom]
We all came from the gutter
Say we ball free, living by the name of my brother
Put the cane in the cubbard
Childhood scars from the pain that we suffered
Mom dukes always tried to raise us above it
Pop dukes always tried to claim that he loved us
Now we blaming each other
Got my brain from my mother
You can't judge a book by the grain of its cover
Or the name, or the color
I sold drugs to my nigga Pop
So you know the devil's on my side when I hit the block
So you shouldn't be surprised when I get the guap
Flip the rock, watch the water bubble when it hit the pot
A fiend died last night, time to switch the tops
If you don't know what time it is you better fix your clock
Now we're not even surprised when the pistol pop
We don't even move, know the rules never snitch to cops
I just spent my whole life trying to make it out
Dreaming of a check, in a Lex, throwing paper out
They're trying to break the house
Got to go the safest route
Not a blind date, but these apes trying to take me out
I used to be a nobody from the projects
Now my projects got me flyer than a cockpit
I used to cop bricks, loading up Glock clips
Now I'm in the drop picks, talking about stock tips
Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating
I ain't filthy rich, but I got imagination
It's my year to eat and I got a platter waiting
Sharks in the water, I sort of got them salivating
I'm living a life considered a price
My past years could've had me up in prison for life
I am the, tip of the ice, division of christ
This duffle bag red nigga, just admit it I'm nice (and um..)
[Hook][Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
It's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorstеps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in thе streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & The Weeknd]
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
It's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & The Weeknd]
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Damn girl looking good in your baby phat
You got an ass a skinny nigga could handle that
Look I ain't T-Pain I don't love strippers
I might buy em a drank if that ass thicker
Look I’m a hustler I like to get the cash quicker
And I don’t settle for less I’m not no ass kisser
I’m the ladies man bring your lady friends
I’mma bring my niggas and we can get it in
She like to pop pills, I like to pop steel
And leave a bitch ass nigga with a doctor bill
You fully load ma you don’t need Dr. Phil
I got this Mary Jane shit ease your mind forreal
Lets take a trip to my apartment
Take a lil shot of patron get it started
You fuckin’ with a gangster tonight so say goodbye to the waynester type
You with the Rock

[Kendrick Lamar]
Let me tell y’all something
I seen this bitch right she fine than a motherfucker I ain’t gone lie straight up
I take her home though, fucked and got off, pitbull type

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now do I love them hoes, hell no
Take her to the swap meet before Melrose
Benihana, more like like Top Ramen noodles
Champagne no sweet Kool-Aid made by Sherane
Send her back to her boyfriend with cum stains
I redesign bitches wardrobe
All I do is make up something then sit it between her earlobes
She thinking no one ever invented clothes
Used to hide the camera in the closet
Now I’m like I’m doing you a favor to fuck you bitch pose
They don’t even want to go to award shows
They just wanna award me with hoes
Put em on a track like vocals
Leave em for a day and they want their master back like the first album by Jay
I dash with the dividends no shit if Big Pimpin is a sin then I rather not repent (preach)

[Outro]
Girl on the phone
You know I need my master back like Jay Z first album
Okay I got this one girl her name is tity pop her name is what?
Her name is tiny pop I met her at USC she’s a good girl



[Intro: Bēkon]
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Maybe I wasn’t there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there



[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall

[Verse 1: Punch]
Ayo, the sky scorchin’, acid rain fallin’ from the porches
These boys out here peddlin’ porcelain to the less fortunate
We knee deep in the bride of the four horsemen
Can’t tell the trees from where the forest is
More coffins filled with good lookin’ corpses
The Nickerson Gardens is like a graveyard, braveheart cemeteries
Seventh grade school picture on the cover of the obituary
I wrote it in my scrolls, literary student, a visionary nuisance
The voice of the movement, peep out the window, articulate confusion
The YG's raise the baby thugs like soldiers
Teach ‘em to run spots and throw ‘em from the shoulder
Shooters, gun toters, the older ones control them like MK ULTRA
Violence, the code of silence, baby girl wylin’, she got a thousand problems
She do hair and sell dope out of the same housing, she be too busy mouthing
In everybody business, the first one to start singing faced with a sentence
Section 8 tenants, the black and white buildings, parole violators, government assistance
GR recipients, collect checks and hit licks, [?] they sleeping with two bricks
Sold them wholesale to a snitch
They caught him on camera, promised him a sweet deal if he flipped
Plus they got him with the hammers, gun powder residue
That’s what I seen out my project window
Let it run, Q
(Smart ghetto ass)

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall

[Verse 2: Punch]
It’s only fair that I warn ya out in California
It ain’t safe to wear less than armor
But event the night fall when the day break is draped in smog
Shorty got longer arms than the law
Thinking he could box with God
You catch an onslaught even at breakfast, think is hard
Pause, yeah, they bake on bake meaning the couch
Young nigga shoot back and watch and hit everybody
Cause everybody ain’t affiliated
Whether you active or faking, it’s part of the demographic
That’s what’s fueling my hatred for the inner city
Blues, this music when them tools clatchin’
Kids get to answer questions in their middle school classes
Can’t recite a rap classic verbatim
Take 36 ounces, break ‘em down without weighing them
We can’t pay ‘em the attention crime paying ‘em
The ‘jects raise us to raise guns, the day ones
When them raids come, just play dumb, don’t say nothing
Do the bidding, spray and blend in, take the fade
Educate yourself, read up on the case
80% time served, 40k flipped the bird
Read the terms of your probation
He ain’t listen, he’d rather kick it with no henchmen
Gang conjunction, that’s violation, no more smiling faces
That’s the basis of what’s facing the younger generation
No more Reaganomics, just Obama’s promise
Got me sick to my stomach, make me want to vomit
A vicious cycle in rotation like the chronic
They light the chronic, sip the Henny, load the hollows in the semi
Pull it back until it’s empty on the enemy
That looks like them, self-hatred is a rare gem
Get out the water if you can’t swim

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall
So you can tell ‘em come get me now
When are we getting old?

[Verse]
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC Oh my God you gotta see
There’s never no I's in me
Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I’m so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don’t care where ya are
Just blink twice and I’m there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It’s gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I’mma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I’m going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to a fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J’s put us in PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although I’m in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Get it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, he’s slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I’m un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I’m a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I’m a factor and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, Fuck!

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
They say that I'm the one
And you, you are the prototype
You might have the ears of sound
But you already know who they like
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I am the truth, no lie about it
Bring my testimony when I walk in that booth
Walking the thin line between love and hate, I defend mines
Join them when it comes to their crunch time, I never fold
I love pressure, that's why I apply so much on niggas thinking they better
I am a clutch shooter, I am a sharp shooter
And it's great enough to hear the butterfly moving
Follow me moving through these ghetto streets and school I say fuck retarded sweep
Walk into school the chief right there tried to talk at me
In the midst of Piru and natty Blood beef
Shall we hesitate or walk down [?]
That 10-grade summer we had death right in front of us
Then leave the house without kissing our mamas
The new Jordans came out, but we didn't get them
Cuz the color haunt them to get too much attention
Damn it I liked it thoughs
Pac was talking 'bout the concrete rose
I never seen one till I looked in the mirror
There go, huh huh, that's the flow right there
You should use it, that's what my conscience said then I hopefully abused it, huh
I am the lyrics and the music, y'all rapping note for the beat
I let the instrumentals listen to me
I listen to heat, my ears can hear fire
I pierce through the flame like barbed wire breaking up concrete
And I ain't thinking 'bout no rap beef
Niggas is getting killed throughout the week, that's every day
Catchin' bullets like an umpire
We tried to stay home but still ain't safe
That's baseball tactics, retaliation back and forth like tennis rackets, we used to it
Who can circle 'round the block the fasters
If you can do it, think you know why it becomes a practice
We worked it out like barely total
Cuz shit happens

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype

[Verse 2: Punch]
I ain't even rap but let them young boys get ya
Paint a perfect picture like I'm rhyming only scripture
I'm nice, ice water veins, it's pure no filter
Who you get your style from, the same real familiar like I heard it before
But reincarnation is a blind man spirit
So I ain't going for it, na uh
I ain't having it, you getting to board it
Like an unfair mother, my child you gon suffer
To you acknowledge to whom gave you life to knowledge in Zion learning and taking deuce through college
The prototype for the flows you like
I'm surgical Ronald Mike, I cut you up somethin' nice
Get out the pocket, I'm sending them skyrockets right through your minds
Optic popping out your eye sockets, ah
Excites a riot every time I'm rhyming
In accordance with the snare I got impeccable time, Junior

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
They say that I'm the one
And you, you are the prototype
You might have the ears of sound
But you already know who they like
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype

Say I'm Proud To Be Hmong
H.M.O.N.G

Aggression Taken The Day That We All Was Birth
Let These Suckaz Know How much We All've Been Hurt
I Say I'm Proud To Be Hmong
H.M.O.O.B
That's Who I Am & That's Who I'll Always Be
Believe In(G) Lies Was So Wrong I Tell It All
And Let 'Em All Know EveryBody Sing Along

*Verse 1*
Living life without an answer
And unsolvable questions
Hoping God will hear our prayers
As we sit here and listen
But Oh No!
I guess this life for us is tragedy
Believe in me
I try to make us see the image that we want to see
And if we help the damn U.S
But we ain't even treated with the same respect
Explain that!
My brothaz on crack
They try to fight back
Drug convinced
So you know that they ain't never fight back
My sistaz on knees
They wanted y'all to see
A good women of Hmong
Live in communities
But y'all was too blind to realize
So fuck off
Don't let me change my damn mind
With Real lies
And if we plead
To what we believe
A damn change will lead
The life that we wanna see
So bare along with me
As we sing this melody
For my Hmong OGz
Uhh
My H.M.O.O.B

*Verse 2*
So it has come down to this
Racist niggas deserve to get diss
They talking many shit
How we Hmongs couldn't make it
Now I'm here to speak the truth
Let us rise as a leader of youth
Brains be planted like the roots
I'm here to show ya
I'm Tony Vue
I'm coming thru
Showing all my fellow gooks
Showing that we real we true
So keep your fist high and fight for your life
They say life is a test but are they right
Trouble seems to be attached to us like magnets
No time to wait for homos & faggots
Just live your life & just love it
Cause most of us will never make it
Only take some to say it
So take this opportunity and take it
I promise you You'll need it
No time to even waste it
With all these hesitation
And muthafuckaz complaining
We own this muthafuckin' game
So rep Hmong All the way
And say H.M.O.N.G Nigga, Yeee!



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I fall in with an attitude, Billy badass with a back pack full of bad swag
That I picked out I'm a hand it out to, anyone that ever did wrong to me anything that
Did wrong to me I'm a take it back like a vac, you pay tax tonight. Bully!

[Verse 1: Mark Foster]
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette, hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six shooter gun
In his dad's closet hidden with a box of fun things, and I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you

[Hook: Mark Foster] (x2)
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Run boy
Are you ready
(Kendrick)
Do I look like danger? Do I look like a criminal's anger? Do I look like problem when I tell 'em
That I got 'em? I can even make the famous famous. Pull up, pull up bring it back up rewind
Then I pull out the cups then we pull out the wine
I'm a rebel you a rebel then I'm bout to rock
Climb, I'm a ticking time bomb in California, land mine!
Explode everytime you run, your ligaments stay ahead of me
Everybody say they killing the game, I shoot! and you dead Meat

[Hook: Mark Foster] (x2)
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet

Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus: Ice Cube]
...gang 
Like  a chain more, this is purple rain
Young whippersnapper, hit you with my fucking aim...

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
...you youth listening side off, so hope
I  take chances, you throw tantrums
I  drop hits, you drop soap
And you plant it, I'm romantic

[Hook: Glensky]
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Turbo-charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to yo mufuckin' self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
'Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff

[Hook: Glensky]
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
When you a man, action is what’s expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em
It’s carpe diem hey (hey) yeah

[Hook: Glensky]
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Like kindergarteners
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in–
–to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck has been
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
I'm focused

[Hook: Glensky]
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

[Verse 1]
Now listen my friends, not to offend
But this is a story told over again
So many niggas tryin' to fuck with the king
But the only problem is they can't win
I gets down my younging
Please turn it up just to sound my younging
I burned it up that's your town my younging
Either the cake or the trait bound my younging
This the brand new trunk
Rattling, B tackling
Big truck paddling
Dime piece beauty peagant-ing
Pick em up then they (uh) saddling

Maybach, the 1960 flow
With my brim kind of tilted low
So fresh oh yes it's me suppose

These chickens tryin to plot on a boy
So a nigga gotta move kinda low
(Low what?) low key
I put 26 inch rims on the ride
Big truck fit five chicks at a time
Stones big enough you can go rock climb
Put that on somethin'
Nah man I was lying
But tell me what you know about it (know about it)
Fat camp I can't go without it (go without it)
This ain't hot, I truly doubt it
Mapped out the whole game so reroute it
‘Cause look here boo you fucking with a champion
K Dot the don, moving the blocks you on
Taking a spot of shawn, I'm on top you're on
Industry remember me, cause I so crazy

I got a pool, inside of a pool, inside of a jacuzzi
And I ain't lying
Man, I'm not lying
My sister got a jacuzzi in her bed, in her pool
That's how we living
That's on me
That's on everything I love*Lyrics from Snippet 1*

[Intro: Colin Clive & Kendrick Lamar]
It's alive, it's moving
It's alive, oh it's alive
It's alive, it's alive
It's alive in the name of god
Now I know what it feels like to be God
I, K-Dizzle

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I rap with a Pyrex in the projects
I'm crack in a pot, I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate on a dock full of dope, uh
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You can not test no King in a Tesla
Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras, uh

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It's Alive (Uh, uh, shit, shit, uh, uh, shit, shit)...

*Lyrics from Snippet 2*

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
...I'm not a newcomer, I'm a new wonder elite
Break the handcuffs, choke slam the officer...

So you’re performing in Brixton on Monday, what happens at one of your live shows?

Craziness. A lot of energy, a lot of energy from myself and the crowd

How do you feel in front of a crowd?

I feel at peace, you know. It’s a way to express yourself, a way to vent, put all your emotions out on that stage

Where was your first ever gig?

My first ever was at a hole in the wall place, in a small city, in a small club in Los Angeles

What happened?

I was probably terrible.. But it was a growing experience, a growing process, and you know, you never forget those moments

Who was the first person to tell you that you were good at music?

The first person to tell me was probably this guy named Dave Free, he’s my manager now, since I was like tenth grade...yeah

How did he discover you?

Through a mutual friend, it was all in high school, rapping and stuff. And then a mutual friend told him about me and we decided to start doing music and we’ve been doing it ever since

How did he help you to develop your sound?

He really just allowed me to experience different things in music, and listen to different people, he got a broad playlist in music everybody from west coast, to the east coast. And basically we just started developing there

You said in an interview before that your mum told you that whatever you do, you just gotta do it really, really well. What does she make of your success now?

Oh yeah, she loves it. She sees that I took heed in what she was saying because you have people that’s calling me the best at what I do, and you know l pride myself in that. She always said that whatever you do make sure that you're the best at it

What kind of a son were you when you were younger?

I was a good son, respectful, I never disrespected my mother, I never disrespected my father intentionally. Probably some of the things I did, outside of the house were a little bit outlandish, but as far as verbal disrespect or inner presence disrespect, never, so, I was a good son

What are your earliest memories of their music?

A lot of oldies, gangster rap was played in my household, which really inspired my sound today from new melodic driven, aggressive type feel

What track or album have you listened to more than any other?

That’s hard, that’s tough. They played a lot of 2Pac All Eyez On Me, Me Against The World, they probably played that track a hundred thousand times in our house

How did the collaboration with Drake happen?

I went on his Club Paradise tour and we really built a bond, a relationship, since the first time we met. He put me on his album, which was the interlude, red light interlude, we always said it was gonna work, it was just about finding the right song, that was the right song

What happened in your first meeting with Dre?

I was very excited, I wasn’t nervous at all. I was more excited, cause I knew that this was my shot, everything that l've worked for, everything I’ve built up to came down to that moment

What happened in that moment?

That moment I recorded my first song with Dre, which was Compton, which is the last song on my album

Do you speak to him on a daily basis?

Yeah I talk to him

And what’s he up to at the moment?

At the moment he’s just working his Beats by Dre. Doing a lot of promo and press for that, getting buried in life right now

Can you see yourself moving to projects outside of music like he does with Beats?

Yeah definitely. You know when you conquer one thing, you want to move on to the next and be able to challenge yourself? He inspired me to want to do that, once l get the years behind me, of being exceptionally great at music

Are you creative in other ways outside of the music?

Yeah. I'm very hands on with the whole visual and concepts beyond the music

Are you a competitive person?

Very competitive

So where does success lie?

Success lies in challenging myself, thats where l get my success

And how will you ever be fulfilled?

Probably when l see that my music has touched more people than l can possibly imagine, and that point in time will come

What do your lyrics say about you as a person?

My lyrics say that I have morals, say that I have confidence, say I have weaknesses, say I have strong points, say l am a human being

What are the morals that you live by?

Treat others the way you want to be treated. That’s the number one, that’s something that my mother always told me. That’s the one piece of advice I would give everybody and the world would be a better place

Can you tell me about the picture on the front cover of the album?

The front cover really represents the lifestyle that I’m used to, the coming up, seeing a lot of parties, a lot of good times, a lot of bad times and really I blanked the eyes out so that you see the innocence, the little boy that’s in there, which is me. No matter what he is around, you still see the vulnerability in this kid, you know that he wants to figure out whats going on around him

Do you think your music comes from a positive place?

Yes. My music comes from a positive place, only because I was once in a dark place before in my life so, to actually get to that positive space you have to come in this negative world, where you’re striving to do something better for yourself

How did you allow those negative situations to not affect you, or jade you?

Just knowing something was bigger than me, something was bigger than just Compton, something was bigger than the trouble we were getting ourselves involved in, I knew something was more, and l wanted more for myself. Not only for myself but for the people l care about

Are you still based in Compton now?

No, I’m a rolling stone. I don’t have a place to stay. Im roaming the world

What do you do with all your stuff?

My mother has all that stuff. I’m in the world now, I like to see other things. Cause for so long when you're in Compton, its all you think that exists, so when I finally got out to see other places, like London, it makes you want to continue the travel

When you're travelling what are things you have to have with you at all times?

Fresh pair of drawers, fresh pair of socks

How have you been enjoying London?

I love it. Y’all weather’s a bit gloomy right now, I like gloomy weather, I work best and do most of my album under gloomy weather, so you’ll hear a lot of dark tracks in there

How are British fans different to your US fans?

There's a little bit more excitement with British fans, a little bit more energy, I think you guys just appreciate a little bit more

Out of all the tracks you have written, which do you feel the most proud of now?

The most proud of is tough, I've written a lot of tracks. If it had to be from this album, any one off this album really, sing about me, l’m real, Compton

From the previous mixtapes, are there any songs that you’ve written that you find difficult to listen back to now?

What’s crazy is that l don’t listen to none of my older music, just because I always wanted the team to grow. I don’t wanna get caught back in that time, or critiquing what i should have done or what sounds right

Who will you collaborate with in the future?

I’m really tight on collaborations, I always say Erykah Badu, that’s it for now, that’s always in the back of my mind

[Intro: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathin' in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping up, checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
YA! YA! YA! YA!

[Hook]
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan
YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all, duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
Lets get It!

[Hook]
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"I said, where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I say—
YA! YA! YA! YA!

[Hook: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
[YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!]
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Bridge: Dan Reynolds+Kendrick Lamar]
All systems go
[Systems go]
The sun it hasn't died
[Hasn't died]
Deep in my bones
[In my bones]
Straight from inside

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]

Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, when they start their Martial Law
When these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Lord, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't really care and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, energy go to the almighty God
Drown in a bottle of Hennessy, with no amenities
I'm gettin' better with time
Aaah!

[Hook: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones

Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time, can you
Hey

Oh

Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time
[Dan Reynolds]
Radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathin' in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping out, checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa

[Hook: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We'll paint it red for the blood that rose
Whoa
I'm breakin' in, shapin' up
Checkin' out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

[Hook: Dan Reynolds]

[Verse 1 - MeLo-X]
Was a good student, got all As
So the music that I'm producing is sort of like high grade
You can get so high that
You won't need a pilot
Everytime you listen you're gaining frequent flyer mileage
Politic on project knowledge with street scholars
In need of fatter wallets so they seek dollars
Holla, at the God, inhale, exhale
Then hail the king draped in Pharaoh's bling
Or something like it
Some will like it, others won't
But understand the flow is as smooth as a summer night is
Off the top when I write this
And the plan is to get a girl with the same eyes
As the goddess Isis
Looking for my Nefertiti in the city
Where we substituted hieroglyphics for graffiti
Don't get smacked silly, with ill battle raps
Under pressure niggas twist like sprite bottle caps
Tell Semtex to gather all his effects
Cause this here might get a few bombs from Flex
A few niggas vexed when we on the set
So a few niggas gotta get palms and necks
Cracked, snapple pop, pay attention ahk
Me and Mickey bout to make this Black apple pop
Like Snapple tops
From BK to the City of Angels
City where niggas throw up their hands in angles
To represent their tribes
And other colors, niggas love us
Kiss the mothers, raise the brothers I'll teach you something
You niggas got the game all wrong
You rapping for niggas in all y'all songs
I got songs like "Treat Her Right" unh
Ladies know when I perform, I be the right form
Any blog, website, Tumblr or forum
You're drug trafficking when you post up these poems
Love it or you don't
But yo my lyrics you will quote
You wanna see whats up, get a beat thats tough
I'll eat it up for sure
If you live than I'm liver, if you hot than I'm lava
Burning up, I'm the agua, shut you down when I rise up
Fucking ducking when I come in bucking with something rugged
Niggas can hate it, but as long as the ladies they love it
Check out the ratio at all our shows
I'm the God, I get all the...queens

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick Lamar the modern day Malcolm
Humble and modest but these margins can move a mountain
I moshpit on the beat and leave the mark of a thousand ,Marksmen
Clearing the street and killing rappers with talent, preach
Yes I said talent, Kendrick ain't scared of y'all, can’t even spell competitor
Lord is my witness
I remember asking artists in streets how they did it
The only features I got is was this handsome face I was getting
How ironic, playing Sonic was the shit like a colonic
Now we vomit over these beats while critics pay homage
This is too street like my 23 summers in Compton
I go so deep, like my dick in your bitch hope the condom never do leak
2 seats, one car, all you hear yes daddy and snapped bras
High salary blow jobs, low calorie rap bars not me
My sweet 16 will probably need a school ID
And usually I be, the dominant victor
You know what time it is nigga
Affirmative Action, you fact or you fiction?
I’m a slain cracker from being insane
Pop a vein when I write this shit
I’m think on the shit, I'm vain and I think you’re a bitch
A female poodle under some homo's voodoo, sucking the industry's dick
We catching bodies, shooting dice in the hotel lobby, fuck your security
And that's at the Ritz-Carlton
My impurity's probably your best asset
I spit acid, hit your block and crumble your address
Leaving them stagnant
This is torture when I scorch you, or escort you
Out the building where ex-convicts with all sorts of
Portable handshanks, your man can’t stick to the script with handpaint
Popping your lip then popping the clip then popping your van, wait
We want the peace, but keep a piece
Said I was Malcolm to your belief whats up

[Verse 3 - Mickey Factz]

It's Mickey

From the depths of the seas
Back to the rap
Mick Factz motherfucker
From the, the, the Black Apple
Where the nightmares reign supreme
Stay ahead never beg cause I aim to please
Brain disease, sick spit flame degrees
That'll make Satan leave 'til his veins will freeze
Museum Mick, international women with high class
Will do E and look at you like I'm gassed
Oxymoron, big dog evict frauds
Slick boss that shop, tags get ripped off
I don't lie about what I cop like Rick Ross
Come to broads I dish off like Chris Paul
Quickdraw McGraw shoot and spit raw
I'm too hot cause I was born with a pitchfork
This kid hard, when I'm pissed off you lift off
These lip gloss ass rappers are so chick soft

Look lil mama, we ain't blood so Crip-walk
We ain't fam, you ain't my man so skip off
You get your Rafer on, I get my paper on
I'm sonning cats, I'm getting my Darth Vader on
Check the program
I'm killing rappers
Barbarian, I'm Conan
You hear the flow man

The best I know with my chest out bro
The Achievement is coming, thats not an Xbox goal



[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Fair warning, people would have never had a problem
If the naysayers or the doubters would have got him
Slumped in the corner, for sure I'm a goner
Shoot with no aim, so them niggas couldn't spot him
Now I got a question, if I really even want it
When this shit is like a trip through the city of Sodom
Gomorrah, the horror, stories are endless
Workshop, working all night, no apprentice
Funny when a nigga speak truth he a menace
Ushered in the underground, lifelong sentence
There's where I dwell, ain't no need to cry for me
Rapper gonna eat, and I eat well
It's been six years since I stepped out the shell
Talent on the rise to the top, I propel
Big Dho set sail, your boy gon' win
Bet niggas act crazy when they see us again
I'm really going in, I've been had nothing to lose
So I choose to take y'all through a spin
A journey through the mind of a sane ass artist
If you spitting blah-blah shit, you a target
If you spitting blah-blah shit, then just forfeit
What go around come around, now they all on my dick

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick Lamar, I'm bout to get my mop stick
Niggas bump their gums, and their bitches be bumping my shit
I fry your optics, if you watching my style, watch it
Tyrannosaurus reading thesaurus, hold rappers hostage
Catastrophic, it's 9-11 when I'm repping
Skip college to fly first class, learn a lesson
Straight brutal, roman numerals
Number one eating Ramen noodles, rhyming crucial under the sun
Kudos to the most high, which is me
I probably make 'em plan their suicide, so usually
I ain't never been with the shit starting, but y'all done started some shit
I'm 'bout to drink some ex-lax then commence
To returning the favor to all of my neighbors and comrades
Calm down, you more like Trina than Trinidad, let's box now
Throw your dukes up
Pussy probably holding Daisy Dukes and C-cups
I look inside this industry and I don't see much
I just see lunch, and your shit that's more bore like tourists
I'm laid back, my feet up, how cool is that?
The twenty-ten Kool G. Rap, whenever I rap
I got my arsenal strapped on my back, I'm ready for war
They tend to look for me when they fiend for Afeni Shakur
Conversing, not hibernating, under the planet core
At thirteen I cancelled PG-13 and went for gore
That's what I pledge
It's profound that I'm underground touching 'mainstreams' like river beds

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, (Ab-Soul) they saying he a breath of fresh air (light?)
They can't smell all this weed that I brought in here
Black & Mild smoke still linger on my clothes
So unprofessional, I shouldn't be meeting with millionaires
Pull up a chair, I'll school you to it
I was a student truant that never studied, just always knew it
You just new to it, with no clue on how you should do it
Like youth in junior high school when puberty's blooming
And mind you, I never mined you, I ain't digging for gold
Honestly, I just want to stick my dick in some hoes
Kick a flow, hit the 'dro with my bros
Tippy-toe in this rap game, make a lil' name
With this lil' lane I've been paving since I was a teen
That I never really thought that I would attain
When Big Pooh dropped 'Sleepers' I could barely get a feature
They ain't know this regular nigga would be the future
I've viewed the roof from the floor, I've been here before
I'm finna blow a couple of times over like two tubas
And I'm a still want more with this appetite
Till the critics stop giving me mixed signals like traffic lights
You know? The lavish life, but for now I'm the new Kunta
A slave to my rhyme book, a line of mine, your time's up
The bastard kissing your bitch with the blackish soup coolers
She'll testify, excuse Judas when I'm crucified

[Produced by Tommy Black]

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
My back against the wall, like I see y'all fronting
Drowning in your own spit and ain't coming up with nothing
I call this shit "Rapper Shit" cause I ain't a rapper
But if I was, this ain't some shit that I could rap after
Caught up in the rapture, you call yourself a factor
You're lame, paving a way Bob could build faster
I'm a real master, real massive, you just real average
I see your chain, it's strange, they wore those in the Middle Passage
And it's harder to play me than to fiddle backwards
Don't act like you knew my tactics
Cause when it hits the fan, you know I stand last
I see through your true colors like stained glass
I see the fear in your eyes when we arrive
And what's the odds of even thinking you coincide
When every time a nigga open a door you go inside
Just to realize, either you're weak or someone lied
See, you spend more time boasting about what you do than you do
So by the time your shit is due it's doo-doo
And who knew that too cool fool who used to sit in the back
Would slip through the crack, like dudes who went to rehab
Ab-Soul, Abstract Asshole
Black Lip Bastard, et cetera for forever
I follow no ruler, even if I'm under a drastic measure
But whatever
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
They say pressure bust pipes
And I ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now that's a bar
Sparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral
Or colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms
You would test me but you know better
It's inadequate to go against the Jesus of Nazareth
Of the rap game, and guess what, I got no cheddar
But my mind is like a wizard
I defy the laws of gravity every time I get high and write a sentence
Back teeth never been in agony, but I got wisdom
I have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition, Scorch ya, third degree burns next to their sideburns,
All sorts of combustible flows, firemen on speed dial
Free the leaders of the free world with a freestyle
Free the teachers, black activists get up off your feet now
And feed off my feelings
As I control my wheel like new power steering, so sincere
Tryna duck court hearings but I got big ears
Rap peers, used to study them wishing they would fuck with me
Now they can't fuck with him, I'm wishing good luck to them
Reluctantly these critics loving me and I don't blame 'em
They say, Kendrick you gunning for these niggas
So when I pull my weapon out, I give 'em the pleasure to see me aim it
And watch these bullets run into these niggas, clear the set
I got now, I got next, give you nouns, give you verbs
Give you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat
I am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me
Big homie fear young, buck cause when I buck I make more than a buck
Dollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time
Put me in Alaska for six months in the dark, in my heart I know sun still shine
Still got a skill to be found in a gold mine
[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I got an appetite for habitual liars on the mic
Who with pliers couldn't get a grip on life
I spit like I sat the tip of my dick on ice, and that's intense
Imagine if I had already came twice, ain't that some shit
Pass the swisher nigga, fill your cup with liquor nigga
Fly your kite till you're gone till November nigga
Show 'em you remember nigga
Pour some Hennessy and Crown for your homie six feet underground
Smoke an ounce and turn that frown upside down
Like the triangle in the panties of my gal
When Mike Jack made "Raining in Moscow" I had no style
Tommy Boy stocking on my scalp
And that was like ninety-five, now it's twenty-ten
Two years away from when they say the world's expected to end
And I ain't even begin
That's more ironic than a bum asking for 50 Cent from "Many Men", one

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Too many relays for DJs to replay
I do the reject while I eject your new singlay
Hot enough to sit in hell, then unveil in heatwave
Piss on a demon with ice water
And if I lose my voice then I'm probably calling out to all P.A
Systems to assist in with the word I'm tryna spread
Like county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie
And that's off top like a toupee, I'm 2Pac
Coming back for doomsday, spitting at cops, go and cop my album
Get high to it, pop some valium, then turn up the volume
I influence ghettos where it says caution
And them bloggers get to sparking like L.A. females that's balling
Round the time this happens often, the violence get the flare
We racing against life, the turtle or the hare?
And nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build
Y'all work at Build-A-Bear soft as underhand pitching with skills
[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Shit, and ain't no use in crying over spilt milk
You're dead and gone
The pall-bearers carry you and your family will carry on
And on the real, this ain't a construction site but you know the drill
We lead the league in all aspects
And we deserve more medals than a magnet
Put you niggas in a hole like bad debt
Shooting three pointers with the globe, nothing but nets

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga, nothing but the best
Every time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck
I rhyme like a fucking TEC-9,
And I 'Clown Posses' if they disrespect
You looking at a T-Rex snapping at 'em with Tourette's
Yeah, this the flow that killed aspiring rappers
Too late, I grab the eight and start expiring rappers
Some shit only BIG and Pac could rap after
And if they was alive, they would have to pay tithes
I am God
M.C.R. squares will disperse in despair, this is me motherfucker

[Intro]
Rare Breed, Kendrick Lamar
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up

[Verse 1]
This is for my niggas that be all blacked out
Hit the streets a hundred deep, what Rare Breed about?
Riding hard, bending corners, the girlies on us
Leave a hater scarred, big Dressers sit at the stop light
Road Glides and Road Kings deep in my hindsight
You do it right or don't do it at all
Put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie
Custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball
Centre of attention like Bynum and GasolYou know that killer californication
When you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing
Dreams, hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
It's abomination how we bomb yo' block
I'm talking Big Punch, K-Dub, Baby Slip Billy
Bad Azz, Rare Breed, we all we got
See 'em out, show 'em love, chunk the deuce, give it up
It's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard, nope

[Hook]
Pounding on the highway stretch
All blacked out, making sure we on deck
Might catch us on them Dressers or them Road Glides, yes
Tell the world I'm a Rare Breed baby
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up, I'm a Rare Breed baby

[Verse 2]
And it's like that to the death though
Two-oh-point and seeing decimals, I ain't lying
Pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
Or we might be in a hood near you
Around the globe baby, Rare Breed under control baby
Them pipes loud, the movement entice crowds
We heat it up in the cold baby
It's three degrees out? Then you should see me out
Or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
Ha-ha, we be the father of Harley drivers, so don't bother
Show you infants how to whip it, have a bye-bye
Posers try to hang? Then we hang 'em by the collar
Silk, lannie, Rare Breed family
Stunting hard like a black circus, voila
Breed up or speed up, get ahead
So with that said, bye-bye

[Hook][x2]

[Outro]
Shouting out the one and only Rare Breed
Now Breed up!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say "Queen"
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like "because"
Or the word "but," but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me "ball out"?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

[Skit: Kenny Duckworth]
Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Skit: Kenny Duckworth & Paula Duckworth]
Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom
Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do

[Bridge: Anna Wise]
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you

Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you

[Skit: Paula Duckworth]
"If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye."

[Verse 1]
You never knew a plug, plug, plug, a plug like this
Sophisticated gangsta, watch me thug like this
Snatch your, uh, in a club like this
Seven zeros, need my pub like this
Stuck in a rock in a hard place
I am thinkin' I won't bump y'all up, well, I am
I got to get my thing off
My style come from Devin the Dude, Kurupt, 2
And James Brown with his fist crossed
I fluctuate the vocals like Prince Rogers
Whoever thought a billionaire come out of Compton?
Multiply simple logic, it's rules you can follow
If Dre ain't motivation, I don't know who is
Gift and a curse, maybe them shoes is too big
Or maybe I'm too pessimistic to know I'm gifted
Chasin' hood rat brownie points and bullshittin'
I dropped the four on 'em, scrapin', hopped a four on 'em
Grab my dick and pour on 'em
Yeah, homie, I'm still talkin' that whoop-de-whoop
Hoppin' out on my enemies, I know who to shoot
Back when my homies where I need to be
Such a familiar sceneries, I smell the gun smoke
I watched a homie watch his son smoke
I seen the sun set on my set
I seen one 'Ru and one Loc, one slip and one played him close
Everythin' subject to change
Nowadays, the Compton Crip car kill each other
Faster than an opposite color
Homies whack out everythin', you're dead, homie
It's your mother, your uncle and brother
If God was a Loc, he'd probably had one comin'
Damn, that's fucked up, I guess it is
When you can't trust not a soul inside these streets
I made a video out there in Copenhagen, so the homies can see
To let 'em know it's more than just Pamela Lee
They said, "Good looking"
Paused the video the moment his phone ring
That fast dollar was his only problem
No matter how many times I showed him the Eiffel Tower
The block was home and Africa was too far for power
Then I knew

[Bridge]
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
We don't share the same synonyms, fall back
Been in it before Internet had new hacks
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visitin' freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can visit a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction, runnin' pure magic
Thank God for rap, I will say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that? I know everything
I know everything, I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit, that isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's hungry
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
You know, they know that from Compton School District
I give it to the kids, don’t gossip ‘bout how it was distributed
I, I, I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit
Big Boy, what’s up?

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I don’t give a butt  about no politics in rap
My little homie Stunna Deuce ain’t never comin' back
So I got to go hard every time I jump on wax
Bump what they talking ‘bout, this here is where it’s at
Look, I came in this game, I stuck my fangs in this game
I wore no chain in this game, my hood, my name in this game
Now I double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
I’m stickin' to the scripts like, “Yeah, 'em Benjamins can cuddle up”
I skip, hop, I drip-drop, I flip-flop with them white tube socks
It go sherm sticks, watch me burn this
That’s what the chronic smell like when them chemicals mix
Fifty-homie salute, I’m out to Compton Zoo with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans that eff with me
Nobody can eff with me, tell y'all to eff with me
Jumpin' out the Caddy, uh, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called
They said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Homie’s name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don’t fail me now, they want to put the game in town
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Tell me they profit to fuck with you
Nobody can fuck with you, Obama said, "What it do?"

[Bridge]
Can I get one more?

[Verse 4]
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’
Motherfuck if they did, then a nigga'd be platinum
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no politician at award shows
No, don’t ask about my, hoes, no, don’t ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, buyin' land stock



[Verse 1: YG]
I woke up this morning, I had a boner
I went to sleep last night with no bitch, nigga, I was a loner
I be goin' through shit, losin' bitches and homies
If I don't make it with this rap shit, nigga, I might be homeless
My moms don't got a job, my pop's checks ain't enough
If ain't bringin' home that money, my whole family is fucked
That's why I move like the mob, I'm watchin' movies too much
If niggas wanted you dead, what would you suggest?
They wonder why I do drugs and hang with thugs
Since I made it, the city hated, wait, where is the love?
I ride around with my gun, this is not for fun
I stay protected 'cause my homie just took one to the lung
Had him on life support, with his family support
He knew who shot him but he ain't even show up in court
Yeah, that's a real G, nigga, he on a kill spree, nigga
The homie popped him so I hope he don't kill me, nigga

[Hook: YG]
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'

[Verse 2: YG]
Now I'm ridin' through traffic, with 2Pac blastin'
With a bitch that's irritatin' from all these questions she askin'
Like what bitches I fucked, when, how and where?
You ain't my main bitch so why the fuck do you care?
That's why bitches get fucked then turn around and get left
Somebody need to teach them "less talk, more sex"
I'm pressed when I'm stressed, my granny tell me I'm blessed
Well, why the fuck do Jesus Christ got me goin' through this shit?
Everybody need favors, what happen if I go broke?
Or say I ain't got it and buy my lolo some spokes
Right up in your face, said "I'll fuck you up like some mace"
So fuck your handout, give a young nigga some space
Give a nigga some Ace, give me a blunt that's laced
Sprinkle some molly in it, watch me take this shit to my face
The snitch is the shooter, they took time away from his case
Holy shit, oh, lord, where is the world today?!

[Hook: YG]
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I swear this industry shit, to me, is one big-ass lick
I walk inside of a buildin', tell the A&R nigga "strip"
Tell 'em I need all of my chips, my life been on Section 8
I've been a welfare case, AFDC pump fake
Meanwhile, I'm grindin' 'cause drug money ain't like rap money
Four white kilo, snow-bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, they killed Braze
They killed Chad, my big homie Pupp
Puppy eyes on my face, bruh
And I really be drinkin', why the fuck I really been smokin'?
What the fuck? I'm the sober one
Man, I'm so stressed out, I can't focus
Hide out when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
Speed past in the Cutlass, me and little Ocho
Every young nigga hop out
Two tears in a bucket, I feel like "fuck it"
The price of fame, recognize my pain, it's all I know
All out war but I'm out here though
Call my troops like, "vamonos"
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, and it's all bad
Off a OG with my OG and some OE by the tall glass

[Break]

[Hook: YG]
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'

[Outro]
What's happenin', nigga?
Said nigga got this joint, nigga gon' get somethin' real, real nice, like
You gotta stop playin' me with that bullshit
Nah, I'm serious though, like, already checked it out, feel me?
Man, look, check this out, homie, I'm with the shits, man, you already know, what's happenin', what you tryna do?
Man, nigga tryna get paid, like, is you serious or is you playin'?
Nigga, is you serious, nigga? What's up, nigga? You know where I live at, nigga
Nigga I'm done straight 'bout to pull up, though, nigga, for sure, I'll holler
Aight, hold on, though
My nigga, this shit cool? You ain't tryna, you feel me, like?
Like, what's up, nigga?
Nah, you my nigga, cuz!



[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
You niggas don’t even know
All that talk then no show
Cannot tell me nothin'
Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
That hoe want my piccolo
Smoking on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it
While we chop chop on them 24s
She look like a centerfold
Mouth all on my genitals
Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
Rolling up them vegetables
Rapping with that special flow
Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows
Used to sell out all my blow
That was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4
Now a nigga livin' good
I done made it out the hood
Think I'm goin' back?
I wish a motherfucker would

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well
For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell
When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny
I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail
Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch
To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer
With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want, the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)
Givenchy bikers with the rev rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition
Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good
But good could be better I wish a motherfucker would

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life to end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin' in the dark
Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin'
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them
The rev undid, the all day madness
Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then kicked all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Ayy, look what we're enduring
Ayy, ridin' in foreigns
Ayy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry
When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

[Verse 4: Earl Sweatshirt]
Good, hood
I wish you motherfuckin' would
Listen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown
I had to put my foot down
It's like I'm popping a clutch
Your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust
You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?
And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never pass my mama no blunt
And kept my head straight
Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts
You've been the same motherfucker since 2001
Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump
I'm at your house like, "Why you got your couch on my Chucks?"
Motherfucker



[Intro]
I been a real one, I been a real one
I been a real one, I been a real one
I been a- I been a love and a travesty
Never talk down on no prophecy, put it on God, ain't no stopping me
Put it on God, God, God, God, God

[Hook]
I been a real one, I been a real one
I been a real one, I been a real one

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
How can I change the world, but can't change myself?
How can I please the world but not God himself?
How can I have the world, still need some help?
How can I see the world, stuck in this box?

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
I've been trying to figure out my life
I can't see, even in plain sight
Though I cry, my tears don't bring light
Your life is in your rearview

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
How can I change the world, but can't change myself?
How can I please the world, but not God himself?
How can I lead the world when I'm scared to try?
Why should I need the world? We all gon' die

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
I thank God for giving us this life
The day you're born, someone else dies
All in love, all is in life
Your life is in your rearview

[Outro: Raphael Saadiq]
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview
Your life is in your rearview[Verse 1: Game]
Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'm a son of a gun cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes (Busta: son, duke is sick)
The protege of Doc Dre, I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts, sunk like quick sand
Don't stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feeling that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed, I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game and I don't know Dre
You goin' do me like Xzibit and cut half of my face?
I take all the credit for putting the west back on the map
If you ain't feeling that, guess I'm Guerrilla Black

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell 'em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Patty cake, patty cake, microwave
Suckas make a square, goddamn I'm paid (ha ha)
I'm so cool, but I'm so hot, and
I'm, I'm so fly, and you, you're so not (nope)
Show me what you're workin' with just like that (like that)
Turn around, bend over, bring it back (bring it back)
Snowman and Mannie Fresh bring it back (bring it back)
It's Mannie Fresh and Snowman, it's a wrap
Strapped up in the club, yeah I'm so crazy
These other rappers actors like Patrick Swayze (ha ha)
I tried to tell 'em but these niggas ain't hearin' me
Mossberg pump I'm ridin' shotgun literally (daaamn)
Live from the projects, you know what it is
Ay, Snowman, (what up), can I get a ad lib? (yeahhhhhhh)
Get the club crunk, can't take that from me
Ain't dropped yet, still got Lil' Jon money
I got million dollar dreams and federal nightmares (ay)
We pop Cris' my nigga, and still drink beers (dat's riiight)
What did you expect man, I came from nothin' (nothin)
Real street nigga and wouldn't change for nothin' (nah)
Got my niggas out the hood, it's such a wonderful feeling (chea)
Three car garage with the twelve foot ceilings (ay)
It oughta be a crime just to feel this good
I swear it oughta be a crime just to be this hood (ayy)
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell 'em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Fresh wit' the hustle so we bounce back on them suckers
Blowin' big doin' gigs got it ran in hundreds
They reppin' layin' here we stuntin'
On the grind all the time homie gettin' money
3rd Ward soldier 13th gangsta
17th hustler known top ranker
Money go getter them clowns can't figure
Poppin' at the mouth like this cutter won't split 'em
Know how to survive hustlin' stayin' fly
My whole hood cried when my lil' brother died
Know I had to ride never let it slide
It's just the G in me and I'mma get it til I die daddy
Brush the platinum grab the straps homie make it happen
Comin' through my neighborhood with 4's on the Caddy
Limo tints out the pound and Uptown crackin'
Red bandanna duckin' feds and the money stackin'
Rest in peace to Miss Gladys like e'eryday
We on the grind for the shine and we gon' get paid
Spent a mill' on the wheels custom wit' the navi'
2 of the same whips we doin' it big livin' lavish

If you had a second chance in life, what would you do?
Would you put the pills down? Throw out the lean too?
Treat your baby mama right and make way for your kids?
Peace with your enemies, keep the water under the bridge?
I think about if my motorcycle crash was fatal
Broken bones, internal bleedin', stretched on the table
Goin' through surgery, two machines helping me breathe
Sorry mama, I wanna stay but I gotta leave
I see my funeral packed, I see some lyin'
Some cryin' and some givin' dap
I see false claimers, strangers and foes with they head in they laps
I see mo' division
I see some of them showin' up just to post a picture
Like they was my nigga, Instagram's a dead man's best friend
Everybody lookin' for likes but wasn't likin' you when
You needed somethin' to hold on dealin' with life stress
Glad them angels came in surgery, said I'm not done yet!

[Chorus: SZA & Kendrick Lamar]
I know saints, I know sinners, I know bosses
I know pain, I know wins, I know losses
My loyalty is sensitive so please don't cross me
My loyalty is sensitive so please don't cross me
I came to redeem myself
All I need is God's help
It's a millions of miracles
Show me the real you, the real truth
[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
If I had a second chance in life, this what I'd do
I buy you flowers talk to you for hours, give you truth
I listen to you when you're hurt
I shoulda went to church with you
But my credentials didn't work, I still should've worked with you
I should've left them lil' hoes alone and came home
But I blamed the moments on you, though I was in the wrong
You checked my phone and I checked you 'bout it
We never talked it over, instead we just sexted 'bout it
I said, "I'm comin' over", you turned up and flexed about it
I hit yo mama phone
She said, "Y'all get it together", she don't know what we on
My response was whatever, I'm ego trippin' however
I hate to see you gone, she gave me that dial tone
I should've gave you more trust, more love, no lies, more us
'Cause when my motorcycle crashed and everyone left
You was that angel at surgery sayin' I ain't done yet, real shit

[Chorus: SZA & Kendrick Lamar]
I know saints, I know sinners, I know bosses
I know pain, I know wins, I know losses
My loyalty is sensitive so please don't cross me
My loyalty is sensitive so please don't cross me
I came to redeem myself
All I need is God's help
It's a millions of miracles
Show me the real you, the real truth

[Verse: Zacari]
You love it when I fall on my face
Don't act so surprised when
I'm in, oh, my rightful place
Ain't it righteous? Amen (amen)

[Chorus: Zacari]
This time around, there's time to turn it around
This time around, there's still time to turn it around
This time around, there's always time to turn it around
This time around (this time around)

Kendrick Lamar:
What inspired me as a kid really was, uh, illustrating my thoughts on that sheet of paper

Life's to me like a box of chocolates
(?) something for something, that's the obvious
Flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Biting my style, you (?)
Come from the same blocks where they pick cotton
Oh, you forgotten, ah, forget it
That life ain't sane

You see gangbanging, drug paraphernalia. You see things from the streets. So what you gon' do? You gon' find something that you love to do and have a passion for it, or you gon' stay, you  know, mingling in the streets until something major happens

So the moment I defined myself and freed myself was the time I locked myself in the studio and said, "You need to do music."

Tonight's for everybody, understand me
The plan B is the one in your hearts
This here is family, Kendrick Lamar
Words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
That's family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came into Compton to accomplish one thing: reign supreme
Raise a king named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for "King" and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochee to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well, I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
But it's muscle in my heart
I stare in the eyes of Mozart and tell him I'm the genius
I love myself, really love myself
And I means this with all sole
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating
With the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
I tell 'em, "Get out my wallet and passion in your logic"
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn, that boy good
I'm bright as Thomas Edison but I'm Gucci Mane in the hood
I stood alone for so long, prolonged my whole career
But now I'm here, you can shoot shots and cheer
Because I am, we are Kendrick Lamar

Getting into that success level where you can go back to your neighborhood and people feel like, you know, uh, they look up to you. Sometimes the most riskiest things you can do can end up being, you know, the most important. Yeah

Kendrick Lamar:

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah...
Hit the East Side of the LBC
On a mission trynna find Mr. Warren G
When I jumped off the porch, I was forced into last resort
Of a typical short end, of course where that took us course
Hoarse for yelling out Demons that fought inside of me, talk society how to rejoice
Killers aside of me, privacy obviously was lost
Fraud, Piracy of the streets of my Odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
A good kid in a mad city slightly annoyed
I walk out the street with no heat and wanted to beef when i"m just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinner smelling the stars squeezing
Pillars stumbling straight to my melon apparent reason
Probably because i'm a cousin, cousin of blood that blooded in public
And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't' no friend of me, instead of Kendrick i'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, sure, if that's your remedy
Fair enough, i got enemies, but guess who bang?
But that's the repercussion like when your cousin is cussing a blood and your by yourself at the Compton parade
Good kid, mad city, life or death, is you with me?

[Chorus]
See, I was brought up different
Whatever that my pops say, fasho I listened
You said you did dirt, but I can jig it
It don't deserve you, if you wasn't born in it
(??)
I swear we gotta fast forward (Fast forward, fast forward)
(??)
I swear we gotta fast forward (Fast forward, fast forward)

[Pusha T - Verse]
Valentino summers and wave runners
Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug Dealers Anonymous
How many Madonna's can that Mazda fit?
My brick talk is more than obvious; it's ominous
Garage is the Phantom; ghouls, ghosts, and goblins
Blonde-mohawk the collection, I'm Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
'Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
Hat trick under my mattress, [?] stop still
Has a(n) astеrisk after it
After all, I can make a call
I can baptizе a brick as I wash away my sins like a Catholic
Who the fuck can't master this?
America's nightmares in Flint
Children of a lesser god when your melanin's a got a tint
And I can't even mention what I sipped or what I spent
'Cause my name and 18 wheelers is evident
I put my boos in them Cruise Collections
Life's a bitch, A-to-Z on her shoe collection
Take your pick; paid in full like 86 G's on my body
The new Gucci has less monogram, God's got 'em
Let he without sin cast the first stone, so I built that all glass quiet-level first home
Shadowed all your misconceptions, hold all them missing weapons
You thought I would miss my blessing
The ultimate mis-direction, yeah!

[Chorus]
See, I was brought up different
Whatever that my pops say, fasho I listened
You said you did dirt, but I can jig it
It don't deserve you, if you wasn't born in it
(HO NIPSLE??)
I swear we gotta fast forward (Fast forward, fast forward)
(HO NIPSLE??)
I swear we gotta fast forward (Fast forward, fast forward)

[Verse]
I can tell you what it is
I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck the stage name that-the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify with within this business
Just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
Weighin' my options, pick up a bible or a strap
I never killed a man, I never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
But, this monkey on my back: y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
So, just to get a dollar, would I sell my soul?
I look the Devil in the eye, and tell him, "Hell, no"
They say "Anything worth having is worth the wait"
But I want the world tell me how long that takes
It's no time like now
I could cut my patience short or give 'em some more gowns
I don't even want the crown, I just want the peace of mind
And nigga, when I get it, you won't get a piece of mine
Won't you mind your own business!
A rich nigga buy anything you sell 'em
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell 'em
Well, I'm a broke nigga, but still I wouldn't listen to you even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga (Tuh!)

Classic Timeless rules forever

[Talking]
By the time I start writing when I was thirteen I knew from the jump I wanted something that was original that was classic

[Freestyling]
I freestyle over anything give me a instrumental
I bet I make bells ring
I bet I make birds sing
It sounds that good
I'm so street and I'm so hood
And I'm intelligent and I'm special and I'm heaven sent
Haha

When you think about rhymes and style you always want a classic feel so my first introduction to a classic shoe was the moment I stepped in school and said, I want to put something down on paper. I started writing. Everyone in the classroom was wearing Reebok classics

Hip-hop was more than just the music. It was part of culture. It was part of havin' style it was part of a whole graffiti and arts

Hot off the press
Hot off success
Look how I dress free, me
Reebok complete

[Pre-Chorus: BSmyth]

You say you want some breakfast, let me open wide
Eat it up, tickle up my spine
Run back, side to side, stick shift, overdrive
Boy, you tryna give that pussy new interior design
Bangin', bangin', wake up in it, I'ma put my back into it
No Netflix, we makin' movies, I'ma let you watch me do it

[Verse 2: LightSkinKeisha & BSmyth]
I get those goosebumps every time
You hit it from behind, the way we bump and grind
You love the way I grind on that dick, grind on that dick
Yeah, climb on that dick, glide on that dick
Big titties in the front seat, ass in the back
Throw it like a pitcher, baby, hit it with your bat
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt) I be on that freak shit
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt) Bust it for no reason

Bring it on you busters, watch you niggas flee
He's making a killing off putting his life on Pro Tools
The new school, the rap version of Aaron Jones
The hair and bones
To rock Jane, to cocaine, to spit game
To get us, they get tucked
Nigga don't get gassed up, might get blast up
It ain't about being tough, but even in them interviews
Every time you see me got a semi in the tuck
Chickens at the label like leave the gat at home
You know those Hip-Hop cops got it in for you
They got it in for us, but they ain't bending us
We got a infra strong enough to flip a code

No nice clothes were caught in the morning
Trying to crease my jeans
I remember me as a young buck
Trying to put work in
Same pants for two weeks
But I would iron the dirtiness real
Back then the battle was urgent
Now days you see me in the same shit
I didn't have the detergent
I'm riding Six and Park
You used thought you knew like the back of your hand
Turn around and give the glove
So I learn to stay with you
Cause when your wheels look like Terminator 2
It'll turn your man into a hater, true
Hopefully the pain will stay past then
As what's to come, it's better that what has been
Think about it, but if his problems keep playing, solvem'

Niggas know me well, can't move me with ease
Go in your pockets at, take all your cheese
That's how I make my profit, rob y'all when 'ya sleep
It's the black Clark Kent, Superman of this rap shit
Play Superman when them gats spit, and them Kryptonite hollowtips
Make you backflip, then chaperone you to a casket
It's real
Goddamn, there's no man like I am that can compose the skills of a genius
I'm not Hip-Hop's future, I'm Hip-Hop's Fred Krueger
A new nightmare, I'm right there
With the head of Lucifer killing you demons
God's children, what can you do to us?
This rap shit ain't new to us
Been real, since Mama was stroller scootin' us

Iced out, Veggies shining maybe then you'll know my name
Shout out my homies on it, specially from California
Man I be killing tracks, twenty years old writings on it
I got the connect, it's time to get a lick
I put my niggas on then we generating checks
This slow as a cancer, I need a sponsor
Or go to Avery's college and try to be a scholar
But the thing about it, got no dollars got no knowledge
I pray "God help me prosper, keep me from imposters"
I applied to school just so I can have some options
I need a couple mil, I'm trynna do it big
If I never get my chance least you all know I live, I live
Peas and Carrots, that's my niggas
We blew up, you a eyewitness
My broad put his finger on her trigger
If any of you niggas come try and get us
But only call upon the shit you want
She lookin' good and she got a donk
I'm a take her down and then wake her up
And then let her know that I had enough
[Verse 2: C-San]
Rollin' round the city with the homies in the Fo' Do'
Number 9 Jays matching perfect with the polo
Boxing out haters in my city like ?polo?(pogo?)
Girls with seven D's, double D's taking photos
Grab them cameras, let you know you ain't dealing with no amateurs
Ask your girl, bet she'll tell you all about my stamina
On the grind to the come up
Name through the city got me buzzin' like a liquor but I never pick a blunt up
Fly chicks all in the whip, you will never be ?
But she really just admiring the come up
Funny what these chicks'll do when you making moves
I had em' propped for Veggies, picked em' up right after school
This pimpin' nigga
Gems drop, better listen nigga
Chasing all these hoes will leave you cold
Better pay attention nigga
Flashing lights, lavish nights
If I hit it once, I'mma hit it twice
Cold game
Do it for my niggas trynna maintain
Got girls blowin' like coal train
Throw a couple in the air like Soul Plane

[Hook 2x]
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico
[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Hit the eastside, the hoes call me Domasito
Crenshaw nigga, from Vernon ave up to Pico
We just getting money, I barely got time to eat though
Josh that's my people, Carrots get all the freaks though
Ridin' Round Town, I'm in the back while she's driving
Take me anywhere you wanna go, just surprise me
A lot of niggas hating, I'm just now realizing
Your girl legs I will be dividing
Her pussy be open, my dick just be hiding
We just on the coasters, my niggas be riding
Everywhere I'm going, girls be so excited
I went to your showing, no hoes got invited
Come put out the beat, that shit got ignited
My vodka's from Poland, I'm not the politest
I might grab your ass, I know you finn' to like it
I told you I can't drive bitch, police done took my license
So I be Just...

[Hook]
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the...

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
And they all wanna feed my ego
When they wanna lay up in the front seat do'
With the feet up, 'Beep Beep' in the Regal
Baby hurry up, 'Skeet Skeet' she go deep throat
Then I'm rolling in the wind, Chi Town
Top down in the summer time, brand new number 9's
I be lovin' that crap like it's Cee-Lo
They be lovin' my crack man I'm Nino
She know that I see more C notes than you
Give me Chemo, home sick and I need help
But I hardly medicate myself, I doctor everything that I do
I've been the one, since I was one
This game I got, it weighs a ton
These bitches go, these bitches come
She scream some more every time she cum
Orgasms and a lot of Champagne
Back spasms and diamond rings
Diamond cut, nigga it's no cut
When I yell "HiiiPower, TDE Gang"
I'm ridin' round, I'm ridin' round
The corner from success, and I made a left
Then I got it right, now fuck your life bitch Kendrick's next
I'm talkin' dick in the whole world
Your Ex and your new girl
Shit you nothin' new girl
There's better bitches than you girl
As I ride around, I'm right around the corner from success
Then I made a left and got it right
Now fuck your life, my dick is wet. Pause
[Casey Veggies talking]
Hold up man this my song, let me take it back real quick for ya'll

[Verse 5: Casey Veggies]
It's young Veggies
I prefer to just get the dome
Little niggas was at home
I was grindin' 4 years on my own
Don't act like you can't see a nigga
In your past life you can't be a nigga
You can have an approach, make a lot of money
In the end you still gonna be a nigga
To the government, my covenant
Got attitude no Eazy-E
Po po's ain't seeing me
Four shows and I need some tea
Young and going through puberty
But in high school man I made the G's
My legal grind gon' take me far
I'm a porcupine I'll stab a heart
I shine hard off my heart
Gimme me the light like Sean Paul
She'll drop it low for this young nigga
Girl you should be askin' to run with us
Baby girl I'm just one nigga
I can only chill and have fun with ya
Big dreams make big figures
I'll wrap the city like big tigger
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
Going down and I'm livin'
In life you always get a choice
And I chose the right at that wisdom
Gone

[Hook 2x]
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico

[Outro: Casey Veggies]
Ah, the swagger
Dollar after dollar
Keep a bad chick with me
And I always pop my collar
If she ever got a problem
Get rid of her ass to solve it
Smash her at night
Then I kick her out in the morning
SWAG!
Swag
Swag

[Intro]
Alright, here we go, third take
Real quick, Ali, mm

[Chorus]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yessir (Amen!) Church
(He dead!) I killed him (Amen!) Bitch

[Verse 1]
And this is rigor mortis, and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus; the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead! Amen!) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrities, this is studio felony
Ferragami, so many, and cool enough for the '70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch you been living in debt with me
Dead 'em all, and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
That say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do

[Chorus]
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I killed him
(He dead!) Hmh, hmh, hm (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Verse 2]
I rapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster?
Your hypocritesque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
I'm persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of y'all fucks never could hassle me
And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see

[Chorus]
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Pull up and park in my Caddy
That's when I fuck it up badly
Frankly, I'm happy to tell niggas
"Have manners 'front they daddy"
I carry the Anthony Mackie
And put holes in you badly
Fuck sending you off in a hearse
I'll send you off in a taxi
Have you bloody leaky looking like you tampon or maxi
Retaliation talk (Shut the fuck up nigga!) Exactly
Nasty the classy the flashiest how I'm on it
Don't ask me no kind of questions and mention
I'll leave your face in a pantry
And gladly lump up your shit and bumpin' your face up like acne
Break your teeth, replace them with veneers bigger than Little Scrappy
Feeling like growing my dread again
Letting my shit get nappy
Throw me on a New York fitted
While reppin' like I'm a Yankee
If they wanna front then I hit em and I tap em
Eat a nigga's food like its a scampi
When it come to bitch niggas, I'm a little bit a racist
Governor Pataki
Papi, here to massacre aunti
Now pops was a little bit manly, fuck all that aiming
I'mma hit him in the front, hit him in the back
So substanc-y
Then I gotta Bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-beat a nigga leave him in the alley
You don't really really know how you niggas always be making me aggie
Organs in your drawers now you wearing your pants saggy
Haggling niggas with scriptures I'm spittin, you should be happy
Gradually when I hit you I split you and leave you sadly
In a situation lay you out flatter than chicken patties
It's the God, you hear me talking whenever you hear the raspy
And when it comes to murkin' something you should never put it past me!
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] :
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) Amen

[Intro]
Here comes a change and another change
And another change and another wave of change
Like a heartbeat coming from another world

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
I burn, bush on Sinai
None higher than I
Roll up, like that good kush that they've been smokin' since 5
Pull out like 2 9’s and I aim it dead at they eyes
And tell them lyrically motherfucker you have met your demise
Jedi, the black chapter
Like the bone in they thigh been hip to the game niggas lame
I am July working my fire
Know to fucking light up the sky
UFO with the flow, I’m like that alien guy
ET, high power, I three, I see
With it, lyrically niggas never touching us sick
A cell, hard to pass me, I’m too cold they ain’t well
I gel, with black hippie Monáe Janelle
A droid, roid, hemmed in they pit, niggas smell
The shit coming through, silver-back monkey at zoo
Bananas, I've been really forreally like a milli leroux
East side, now show respect cause the west coming through
It’s like lyrically Big and Pac, man if they friendship was cool
Motherfucking jams we making until the skies turn blue
My view is by Badu sitting at window seats
Lookin' down, word to Nate Dogg, and all dog pounds they he peep
We high, touching the sky now and the rest of 'em sheep
I’m that ba-ba black one now standing out in the heap
Buh-baa, but brag, I part rappers, fingers on Chad
From the rad and so-so's I top, most niggas that lag
Behind, never they catch up like the britches they sag
Close to fallin' off, I'm in front I'm the jag on the jag
Catch up, catch us, good luck like clover niggas now gag
Throw up your 3 for K-dot, now wave 'em repping the flag
Jamla, camera, I snap like ginger cookies, a monster with stanzas
Stand us, they can't Walker Texas, I’m rangers at ranches
Out of their ranges
Kickin shit up now these niggas can’t stand up
Sit down I'm too fuckin' profound, I'm rap Diddy to strangers, I’m gone

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Look into the new vision in mind
Kendrick divine intervention, I drop a jewel and the diamonds glisten
Don’t chime in my business you’ll run into atomic collision
You knew my colonic was different
I’m shitting on shit that was shifting your image
I rhyme like a chemist
I rhyme like the Guinness book of records was records I written
I rhyme and you mimic the rhyme that I didn't like when I did it
You bit it
Your bite is so big you need bridges at night, and 9th can admit it
The pint that Hennessy spiked this minute a mic and a menace
And time is dependent on what you pretending to be
Your grind is diminished by me and mine is the menace the preach
I'm findin my soul on this beat definin' my flow
And you know I fold any foe at defeat its 4 in the morning
Formin a George Foreman that's a grill when I speak and I'm on it
Till the mill in the jeep then living orders
I feel like feets of the fortune of gorgeous of bitches I see when recordin sheesh

Drugs and girls

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul, Kendrick Lamar, & Sample]
Ugh, show me some love, my love
Last time I checked, you loved my love
Place nothing above my love
If you leave, come back, like above your butt
No ifs, ands, or buts
You're sufficient, but I still wanna fill you up
When loves runs high (Ha!)
Just when you thought enough was enough
I'm a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch
Every part of your body, tie you up and get naughty
Ho, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers
All the ladies wanna kick it with Mr. Miyagi
Pull up, pull up, bring it back, come, rewind (Hey!)
I wanna touch up and down your spine (Hey!)
When loves runs high
Hmm, a perfect 10 living on Cloud 9

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Sample]
I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
Anything that can get me out of my mind
I'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially
When loves runs high

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Group Vocals]
Now, everybody in the place!
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
Do it 'til you can't feel your face!
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug
Now, everybody in the place!
Toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke, toke
Do it 'til you can't feel your face!
Chug, chug, chug, chug
Now stop... and just groove!

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q + Jay Rock]
Ugh, faded off life
See the dopeman, time to get right
Open up a Bud Light
Don Julio, Coronas, comas
Bad bitches, bad bitches
Call up bad bitches, bring your friend to be a witness, ugh!
When loves runs high
Tch... Whatever that mean
Ugh, need a shot, you the vaccine
You pumping through my veins, I'm a crack fiend
Ugh, you're the crack, ugh
Drive your ass all night, meet the chauffeur
Bend you over in a rover, it's over
Never sober, my cup runneth over
When loves runs high
Better know, girl, you fucking with a soldier

Blunts and broads
Drinking on liquor that's hard, oh my God
Baby tryna grab my drawers
They call me "Dozer," I knock down walls
José, that's my homie
Yeah, I hear you calling Earl in the hallway
When loves runs high
I gotta come down just to party
I'm turnt up, maxed out
Willie Manchester, blow your back out
Baby girl, my advice—better back out
Got that dope stick, I'm the crack house
Listen, ma, I got a role you can act out
And then, like Prince pants, get your ass out
I don't need a princess, I need a mistress
Who's sticking dick in a damsel in distress

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, & Sample]
I like to drink all the time (Soul!), fuck all the time
Anything that can get me out of my mind

[Intro: Ash Riser]
We're far from good, not good from far
90 miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top-down, screaming "We don't give a fuck!"
Drink my 40 ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
'Cause the kids just ain't alright

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
Oh, shit nigga, somethin' 'bout to happen, nigga, this shit..
Nigga this sound like 30 ki's under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to vigilante, 80's so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightnin' bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travellin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the 90's
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me that
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & RZA]
Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch I love it
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a 40-ounce to the neck and
In retrospect I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas
I tell you mothafuckas that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a 64, better know how to drive it
I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration
Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan, rake the leaves off
Your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)
He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)
He copping some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
Newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger
With calendars, cause your date's comin'
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & RZA]

I guarantee your bitches heard about me with the urgency
She just wanna suck success, smoke turtle
We call it turtle 'cause it's green and it makes you move slow
Donatello, green or purple ain't no suckas' in my circle
Money on my mental, heavy on my grizzle
This ain't a movie, they'll rob you for your Dinero
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
In the middle of the Warzone I be on
Sippin on a big bottle of that burgundy
Mutha'fuck yo styrofoam
Big barrel, baritone
And It sound like Barry White
And it boom like an eight-o-eight
Turn yo' ass to a parasite
On the freeway I rock to the snare
Don't get me out my loop my nigga
A bad bitch I ride with a pair
Like the fruit my nigga
The paparazzi gone shoot my nigga
But I don't pay em' no attention, Im a put em' in detention
Head of the class, head in the e-class with the tint missin'
You said, I know that you said
More company? I probably don't need it

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6th

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping?
If what I write down don't collect this very moment
Then I'm on it, no question
In the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet
This is me, frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo
Track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?
"I thought you had a show?" Well, my nigga, I guess I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curb-serving, or I might be in your store boosting
Two-elevens with Mac-11s like fuck Hip Hop
Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
Or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
Then expand to the Hoover dam, water, sherm
Contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
You'll know I always had a passion for riddling, writing
But lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially, so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga, "Front me, let me put it on the strip"
Then give it back when I think about the consequence
Shit...

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
There are times, when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
Special for you, and me yeah
I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances
Before they pass, they pass, they pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You've got to look at the other side

Run, nigga, run, you'd better get away
Run, nigga, run, a pater-roller'll catch you

Nigga run, run so fast, caught in the head of a hornet's nest
Run, nigga, run, a pater-roller'll catch you

Nigga run through the field, a black snake caught him by the heels

Oh, nigga run nigga flew, and the bears will get a white man too

Run so fast, nigga won't steal, i caught three in my cornfield
Run, nigga, run, a pater-roller'll catch you

Run, nigga, run, a pater-roller'll catch you

Hey Mr.Patty roller dont catch me, catch that nigga behind that tree
Run, nigga, run, a pater-roller'll catch you

Run, nigga, run, a pater-roller'll catch you

[Verse 1]
Gloomy on sunny days, shadows no house or trees
Prayers not close to me as I bow down and take a knee
Hell goes far as the eye can see, hoodies and weaponry
Naive to being free, locked up, we chasing keys
How your eyes investigate us, while we look up to entertainers
Ball players, pistol bangers, big brothers, uncles, uncles
Betrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle
Huddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land
As I clench down upon this trigger, the burn fucking burn
Every step to getting deeper, survival my main concern
Marinating in Satan's sweat, take a sip of this holy water
Hoping God still keep me blessed, with a dark shield for my armor

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar + ScHoolboy Q]
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah

[Verse 2]
Promises, man, I promised, none of them goals accomplished
Promises, man, I promised to be loyal and honest
Promises, man, I promised, lied on separate occasions
Promises, man, I promised, my promises is aging
Hennessy what my system like, feeling like Superman
I might crip tonight, I bring loss to life
A gruesome site, look who don' got involved
It's no different from wars, it's kill or be called upon
Feeling teary eyed, thinking I've gone too far
Ask God for forgiveness, shit I doubt he heard me at all
They say clean your hands before you eat, rinse your sins with prayer
But I've done did some things I don't think I could ever wash away

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar + ScHoolboy Q]
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah
Whoo, woah-woah, whoo, woah-woah

Sail
Sail

[Bridge: AWOLNATION]
This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my A.D.D. baby
This is how an angel cries
I blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my A.D.D. baby

[Hook: AWOLNATION]
Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & AWOLNATION]
Uh huh, Kendrick Lamar (Sail)
I look in the mirror and nothing's familiar I stare
I look in the mirror and nothing's familiar I dare
For you to say that you're familiar with character which this I have
Mental is riding a big yellow cab
Telling the driver to press on the gas
Yell at them until I get there
You could just love me and leave me alone
I'm warning you though if you love me you never go wrong
We can explore heavy feelings of breathing mother nature's air
Feelings of knowing I'm rather rare
But there's a reason for all of my madness the gladness I am that you're here

[Hook: AWOLNATION]
Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
This is how I show my love
Let my soul sail before I'm washed up
Gotta drop down thank God above that I'm high enough to give the sky a touch (uh)
Maybe it's my A.D.D. I'm on the move like a real estate agency
Century 21, 21st Century bare the birth of my history there can only be one (uh)
This how I show my love
Let my soul sail like Miss Aiko
Sacrifice my life just to free the people the Jesus sequel (uh)
So many admire us 'cause they can't see through our iris's
I got an eye for her, I got an eye for her, I got three eyes
I need three brides

Five-star suite, you ain't know, suga? (You ain't know, bitch?)
I’m chilling, bumping Anita Baker
Caked up, they wonder why I don’t need a baker
But really though, I just need a hater
So I ask 'em for their number when I see a hater
Ask Obama if I don’t know about presidents
Keep them dead motherfuckers resting in my money clip

Got a bitch to twist a blunt and pop a nigga collar, too
Who that nigga standing over there? That’s that nigga, Q
What it do? That's wassup, bang this in your Tonka truck
Everybody rocking Chucks and pistol packing, that’s a must
Sagging and my ass showing, mami and the cops knowing
All I wanna do is smoke a blunt, let it bump

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Yeah, I'm looking in the mirror and the nigga said, wassup, Rock?
And that nigga looked back at me and said, boy, you certified
Took my '87 Regal, put it in a chop shop
Stash spot, .45, run up, you gonna die
Looking for a pretty bitch who can twerk it and throw it back
Nigga diss me, no, I ain't missing, I'm throwing shots back
Jay Rock, top cat, and I'm still a Top Dawg
Boxed in that Porsche box like I'm fighting southpaw

When you see me in your town, say wassup

To chase and face my desires I'm racing till' I expire
Aspire to be the great
The greatness is within me just pending until its escape
The feeling is splendid it's fibbing and beating the case
But wait there's a splinter in the splendor cause you just Can't
Please everybody and your adversaries want you to break
That's when you look at yourself in the mirror and then you say
It's me myself and I and I'mma try even if they hate
Try offending anything I confront and give my heart to the people
And turn my back on the government put my all in this music
Survival tactics I practice I keep my eye on the Judas
Counterattack with compassion
And Loriana is my angel, yeah Loriana is my angel
Wish I had heaven on earth to personally see your halo
Sick of feeling like God picking on me
Scarring all the stars in my galaxy
Soul![Intro/Hook]
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what’s the, what’s the, what’s the scenario (x2)

[SchoolBoy Q]
Crept up in this muthafucka soundin like a stun gun
Fresh up out the hotbox got me smellin' like marijuana
Flyer than a Desert Eagle when it’s starin’ down lookin’ at my people
Shootin muthafuckas down just because I’m evil
Live and direct like Cable TV pay-per view pay me
Who Q? Ha-chu yeah blessed it, beautifulest tune
You’ll tune on the record
Everything is coke so I kick like Liu Kang
Thinkin you can really get with this man you playin
Get you a platoon, yeah floatin’ like balloons
Get so high got to space then I shitted on the moon
Went into a rage now the sun won’t shade Mars
Know I got bars so I’m aimin for the stars
Everyone applaud, praise to the genius
Never would like to let the hoes bow to the penis
Feenish

[Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick relentless in other words a dentist
I’m in they mouth without a doubt
It’s funky grab an incent
Grab a honkey, grab a nigga, grab a wetback, grab a chink
Then put ‘em in a box like Michael and Leon Spinks
Then tell me what you get for cultures feeling me
As if they was blind and braille on my sleeve
Peace, to hip-hop, down to earth
Word to the voice of Chris Rock
Can I rock like a '88 Camaro and T-Top
Whoa, the scenario seem to flip like an aerial
As I dip like a pull-up bar at the gym
Won’t you witness the gem
I’m a troop from Angola and
You a cop on patrol that’s trying to Axel Foley
As dumb as Napoleon Dynamite and I’m quick to blow up then BOOM
Combustible like flames and petroleum
[Jay Rock]
It’s Jay Rock
Niggas know my status
Flip flows like a gymnast on a apparatus
Leave yo body in pain if I hit you with this ‘matic
Don’t even speak if you ain’t talkin cabbage
Loyal to the cash, thinkin’ ‘bout a marriage
Committed to the block that’s somethin’ niggas cherish
Hmm.. if you dissin’, you missing Parish
Then I’m on a mission, fishin Paris
Lookin’ at some dimes, go get your cameras
Black Hippy emcees and we got hammers
Gang member slash rap nigga
The name’s Rock, all the hoes call me that nigga
Never relax, never do that
Soon as you relax, them lames is stealin’ ya swag
I’m the truth in the booth I’m killin’ the track
To the point of no return no bringin’ It back
I’m so fluent on the beat just spittin’ the facts
You lames lyin, think you chief
You bridgin’ the gap
I’m the fountain of youth, you niggas is tap
Like bugs in the phone, you niggas is wack

[Ab-Soul]
Enter the mind of the utmost divine
Heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
Twilight zone, war with the star
Hans Soulo
Top Dawg, not Todo, notch logo
On my hand, knock you out
Goddamn!
Say I’m not lethal, inhumane
Squeeze juice out a beetle
Offended John Lennon come to cloud 9
That’s where the cockpit is
Me and Kendrick Lamar startling all contenders
ScHoolboy Q, gangsta with a USC student IQ
And Jay Rock a fuckin’ fool
You make the wrong fuckin move
He like “DON’T FUCKIN’ MOVE!”
Aimin’ at you with the tool
I’m like what am I to do?
Crazy how the shit we make come out phenomenal
Black Hippy, and as for me I’m the black sheep passin’ weed
To Miss Bo-Peep
Peep!

Go away (far away)
Poverty, jealousy, negativity
Ngith' ak'nandawo la
Go away (far away)
[Verse 2: Mozzy]
I cried when lil' bruh died
Got high and watched the sunrise
Wiggle on 'em if it's one time
They done hung all of my people
I love all of my people
I'm in the slums with all of my people
They tryna tell us that we all equal
We get no justice so it ain't peaceful, yeah
They can bluff you, they can beat you
Paid attorney, we gon' need it
Momma told me there was demons
And she ain't never lied on her Jesus'
She worked her ass off just to feed us
She went to Ross to cop the new Adidas
She used to tap in with all the teachers
They wasn't teachin' nothin', it's no secret
Whole lotta crime, lil' niggas beefin'
We gotta keep it or end up a victim
Trapped in the system, traffickin' drugs
Modern-day slavery, African thugs
We go to war for this African blood
We go to war for this African blood
When I put niggas on, it was all out of love
You was disloyal, can't call it no love
[Chorus: Sjava]
Poverty, jealousy, negativity
Ngith' ak'nandawo la
Go away (far away)

[Verse 3: Reason]
(Season change) You know we off the stove with it
We stove whippin', niggas know we gon' get it
(Season change) Dodgin' cops
Fuck around and get locked, you ain't never comin' home with it
Look, my nigga, I came from the sewer
Don't shit on my past, you ain't come from manure
You see Reason and you see LA
But bitch I ain't come for no ruin
Just know all of my niggas, we struggled for it
Had to hustle for it, cried puddles for it
My pops watched his sister get locked for it
I done seen my niggas get knocked for it like {gunshot}
Gimme that, I carry Del Amo like a piggyback
I carry my city like guilt that ain't got no forgiveness
No way out, shit we locked in the system
Catch a case and they not gon' forgive ya
White skin, you be out before Christmas
Shit, auntie missed eight of those days
Tears from me, had to pray those days
Had to slave those days
Shit, we had to hit up a couple hood giveaways those days
Thank God for every inch that he gave us
Thank God for everything cause he made us
Like when that car bent the block, blat blat
Hit the homie but we made it to ER and he saved us
Thinkin' that he could've died, nigga
We was prayin' to the sky and his momma cried rivers
Healed up, but tough luck, he tried to get revenge
Had to drop, bullets popped and they killed him
Worst part is that it sound so familiar
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I am T'Challa, I am Killmonger
One world, one God, one family
Celebration[Intro]
Seasons change
There's still time for us to run away
Seasons change
There's still time for us to run away
Seaso—

[Chorus]
Closed eyes, that's how you runnin' from your destiny
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out (side, out)
Still runnin', can't let this jungle get the best of me
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Closed eyes, that's how you runnin' from your destiny
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out (side, out)
Still runnin', can't let this jungle get the best of me
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out

[Verse 1: The Game]
I don't read the XXL
Tote a .45 at the church, think I'm destined for hell, oh well
Blood tears off the face of my Jesus Piece
It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets
I'm from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets, born in Blood, nigga
In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga
Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plug nigga
Used to pull the gun out, just because of cuz niggas
Five shots to the head 'cause I'm a Blood nigga
Nuttin' brewing but suwoo'ing where the fuck I'm from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin' down Green Leaf
No peace so don't get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger, we cooking that real beef
Mommas mourning they sons, I'm talking real grief
Real funerals of them lost Juveniles
Trying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh
Say its a blessing when you die in ya sleep
'Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capisce?
I'm sayin', stop playing, wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms, now a casket what he pray in
Compton streets raised me
Can't tell my grandma nothing 'bout her baby, you crazy

[Chorus: Tank]
I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'ma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a Jag
A car for my dogs, with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried, even when it's scary
Skrrt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone is burried
Shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic 'cause rats is what I'm talking about
I'm hearin the sonics of gun fire
The whispers, the silent cries
Even though I know it's an eye for an eye

[Chorus: Tank]
I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'mma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?

[Bridge: Tank]
I was born a soldier, ride or die for mine
Tattooed tears and a lawyer, tried to give me life
Heaven can you hear me? 'Cause I know that hell can
So heaven can you heal me? I'm only just a man, oh

[Verse 3: The Game]
You want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there
Hub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh
Niggas can’t hear you talking from the sky
And only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
2 dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though
Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmother’s prayers saved you niggas I never wanted peace
Los Angeles, I’m the motherfucking King here
No first 48 'cause muh'fuckers don’t sing here, huh

[Chorus: Tank]
I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'ma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?

[Verse 1: Mykestro]
Hey, I hear skills still slept on, maybe I recollect wrong
Maybe me writing in retrospect that kept home at a standstill
Me and my Chevrolet roam
The song of salvation until my larynx gone
Never rigid in resurrection was never set in stone
Plagiarist proof endeavors embedded this alone
The subject at hand as if my predicates on song
Set precedent -- I'm addressing the elements indulged
In finesse, your less eloquent rhetoric is strong
Where I reside at, I see irrelevance condoned by the delegates
Their regression is evident they own
What I been off, fuck it since it's the samaritan's I sold
I'ma represent for self in detrimental tone
And I'm taking the front runner of presidential poles
No arrogance, shit I just got my [?] on
Vulgarity is - the only heir apparent to the throne
Can't run in the Serengeti in the [?]
Young and I'm ions beyond the box
Flow free on, but still will Ghost Recon a cop
So phenomenal by design, we still pushing the envelope
No keyage to vote, but uh, most agree I am hope for the coast
Low key I'm consulting the triage of folks
On me I'm the most slept on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Stepped on, step songs, father of rap songs
Writing my wrongs, writing the book of psalms
This is the word, word to the Holy Quran
Or whatever that's foreign to you
I find it funny that you embracing the storm
Wake up, ring the alarm
Or wake up with a bomb through ya
Its Baghdad, kids with bad dads
Cops with bad badges
Big bullets, no "my bad"'s when them guns shoot you
Mykestro, I might go out as the Mike Jordan
Lacing my Jordans and yelling out ISO
Ike Turner your idol, whip him and bruise him
Stick poison inside of his pipe-hole, sad that you knew him
We influence the heart of thousands
That's nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand but who's counting
Thirsty for success and we drink from the youth fountain
Big-headed tryna stay grounded like a delinquent in middle school clowning
Drowning MCs, they want life jackets
While we swim backwards, we yellin' "nigga please!"
Pay your respect and recognize the alphabet
You can't survive in a room full of Gs
Coached by my Uncle Lil' Mane, I resemble him
They tryna steal the game, and we killing all thieves
Make them draw blood, let them all bleed
Motherfucker die, put a ribbon in the sky, tell Stevie Wonder sing
King of all kings, Joker and new jacks will get dealt with
Royal flush when I drop shit and say these things
Man I lean on them cause half these niggas Maybelline: all made up
I'm about to go dummy on a dummy what-what
Treat some like welterweights stuff in some trunks
Fucking with a giant, I'm Forest Whitaker sparring with some Forest Gumps
What you want!
[Verse 3: Mykestro]
What a dilemma tryna deal in charts
What incentive? See I'ma definitive nigga for starts
No one similar, iller the way I deliver they harp
I be rhythm and riddlin', settin' the symbols and sentiments
Diligence, then again I did administer art
In percentages, this is just another sinister star
So consider this exhibition as a privileged par
And watch the metal arc, lemon my part
Shit's riveting what I've written til a nigga depart
By the dividend, considering the withering of words
Nothing realer than the urge to revisit all the shit I been hearing
Emerge through provision and of nerve
We stern, this here is endearing and deserved
Nothing like yall as far as error is concerned
You don't know about us, then your earrings to the curb
Sermons be piercing to your courage
For real -- Against All Odds -- I'm the fiercest with the term
The nonchalant nod when the iffiness occurs
Hella picky and it's sweated out the prissiest of perms
I walk in the room, bitches Vicky's get submerged
Shit that used to be clear, the vindictive be the blurred
And I ain't satisfied til the dense of me can splurge
At the embassy my enemies can burn
I defer all amenities with hopes that my sins will be adjourned
Niggas diddle my abilities, the remedy concern
We at SkillStillAppeal, let the chemistry converge
And the trilogies, the humility is in the urn
You ain't feeling me, the new humidity is here
I'm so in between being Kenny G and Murs
If shit don't blend like Hennessy and [?]
I encourage infamy, you get an empty me and turn
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I return before tables get turned
It’s my turn, spur of the moment
I re-produce my sperm and try to clone it, stand firm
Bumping The Firm, Phone Tap, I’m on it
I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
You can’t fuck with the horse power, your woofing too much
Y’all bout to hoarse coward, as soon as I buss, pause
You put your hands on a broad and telling me you can brawl
You thought you saw me when you saw Saw, frightening
More reckless than a paisa driving without a license
Hittin’ your new truck then leaving you hiking
They said no, the industry let it go
I cracked the window then hit the back door like trick dices
Stickin’ and movin and movin’ and stickin’ the prices
Uppin’ the ante before I'm a antique, can promise you hear me clear
Even if you eat 3 ears with Tyson
Rippin’ the panties but bootin’ the wammys
They dyke and I’m liking them all, I’m siftin’ through panties
Haters’ll spike it
Voicing opinions but holding laryngitis
See I don’t hear ‘em, I’m a winner by law
Track em down like the subway when they sub-par
Sub-zero everytime I jump in the synagogues
Send the angels, send the God
I can make you look hard, I know
I just let the thoughts take its toll
More sentences than level four yard, Bogard
Go hard, black tar, concrete, Tom Vick times Papi Mason times 3
Uncle Toms need Tums to stomach atomic bombs
Or die from my Wizardry
RZA, GZA, Method Man
I’m a Killer Bee, killer! Be killed, make your embassy yield
This is not your cup of tea, and oh
They say waters run deep, dive in, Bermuda triangles
And you will see us, we must leave dust behind
Emcee’s duck, deduct, revenue declined
When we touch down like a Running Back’s grind
Can you keep up or keep away for keepsake
And [?] fuck!
We must leave dust behind
Emcee’s duck, deduct, revenue declined
When we touch down like a Running Back’s grind
Can you keep up, you keep a safe for keepsake
That ain't safe - Bluh![Intro]
Yeah
Punch what's happening brother?
Niggas be poppin' that shit to me like it's something new to me or something, I tell 'em bout
I tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me nigga
I've been doing this shit since vanguard[?] brother
Antonio what's happening with it?
Niggas hatin' on me but hop right on my dick soon as they see me
Soon as they see me they be like

[Verse 1]
What up Dot?
That's what they tell me every second around the clock
Every time I clock in, rappers checking they watch
Studio paid for, hours unlimited
Assholes, how many MCs I knock off they payroll
How many God MCs I knock off they halo
Hip-hop ain't dead, consumers changed up
Rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
I stay low like my socks under my ankles
Play the back like a turtle shell, know well
That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit
So I fail, guess what? I don't even trip
Just like that, crush your little battle raps, punchlines
I did that in 99' you think it's a gold mine
When you think of one, you think you hot but I think you done
Like Queens New York slang, look what the killer brung
Machine guns to a fight, fucking right
Pay your bills or I'm turning out your lights, good night
I shatter niggas dreams, thinking they the West Coast kings
'Till I drop like visine
Tell a nigga quick it ain't always what it seems
Like the stitching on swap meet jeans
I'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper
Snuff him like a rude capper, got a cool bladder, but I'm pissed off
At ya
[Hook]
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, (are you not entertained?)
Body any nigga that wanna holla' my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up

[Verse 2]
Nigga said he'd snatch my chain in the streets, what chain?
I barely wear jewelry, so I ever had one
You barely see it on me, and if I ever had a gun
You wouldn't know it's on me, so snatch it and then you done
I'm in the studio just sipping on Parmesan
Thinking about who could fuck with Kenny and parlor sons
I live this shit, try stop me, you won't live to shit
Probably catch four between your abdomen
Next time you see me, don't ask me who I'm collabing with
Between me and you, some of the new West is actresses
New hate activists, lowkey can't stand our shit
But still we continue to drink laxatives
Cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget
This is mine don't touch (pow pow), did I stutter?
Catch two, cats knew, I been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo
Yup, you little monkeys know what it do
Come test me
[Hook]
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, (are you not entertained?)
Body any nigga that wanna holla' my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up

[Verse 3]
Dayum, you killin' 'em K-Dizzle
And if you don't kill 'em then you send 'em to hospitals
Sleeping on a reclined bed with a thin pillow
I'm with a white bitch, ass like a black widow
Bet I jumble to the end of my lifeline
So when I die, you can say I balled for a long time
The 08' Frankenstein, beast like Sasquatch
Feet size thirty-six, steppin on Hip-Hop cause that's my bitch
I write a rhyme, then she ride my dick
The girl is mine, I don't know that hoe that you with
You niggas know this, I'm way better than I've ever been
So focused, like a sniper when he zoom in
What's your motives? I bet it's to go against
Or like the GT get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets
I'm the all mighty K, Compton
Rep it 'till my very death day, let the reaper in his face
And recite every song from N.W.A
I pay homage for those great who paved the way
Wait, back to the subject of who's and who doesn't
Do what I do, bluffin' until I touch 'em
Like a masseuse do, nothing compares to me
But the throne, so tell 'em bring the chair to me
I'm a red bullet, small nigga
But I handle y'all niggas like I'm eight feet tall
Nigga[Intro]
This, this, this
Should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential

Life’s a bitch, life’s a bitch
But I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
My dick hard, her pussy wet

[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar]
And I’m born with my dick in the earth
You can tell me how much am I worth
I’mma die with my heart on my sleeve
Many die on their hands and their knees
And I’m takin’ whatever I need
And I’m raping the government fees
And you’re wasting your time
And I’m speaking my mind on whatever I think
And I think that I’m Richard Pryor
With priors of 32 fiends
And that means that I hear for higher
Tell me why are you starin’ at me?
Matta fact, man, your eyes is wired
You inspired by Kendrick the king
Maybe it’s ’cause I’m living my dream
Man, I sing what I’m living about
And the words that come out of my mouth
They requires a random routine
Of being organic granite
Then my access is granted
To represent the shit that I conceive
And I guarantee that I’mma bring
My mind, body, soul
And I sold all these records off bein’ myself
And I wish you can do the same thing, man
It’s easier than a stripper
Or tyin’ a baby shoestring, you stringing along
And really why you writing a song?
Your passion for music is never in sync
No secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
And they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit?
You'll get relief
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
My dick hard, her pussy wet
I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)

(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar]
And I see that you envy of me
Enemigos don’t prosper
Better yet, they do die eventually
If I’m at the event you will leave
‘Cause you know and I know that
I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I’m near you
But I don’t hear you, can you at least breathe?
With an oxygen mask, and
The masses keep saying I’m speaking for them
And if you can imagine my madness
Then you can see where I’ve been
And the places the Louis has been
And I swear I been doing this when
You was in pajamas, watching B-Barney and Friends
And you couldn’t harm me even with ten
Weapons of your choice riding in
Army tanks, you shot blanks
And I shot back, make your duplex bend
What the fuck you think? If I don’t think
Then I’m right back where the city sin
What the fuck you drink?
Thinking I can’t write these raps in the Lions’ Den
When I hear that you lyin’, then?
It’s murder she wrote, ain’t no hope
You go downhill, man, where’s your slope?
Get thrown downhill tied to a rope
Tell the world to put intervals
Man, I swear this the anecdote
And they tell me that life is a bitch
Who gives a shit when you know?
[Hook]

And I see that you envy of me
Don’t prosper, better yet, they do die eventually
Cause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen

(Hi, ho!)
(Bye, ho!)[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Yeah, Los Angeles, "Welcome to the Terrordome"
City of Satan, angels can't even get along
No lie, my town covered in darkness
Hoping that the sun just shine on us
Rolling up the kush, now I'm letting my mind wander
Into another place, I ain't tryna go down under
Life is like a race and we all tryna finish it
Shit never fair, strays hitting the innocent
The good die young where I'm from and it's sad to say
That somebody gotta die today
Tomorrow's never promised, but we living for the moment
Nigga, time never stops, it just keeps on going
Crackers just gave my young nigga four life sentences
Twenty-five times four, nigga, do the math
And the hood never have witnesses
Cause if we did, then them shots gon' blast

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This ain't the way my life bout to end
So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
Give 'em something my people sure to feel
Give 'em something that I know is all the way real
[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Just wakin' up, mind playing tricks on me
Got the fifth on me, gotta take a risk homie
Was a ball player till the coach pissed on me
Keep it real, I could take you down the list homie
Be a tradition, see these Chucks be a mission
Burner be the fuel to the flame, the key to the ignition
If you banging, be serious, boys run up in your pad
Point-blank, period, moms ain't hearing it
Niggas said 'cuz lil nigga got blasted
Oh well, give a shit, shouldn't half-assed it
Only time you with it, when your niggas all tripping
Caught your ass slipping, now I'm stepping up my crip and steady dipping
Riding through the city in lights, living it trife
Wrong intersection, ready to fight
Hopping out with my own agenda, who the contender?
Better hope this motherfucker jam (BLAHH!)

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This ain't the way my life bout to end
So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
Give 'em something my people sure to feel
Give 'em something that I know is all the way real
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, as I'm hearing the first and second verse
I try to analyse the feeling that's felt in the song
I want to tell Rock and Q to go to church
But that's a hypocrite because I ain't been in so long
I stare at the world from a righteous point of view
And realize a crisis coming
Novocain couldn't numb it, the pain is unbearable times two
Let's rally a team, summon, and school the youth
How you feel about it?

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Man, I feel the same way as you
It hurts my soul, like a needle piercing
Through the bottom of my shoe and if you behind bars
Hold your head, pause
And if you in close range with a nigga with a gun in his waist
I pray the intervention is divine
I got a cousin in jail and handful of homies in heaven
But earlier than expected, what the hell?

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This ain't the way my life bout to end
So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
Give 'em something my people sure to feel
Give 'em something that I know is all the way real

[Verse 1]
K.Dot, you know that he's hot
I can do rhythm, hip hop, I can do pop
We talkin' 'bout the black, we talking 'bout the brown
We talkin' 'bout the white, it don't care who you around
It's all about the positivity when you with energy
If you knew me, then you know that God had witnessed me
If you see me then you know you can't intimidate me or be me
You can see we go for the energy
(K104)
K104
Best hip hop and R&B, I be up in your store
You know I'm rocking out, I got my people around me
We in the building and you know definitely you can't down me
And if the children...
(Dede)
And if the Dede, she called me cute
I walked in the building, I said yo, she got on boots
She got on earrings, maybe baby girl got on hoops
She got that long, brown hair, it's wrapped, yeah, she cute

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
He say I'm killing this beat, K.Dot he never been weak
You know I got them flows and plus I've always been cheap
And they talk 'bout strip clubs, I talk 'bout ladies and hugs
We talking 'bout more abuse, we talking 'bout these drugs
We talking 'bout my lady to the right, she real fly
Say your name again, girl, don't be shy
(Lady Jade)
Lady Jade, she aways talkin' 'bout gettin' paid
And the haters they in our way and they getting sprayed
Cause the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
They're always gonna play, play, play, play, play
No matter what they say, say, say, say, say
We're getting paid, boss, paid, boss
What's up?

[Verse 1]
(Bitch)
Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
What you say? Oh, you haven't? Alright, wait, bitch (Yeah)
I want the fade (I want the fade)
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I need the fade, I need my-
We gotta fade
Give me my fade (Fade)
We gotta fade (Fade)
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I, I need the fade, fade
Run me my fade, fade
I can't please everybody, not even me
I wanna please God, but my issues too deep
Bless up, gotta change my number every week
Enemigo, I got 'em hot, I got 'em greased
Shut the fuck up, can't you see my daughter sleep?
Shut the fuck up

[Chorus]
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house

[Verse 2]
Can I vent all of my truth? I got nothin' to lose
I got problems in pools, I can swim in my faith
Cameras movin', whenever I'm movin'
The family suin' whatever I make
Murder his stackin', the president actin'
The government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm brackin'
Look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Woah, woah)
Everything jaded (Jaded)
Team on "Go", let's get it (Get it)
Green gon' grow like veggie (Veggie)
Casino on my debit (Debit)
Fuck your rhetoric, fuck your leverage
Chain no evidence, pass go, motherfuck Confederate
Flags on the back of the medicine
Distributed and peddled in ghettos and
Fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash
Detergent, internet urgent
Time travel in purges, every man and virgin
Fuck chatterin' sermons
Fuck your church propaganda, only God know the answer
We oblige in the cope of state of manic camouflage
Like a sheep so we slide through the cancer, lies and deceit
Vibe like a Phantom, dodgin' police and paramedic retreats
Wanna fuck y'all up for tellin' me "Your life was the one I want"
Been sellin' me concepts ever since I swung
From out of the pro tongue, dedicated myself for recreation
I rest my case, won
[Chorus]
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house[Intro]
One time, reporting live, Compton, California

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that’ll make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she’s compatible, she’s independent
She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions
She's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable
She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me

[Chorus: JaVonté]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm
Abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear
View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property
She order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center
Invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me
[Chorus: JaVonté]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
We lose touch, separated, years pass, I’m outdated
She’s dating one of Hollywood’s famous entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot ‘em out shopping, Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads when a famous actor loves you, Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm
She waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually it’ll come to pass, and she’ll need me
I need her, we need we

[Chorus: JaVonté]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain’t hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

[Intro: Female]
I miss you (I miss you, I miss you)
Where you been? (Where you been?)
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, I need you
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, come back to me
Come back, I need you in my life (Come back)
I miss you, I miss you, come back to me, I miss you

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
What's up baby? (What's up baby?)
It's been a while (Been a while)
You been good? (Been good?)
I've been around (Uh)
Different girls (Where?)
Different towns (Yeah)
To keep it real (Keep it real)
You missing out (Uh)
I’m on board, next city (Onboard, next city)
Random call, text with me (Random call, uh)
Like, I miss you so much, have sex with me
Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me
She like fuck that (Fuck that)
I don't care Dom (Care Dom)
So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom (Fair Dom)
Meet me here, where Dom? (Meet me here, where Dom?)
Get undressed, yeah Dom (Uh)
Yeah Dom, what you need?
Some bomb head? A bag of weed? (Bomb head, yeah)
Good food? Japanese? (Yeah, yeah)
That's me on page forty in that magazine
“Dom Kennedy” you need that
She said nobody come close, I agreed back (Uh)
I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weave back (Yeah)
And she need me, believe that (Yeah)

[Chorus: JaVonte]
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What's up love? (What's up love?)
It's been a while (Been a while)
You been good? (Been good?)
I've been around (Uh-huh)
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chows (Uh-huh)
Truant like a student, you the principal (Alright)
Schooled me on timing, we was both shining (Alright, alright)
Like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond (True)
I was Your Highness, you was my queen (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TBS as it was tedious
For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
And come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folger's holsters
By my waistline, shot for your heart and
You called it a hate crime, say you want me back
And your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit
4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?

[Chorus: JaVonte]
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Verse 3: MURS]
I upped and walked out, now she crying 'cause
She need me, I got that Jon Brion love
Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
My heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
There we go again, what the fuck you talking 'bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldn't cop the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
I would say “Yep”, smiling so freely
That was back then, but I bet she still need me
She need me, she need me
She need me, she need me
I would say “Yes”, smiling so freely
That was back then, I bet she still need me

[Chorus: Javonte]
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on



[Intro]
Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, amen

[Verse]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello, my name is Kendrick," she said, "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
"Where you stay?" She said, "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well, is it Compton?" "No," she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, "What you tryna get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
"I wanna come over, what's up?"
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

[Outro]
Please leave your message for three-two-three
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn, I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes
Man, I gotta go up to the county buildin', man, these kids ready to eat
I'm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on your way or what?
I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hoodrats out there, shit
'Specially that lil' crazy-ass girl Sherane
And plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain't gon' pass to the next grade
Eleventh grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Your daddy callin' about some damn dominoes (Let me holler at him)
He want to holler at you too, go ahead, Kenny, go'n, shit
Hello? Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
(Kenny), What?
I'm on his voicemail, damn fool (Oh), shit
Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I asked you to bring my fuckin' dominoes
Just give me the damn phone, shit, don't hang up, damn, let me
Kendrick, when you get this message, man, call me back (Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard)
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car (And squab, homie)
This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
It ain't all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment, fuck
Fuck some damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
Nobody wanna hear your ass
Matter fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe

[Verse 1: Privaledge]
Yo, I said back up on my body shit
Like I ain't' even body it
The Maserati doors flip back, like a karate kick
I got to get that and party with that
And prolly with the same ones
I come in this game with, Im Mobbin' with
All my niggas thorough from DC, to Cali shit
V-A to P-A, to G-A to D-E, to D-A
Want to catch a nigga, seats and body slit
Circle so tight
Its even harder to get out of it
People say I'm border line crazy
But I'm proud of it,Everyday I'm destined to be
They couldn't swallow it, the hollow shit
A double barrow pump
Will get him out of it
50 Caliber Magazines couldn't model it
A monument, I stand tall
Something like I'm Solomon
Cop is trying to see my Facebook, so they follow em'
All up on Myspace, the fuck out of my face
Been repping 5'2 ever since I was 5'8
5'6 to 5'2 the 40 divide you
According to Sky Blue, now he repping that Piru
Shorty is Pi too, He don't want it with my crew
You ain't' got to fuck with dennis rodman, to die dude
I play the side, they wanted me as pimping
I told I'm a ball, somebody must have been tripping
Somebody must have been sipping
The same niggas looking at me now
Like damn I knew that nigga was shittin'
But I'm spittin' real rap
Got a fake nigga shivering, cause all them punchlines
Hit the skies for the bitching, look at how we living
No chef up in the kitchen, but bitches be over three times a week making chicken
Learn how to rap in the hood, I seen a vision
Everybody slacked in the hood, but I had a mission
Now giving back to the hood is my ambition
So why I live back in the hood, be like an engine
I don't understand that, I don't follow, I be trending
Give a model my opinion, one that I ain't' even have to share
Black Suit, Vladimir, Pen stripe like the magic wear
Thunder Game, They think I'm wearing the magic gear
Court side every game, that ass appear
After the game, Disappear, that's magic yeaah
Still fuck with the same niggas that got me here
And I even on yet, look at how im doin yet
Am I drawn yet? reading paper like a comic
Look at how they made the beat, look at how im on it
Corner-back, I'm a quarter back catching all of that
Wide-receiver still running thinking that I love to bat
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, Hannibal Lector pressure inside my veins
You nothing but a tangible wrestler
Stressed to entertain, I intertwine
With rhymes, while circling candles in the rain
Cause a seance, call my great aunt
And tell her I'm insane
I love the night life, Dracula, e-parasite, where my fangs
Knowing my vice, advice-giving by killers who obtain
Bullets and dice, gamble with it
Put dentures on your name
Price on your head
Sell it for cheap, like an eBay domain
Blucker, ey fucker ! my pedigree might fuck ya
No homo, take yo logo, and yo promo to an usher
To walk it down them church pews
I killed it had a curfew
A 6 p.m, a black p.m
That's all they seen, I tucked a murder weapon in my brain
My nigga, you know the drama I bring
Clinically Saddam Hussein
While fucking on the Dom Hossain
Thas a famous bitch
Now tell me who you hangin' with
Its a Privaledge
To fuck with Kendrick and Kevin durant on some gangsta shit
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Shitted on em
Man
And I take my time, to write these lines
Only aliens can see the signs
Jupiter's intruder, I'm, looking for another universe to climb

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Life make a nigga wanna yell out
Change for that fame, how some niggas turn sell out
Too old for my mama crib, I'm tryin to get the hell out
Stayin' out these cells but we working on that bailout
Help out, please. Sure is hard livin without cheese
Ain't shit in my pocket only these house keys
They pray for a nigga but yet they doubt me
That's why I'm out getting higher than balconies
But no I won't jump, being broke is childish and boy I'm grown up
My money runnin' late tho so boy I won't front
When my paper finally make you should know I'm gonna stunt
So, hard

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
My God, my life is such turmoil
Can't save me tonight cause times is hard now
I know you tell me don't let my guard down
I gotta get it my nigga

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Never believe what they say
Man, I gotta get paid
Dawg it's so damn amazing
How I'mma shock the World
I'mma shock the World
Hell naw I ain't lying
Yea, I gotta get mine
Dawg it’s about time
So I'mma shock the world
So I'mma shock the world

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Stare inside of the soul of Kendrick
While I stare inside the solar, system hopin' I soak up
Enough game to play 3 systems with one controller and remain sane and remain unsober
Was closer to my dreams but reality actually told me hold up
No money in my jeans and my salary said you owe us
Can't pay them taxes, laid on that matress and feel colder than a polar bear
But this bear was in California
So I felt out a pocket and then a piece of lint fell out my pocket
A broke opportunist all in my optics
And you could see it even when I'm Sleep
My screw's loose, I hate when loose change fall in them seats
Because I need every dime like Magic Johnson
Or Hugh Hefner living in his prime
Prime example of youngin' on his grind
This the life of a Compton nigga
I know the vanities of the world like the promise niggas
That's why we crooked, in yo bushes where you find us nigga
You better scramble before you fold like an omelet nigga
This ain't insomnic nigga and that means I don't need Busters to front on me
A Bible in my pocket I'm walkin' like it's a gun on me
So when I catch a fade they know to put more than one on me
Fear no evil, I can still see Regals pullin' up
Niggas tuck like a baby in fetal, position
If you listen you can hear the city needs you
That's what my mind said
But my big head is tellin' me that I'm a black Beatle
Until my number is called and someone yell bingo
A shadow in the dark, park the coupe
Then recoup with the homeless in the park, Kendrick Lamar



[Intro: Punch & Kendrick Lamar]
C4, K.Dot, let's get it
Yeah, Punch wanted me to come right in on the one
I didn't want to
I love this beat
I love it so much, I can just listen to the instrumental
And don't rap
But I won't do that

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Light an incense for little Kendrick, little, oh, Kendrick
Determination, my drive is like a thousand convertible engines
My adrenaline pump the blood of a warrior, chump, the apprentice
Grown to be a man, 21 now, my heart in my hand
Don’t get gunned down, I’m from Compton, bitch
Fuck a 6-4, we hit the kill switch
The other day I seen my nigga Snows in the casket
Darker skin tone, you can only imagine
The type of shit we on, murdered them dumb bastards
Kill 'em inside their kitchen
And then stuffed them inside their cabinets
Death before dishonor, put that on my mama
I'mma ride till I see the promise land, that’s a promise
Llamas in the unfamiliar minivan
More drama only make more problems, but

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Like a black rodeo, .44’s, calicos
Chop 'em up, stop 'em up like a stuffy nose
We supposed to be brothers, motherfuck ya
Tuck your tail, bitch, hell is waiting on ya
While I’m praying on ya
Not on my knees though, I mean preying on ya
I gotta feed, ho, and your death is nutritious to my appetite
After I eat, you’re sure to see afterlife
Jesus Christ, forgive me for my sins
Because when you forgive me, I’m sure to sin again
I guess I’m a sinner, especially when I found out somebody killed my nigga
Nigga, does anybody killer, fuck your creed, race, or color
Son, daughter, sister, mother, brother gotta suffer
Bitch, I’m cold hearted, till my arteries freeze
Please hand me the keys to the G-ride
They outside then

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding

[Verse 3: Punch with Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody get ready for a murder
No more further announcements
Mac-11 bouncing, the murder scene, coroner, yellow tape surrounding
Either I retaliate or find self counseling
Somebody got to die, simple mathematics
Semi-automatic, watch them niggas panic and their hearts perish
Or let's be diplomatic and less melodramatic
Everything is vanity, think Ecclesiastic
But what’s it all for, or what’s it all mean?
An eye for an eye means you and I won’t live to see
As our hearts bleed, we proceed cautiously
Shoot them niggas down consciously, that’s how

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding



Shout out my main fucking dude Kool kid
From Metchern, New Jersey
Shout out
This beat is buzzy as fuck but i don't give a shit

Bass amusing mind waves time age and paradise
The air is nice. I blare and write to the music
Sipping a mystic she got the Derrick Rose lipstick
I hear nothing  but crickets When you kick it what I spit is ballistic
Hitting the spliff stick like a Jarvis green right hook
From queens to red hook, I'm with Vince the price on the white look
I hit a zurg just to get a buzz, graffiti artist type markers
Agrestic the best hits from Mary Louise Parker
Peter, ms Parker she got a fat one
Been writing rhymes ever since capital punishment when platinum
To many styles like Justin I'm on Crenshaw with the TRUTH
I'm garret with the breeze, the air we on is type loose
All of a Sutton you get Nathan, shout out triz Nathanial
Trenta Ochoa that's Daniel chillin with my cocker spaniels
My DJ is divine, after kq Got the words nailed
I take the R TRAIN, hit up the third rail
My souls melodic, you get zero, I'm a blazer
You rhymes are figgy like diggy but you ain't fucking with Mr. Fraser
History knows what's up, niquan knows what's up
Pray to the lord save my life, Luis Lebron knows what's up
Yea you on but you suck my people's make the real shit
When you hear you fear it, you most defiantly can feel it
I'm in the hall like Courtney, support me and my dudes
Shouts to teddy from the BX, let her suck it like DX
I got J like Ms Lynn and Mr Emz
Young talent on the map man where do I begin
Roll call over! but after my man stash the burner
I make her like Lawrence because i turn her
Now we hit the swishes with you sister
Wrapping these bitches like Japanese fishes

Her voice is specatcaular, the words from vernacular are beautiful like her face
Despite her race i would like a place to interact with her, just to excite her grace
Her eyes in my mind i could never erase, her hair color, her smile with the perfect laugh
God made Goddesses for a reason, and hes really, really, wonderful at his craft
A wondrous creature, makes me want to feature her features and reach her
See her be a preacher with words of wisdom, can i keep her?
Can she hear my voice through the speaker? she looks like a queen from the top of her head to her sneaker
Leaves me speechless, i feel weak in her vicinity
Let me pause at a chance to tell you how cool i really think she is

How happy i am with this lady, the heartbeat i have underneath my chest is crazy
And it take me to places, where i never been before
Its not love just making sure, its not love just making sure!
What do all these girls take me for, what are they faking for?
Other females are trife and reckless, 6 months for a diamond necklace
Left me heartbroke, check the exit, its best i rest 'fore i wreck shit
But back to you, your attitude is pretty like the clouds in the sky
I don't know why i stare, maybe i'm in awe because your there
And its so fair that your so real
I forget that i lost a bet on this subject, at the end of the day its just how i feel
Your flowers for my day. just letting you know
I'm never letting you go

For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love

[Verse 1]
Pants still sagging to the floor
Sagging through your turf like I own this fucking earth
That's on my fucking life, I'm just living fucking life
This ain't House Party 5 but what's popping for tonight
I got a lil' more dough to spend
Let's rest in peace up on the LB like Nate did
Y'all ain't smoking y'all joking
Nugs big as Chuckie Cheese tokens and I'm toking
Bum house on Skid Row ain't this potent
Holy shit, I'm God-Scent, admire my stench
Cállate la boca in the presence of the most high (power)
Most high (power), Most high (power)
Yea you heard me right
True achiever, new Adidas still tryna earn my stripes

It's easy to assume we doing decent, true indeed
I'm not from here, I'm of Heaven descent
And you'd agree, as sure as one and two is three
You'd have this music down to a tee if you was me
It's 36 O's in a key
It's only one in Ab-Soul, still open doors
Don't forget the dash, I might leave you with a gash
I ain't doing no more shows unless I'm getting cash
Phillies full of hash, city on my back nigga
Fucked around and put Del Amo on the map nigga
Carson, Californication no travel agent
But every day's a vacation and mothafuckas hate it
I flew in, but I ain't complaning
And everyday I'm raining got the most precipitation
Soulo, Top Dawg Administration
Top Notch, Crock Pot Hot, wear your apron
Stop, watch, grab a stop watch, apply patience
And watch us pop across the population

Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run this shit
Go and tell em Soul told em, lick a scrotum suck a dick
Down for what I'm up against, clowning when you see me styling
Joking, smiling, scoped your poker face through these black shades
(Smoking on hay) in the middle of the barn
At least I think so I can't quite remember where we are
All I see is stars nigga, All I see is stars
I don't know if I'm on the red carpet or on Mars
Shout out to my bitches givin' it up on the first date, Between 21 & 38 (Great)

[Verse 4]
Motherfuck the government, democrats, republicans
Can shove it up, where they take a shit, we in this bitch
In a sense, I'm militant with a trigger finger itch
Cause I'm always killing it, you see this shit in my cerebral I invent
It should be illegal, I admit, surrender quick
I wanna see hands and white flags no matter if you teach
Eighth grade or you move weight like a gastric bypass
Get a good look at my ass before you kiss it, sons of bitches
Get well acquainted with it, we gon' be here for a minute
HiiiPower, pissing on the Declaration
Of Independence and you can bet my John Hancock the biggest
Fuck a proposition, 'less it's in my best, interest
Kissing ratchets in the mouth, lift her dress and show address
Don't be so upset, show some love when you see a thug
Getting pita bread, I put the nina to your head
You heard what I said

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, and more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

And they don't let me down

[Part 1: "Sing About Me"]

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em!"
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots]

[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Outro]
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

[Part 2: "I'm Dying of Thirst"]

[Skit]
(On the phone)
"Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?"
"Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"
"Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga."
"Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."
[Hangs up]
"Arghh... Fuck!
So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"
"Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now"
"Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"

[Verse 1]
Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 3]
How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

[Verse 4]
What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say "fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say "See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works."

[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
"Lord God, I come to You a sinner."
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
"And I humbly repent for my sins."
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
"I believe that Jesus is Lord."
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
"I believe you raised Him from the dead."
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
"I would ask that Jesus come into my life."
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
"And be my Lord and Savior."
(And be my Lord and Savior)
"I receive Jesus to take control of my life."
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
"And that I may live for Him from this day forward."
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
"Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood."
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
"In Jesus' name, amen."
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life – your REAL life



[Intro: On Screen]
When the lights shut off, an artist's dream is that their work will stand the test of time. The ones that influence our culture are the ones we most remember. Here, two powerful creative forces come together to elevate the status quo and lay ground to their legacy. This is their poetry. Sing about them. This is part one

Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac
In his prime, thug life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome

And I don't condone dickriding, I'm addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
"Compton!", a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit[X2]
Can't block or
Can't block or
Can't block or
Screen that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit

[Hook]
Now everybody sing that shit

[Outro]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]

Ughh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Ha ha haha HA

This feels like, right in front of the freeway
And when I'm done this should be in front of a DJ
I watch whack rappers put their soul on Ebay
Then expect excellence knowing their effortless
I don't have a preference, I dislike all
Say you run the globe? Well more like a disco ball
I spread love as well
Little nigga, big dreams, can bear-hug a whale into a lobster's tail
Ugh
Evacuate premises, rap's sinister suspicious
The pastor stand back, the bible is open, the words have been spoken
The moon and the stars align with the bars
The broads are snapping their bras in broad day
Cops meeting their quota running for arcades
The three initial's on the pistols printed all K's
The end is almost near, inferior of nothing
Superior is an option and my synopsis is that I'm Frank Sinatra
On the roster, top running
Running races with my own shadow
Look in the mirror then I start to battle
Now a pyru is a crip, nor a pyru's just a value that is sure to be heard
Like a fuckin sheep's cattle, niggas got some nerve
Talkin bout they move birds
Only thing I move now is a noun and a verb
I am now on the verge of telling the real story
Of a Compton native in the city "that kill for me"
Cus you fabricated the realness
The county building and the county children on food stamps
Glorifying street cred, talkin' about "whoop whamp"
But that's never the case
Just a good lawyer who can sever the case
Recording live from the city where the skinny niggas die and the semi bullets fly
Drinking Remy out bottle till the pain run dry
Like a desert
Once the Desert Eagle ride by, what you reppin?
What you reppin my nigga, you got a weapon?
Well I got a profession my nigga
It's called hip-hop since Pac was on gridlock
Me against the world every hour, every second my nigga
You want something, get something
I could start a career AND I can end one, I'm H1N1
UGH
Straight-A student who flow stupid
Real raps get permanent income, UGH
[Outro]
Beats and bars
Kendrick Lamar
Maestro whattup?

Ha ha haha

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
I don't need, I don't need nobody

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them
Super Solo Dolo attack, run and tell that
If you'd like to know, yes, I am on acid
Who could it be? K-I-D
Searching all day in the streets for DMT
Don't sip it, though - it couldn't answer
Drip, trip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie
Watch on who you hate on, fam', without the facts
Sad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat
To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that
You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth
Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about
But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber
Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker
Better get on back
You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack
And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be: Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo, C.U.D., repeat it

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I really want it - need it
Break bread - or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out "little Johnny is dead!" (oh you dead nigga)
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
If my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell it to meet me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

[Intro]
I woke this mornin' undecided
My demons takin' over my life, yeah
Sooner or later it's a family divided
These patterns gettin' hard to hide, yeah

[Chorus]
They say I should be satisfied
They tell me I got the world, but that's a lie
I wished the way I feel could be pacified, sometimes
I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Oh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

[Verse]
If I told you I'm 'bout to break would you look at me different?
Character out of place, would I lose your attention?
Let me know your intentions, cause lately I been watchin' everybody
It's apparent that transparency never seen monotony
Got off of tour, lookin' for closure
Mixin' emotion of bein' grateful and feelin' like some of y'all gettin' over
What's a puppet on stage, singin' and dancin' ablaze?
But trading his worth, distorted by the money that's made
A slave with a verse, I feel like Prince Rogers
I feel liberation is free, I feel I should miss the Oscars
Are you celebrating me as the artist or just a profit?
A question I have for the ones around me that's turnin' toxic
My lungs been heavy from all the smokescreen boobytraps
Reminiscin' on what it was, and knowin' that this ain't that
I vision a rock in a hard place
Hope my daughter isn't born with a piece of my heartbreak
You know stress carries on and your kids reap the mistakes that you made
And I admit that I can be dismissive if I can't relate
And I admit that I only commit to start playin' games
And I admit that I'm bad at talkin' myself out of shame
But who's to blame when the crowds stop cheerin' and they passin' dirty looks?
I now understand that I'll never be understood
[Bridge]
Isolation didn't work for me (Work for me)
Socializing didn't work for me
Prayed about it, didn't work for me (Work for me)
You can't cure this disease
The pain too traumatic for relief
Pull up the curtains, let the audience see

[Chorus]
I wish I was somebody (Somebody else, oh, somebody else, oh)
Anybody but myself  (Somebody else, oh)
Oh, I wish I was somebody  (Somebody else, oh)
Anybody but myself

[Intro: Swizz Beatz & Styles P]
Let's go, Swime
Oh, y’all thought you wasn't gonna get that Kendrick and that L.O.X. smoke, huh? (Yeah)
Y'all thought you wasn’t gonna get that LOX and Kendrick smoke?
That Styles P, that Jada, that Kendrick (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, y'all think it's games being played around here, huh?
Well, they not (Woo)
Lighters in the air

[Verse 1: Jadakiss, Styles P & Swizz Beatz]
The damage that we do is severe
The reinvention of the fresh, brand new every year
Them bullets hit him in his blood and flesh flew in the air
We put that work on commercial, we flew in the Lear
I lift the bar and the weights, then I'm doin' the stairs
They say the Lord only knows what I do to my peers
Tryna smoke, sell juice and pursue my career
So I keep a tight circle, I don't move with the squares
Rock a rugby like Puba, put two in the air
If you ain't qualified to kill, you should move to the rear
I'm from Yonkers, had to learn to conquer my fears
In the foreign, had to learn to conquer the gears
It’s the kick drum, yeah, it’s attached to the snare
I turn the Gat to the back, then I'm crackin’ veneers
You niggas stagnated, on the block, trappin' for wears
I'm in a mansion upstate, out back with the deers
(Talk to 'em, Kendrick)
Nigga, nigga

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Swizz Beatz]
Everybody, back up (Back up, back up, back up)
Man down (Man down, man down, man down)
Back the fuck up
Don’t play with me, I'll do you somethin' dirty
You talk to me crazy, I'll do you somethin' dirty
How I feel lately, I'll do you somethin' dirty (I'll do you somethin' dirty)
I'll wake up the neighbors, comin' through bright and early, woah
(That's where it's at)

[Verse 2: Styles P, Jadakiss & Swizz Beatz]
Cartel ties and dope bars
Life is a movie and death is the co-star
Mechanics to the game
Band of trail, foreigns the lane
If they heard that the driver is gettin' coke off
We be in the part of the party that get roped off
Mingle with the plug and the judge and knock 'em both off
Questions that we askin' ourselves, havin' a smoke-off
Spendin' money that's unaccounted for
If you scared to party with gangstas what you around us for?
We do what we want, my nigga, we get around the law
Yeah, it's bubble whips and square links
LOX get respect, nigga, 'cause fear stinks
A chair at the table, it's the commission, a rare thing
The beat come on, it's us, nigga, you hear the kings
We still smell money in here, Frank
Rap's like the dice game, nigga, we 'bout the clear bank (Let's go)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Swizz Beatz]
Everybody, back up (Back up, back up, back up)
Man down (Man down, man down, man down)
Back the fuck up
Don't play with me, I'll do you somethin' dirty
You talk to me crazy, I'll do you somethin' dirty
How I feel lately, I'll do you somethin' dirty (I'll do you somethin' dirty)
I'll wake up the neighbors, comin' through bright and early, woah

[Outro: Styles P & Swizz Beatz]
This is a LOX, Swizz product
If it's ice up in Heaven, we know Pic got us
It's love up there, we know Pic got us
LOX, my nigga, you don't know shit 'bout us
Double R, my nigga, you don't know shit 'bout us
D-Block, my nigga, you don't know shit 'bout us
Ask Swizz, he'll tell you we keep a clique 'bout us
Goddammit!

[Verse 1]
Fuck, watch how I kill 'em with the funky rhythm
I'll bomb if you don't feel 'em, piranhas in 'em
Feed my persona as I get deep as Nostradamus
No stallin' like the [inaudible], nuh-uh, [inaudible]
I'm ballin', cut up your pajamas if you're sleepin' on me
No promise, no peekin', homie
You're tryin' to confiscate the flow, I know
So I switch it quicker than my bitches
If they want your attention
One thing for sure, they gon' get it
I'm cursed with the world's negatives
Probably thinkin' I'm hurt, but that's the only way I can live
War, money, cash, drugs, got me feelin' like AIDS
Walkin' inside the club
Paid in full, it more be like [inaudible]
.38 snub huggin' my waist like it had arms
Then I bear it, so I guess it really does
No paperwork on this marriage
He love when life [inaudible] better than life

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Drunk off Paul, nigga, pourin' by the Rover, bitches
Pourin' hollows over haters, we killin' insecure niggas
Feelin' like the old Jigga, old Nas, old Big, new 'Pac
Oh my God, he's alive, he dropped bombs on you intellects
Bombin' everythin' from the streets to the Internet
Hear the instrumental wet
Then I'm a bust a nut, yep, I'm a fuckin' nut
That is not an Escalade, that's a damn armored truck
Shoot who? Shot what?
You ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
Who you motherfuckers want?
Leave a motherfucker slumped from the fuckin' pump
He's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in a trunk
Might be out in Houston, lean in my pimp cup
Ride in '84s, throwed like a shot put
Hoes on my jock like I'm from the ATL
In our new block, choppers on the rooftop
Flip a nigga like he was a NBA mascot
Strip a nigga from his Wade cap to his two socks
Got it from them Compton blocks
Raised from my grandpa's
Every day, caught a fade like we like we own the barber shop
Goons in the parkin' lot
Who are you to fool if you bark a lot with no bite like an iguana
Get killed right in front of your momma
Hold tight, coroner comin'
Summertime, perfect time for dove huntin'
And you a woman want to be at my house with her ass out
She climaxed and passed out
And promotional flyers, K-Dot be the flyest
Eat ten rappers a day, that's a hell of a diet
Straight up like a kangaroo
Pumpin' like a fist do from a pro-black
This is automatic rap, made a minute, take a second
I'm a get it maybe here for a minute when I'm finished
Let's begin it[Verse 1: Terrace Martin]
Doin' fifty on the shore, Range no tags
Punch pulled up, Kendrick in the back
A Da Bu$iness in that rag, Phantom on feet
And Problem in the diamond light pushin' that GT
Hood niggas with class, give respect where it's due
Came up with one boo and that was just to stay true
True to my music and everything that I do
Instead of practicing me you should focus on doin' you
So nigga fuck yo crew, what you wanna do?
Wack emcees never get no love I'm not enthused
And you can save all ya non-creative point of views
Cause me? I'mma produce and you just reducing ya crew
Now how I'm 'posed to work if I ain't gettin' paid?
Gotta call Terrace Martin if you can't call Dre
Now with that bein' said there is nothin' else to say
Was already understood, doesn't have to be explained
If it was never lost, how could it be saved?
I do this for my soul, I do this for LA
I do this for the love, man I do it for the game
And the memory of Miles Davis and John Coltrane
How could you blame them bastards, when they ain't have no raisin'?
They don't want no higher learning, they stick to the basics
And they don't wanna work for that white devil cause he racist
Neglected of knowledge, that's all they know, how could you blame 'em?
And I hate to say it but I had to as a man
We cooperated with 'em and fell victim to they plan
And after losin' Malcolm and Martin they scared to take a stand
If I call 'em pussy it's some bullshit, when will it end
So I don't really care 'bout who they say who is the best
All I know is that it shows within my music and my checks
I swear this is the best thing next to havin' sex
Geek smashed on niggas won't let my foot up off they necks, yep
[Verse 2: Problem]
Huh, strap it on me and let me solidify
And purposely intertwine, my positive thoughts apply in genocide
Compton communists are, shiftily, in peace
Whoever's in charge like Charles no sit-com
Beat him like a kick drum
Rip a hole from his lips to where the nigga shit from
Compton, Cali nigga!
It's all music, rule-less
Like a Ali fight, pushin' Al Green or Barry White
Boy this Cali life's amazin'
Palm trees, bomb weed and bitches
All my aprons and rubber gloves went cookin' in hell's kitchen
Bustin' shots that could crack back spleens
The lil rapper that could commercialize the backpack scene
Who sick? Boy, shit ... I'm vaccine on flight green
Paper planin' on the plane in first class, mad?
Because I'm on the bubble of success
Stressed over life, street still pokin' out my chest
Bitches love my confidence, I wear it like a vest
Sippin' Rosé Moët, drinkin' 'til I'm lost
Hustlin' everyday, bail away my thoughts
Anticipatin' the win but, ready for the loss
Got her livin' like a boss; Tony Danza, been bananas
Since the red rags of bustin' out a stanzas
Problem, answer, not one found!
Mayweather couldn't box me into one sound, he wouldn't last one round!
My songs' clever, my pen's better, than ever
A trendsetter with a vendetta...
Big bag of chips on my shoulder standin' tall like a soldier
Snakes in the grass I laugh dodgin' the cobras!
Scraped from the past, we amped wantin' the Kobra
"I'm far gone mommy," "Relax baby, it's over,"
Money pile coma, rovin' in the Range
Be it dope takin' its toll please have exact change, MOTHERFUCKER!!
[Interlude:]
Yeah, this is DJ Fuck Wack Emcees
Comin' to you straight off Crenshaw
That was Problem comin' straight outta Compton
Next up is A Da Bu$iness, South Central's finest
He cold yo...

[Verse 3: A Da Bu$iness]
Uh, salutations and greetings to all
Of my celestrial stars, gather 'round, get one out
We 'bout to witness the Big Dipper
Intergalactic astronomical avenue business man, finish him
Raining fatalities cause I'm like Vegeta said
Light 'em up make you feel like six million megawatts
My momma still wonder why I don't think straight
Run this shit like a relay, run that back like a replay
Come off the bench and will win and T balls like I'm Ebanks
Is ya swagga hand-me-down, where'd you get that shit off eBay?
Been bleedin' 'em since we was orderin' Jordans off of Eastbay
Bang (*gunshot*) that's what the heat say, in the game call me EA
Da billion dollar Bu$iness fuck the witness and the DA!
Let's raise aware-wolves, vampires, like the shit gets spookiest
Monsterous, zoo in the movie we call it the 'zoovie'...
Where they smart to come out he wearin' under that tool
From a cold winter degrees that's hotter than juvie
Ain't new to gangbangin' so all that gangsta shit don't move me
Fuck yo tats, know inside you's a bitch
And no matter how you dress we still sit through all of that shit
So fly I'm never taintin' you maggots still on my shit
I need a pooper scooper!
Little Mario don't care if you off a flower
No star I'll take ya princess for ransom I'm King Kooper nigga!
And this heat'll spit faster than a cheetah sprint
Dragonball, Super Saiyan on my Vegeta shit
A fact-avist and I ain't talkin' no civil rights and shit
Kickstand leanin' in Secret Sundays, with a ratchet bitch
I South Centralized the game with my hustlin' spirit
And Terrace Martin mastered me, so I know you hear it...
Da Bu$iness...
[Interlude:]
Put three fingers in the air
And say the word HiiIPower
Kendrick:

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Five star general in a G ride
Got my seat back, chiefin' like a Seminole, no centerfold
But picture that, picture me, picture Terrace, picture P
Takin' shit from some nigga that shit right there sound dumb nigga
We gotta post stay in the street, take what we deserve and yeah I
Serve on any artist that's my word that y'all are targets
I'm retarded on the mic, Special Ed.,
And bitch I call you special when you give up special head
I gotta feelin' it's gon' be a lot of killings Kendrick
Cause when I spit a verse I bring a hearse to every sentence
And put it in reverse and try to decode it
They on my dick and deep-throat it
They don't know it but boy I am a henchman, for hire
I require wack emcees, tell 'em that I'm burnt like 'Swap Meet' DVDs
Tell 'em that I earnt my respect on what you didn't do!
Ain't nothin' difficult your admiration's pitiful! Shame on you twice
Life's a gamble so I'm comin' out the gate with tricked dice
7-11, 7-11, backed on that
It's been a long time comin' since I bodied a track
I'm back up in this bitch like the ass and pussy was fat
I put my city on the map like I represent a post
Comp-town soldier, welcome to Iraq
Be ready for combat, or die on your sofa
Brains on the plastic, yo stains on the cabinet
YUCK! And if I fell off goddamn I would prob'ly land in a deep thought
A nigga need Spam for the shit y'all brought
I go 'H•a•m' in the Brougham bank corners like I'm Moss, fuck!
Headed to the coroner
I'm one of ya your run is up my gun is TEC I'm comin' for the
Common sense of commentators that say I don't love enough well
Y'all some haters tie 'em up and kill 'em later I am such a
Horror-vator I am so messed up to be replyin' and
Whatever favors mine are sick and hold up player I is fighting
Any favors I invite in meaning lasers beaming off the
Sun until I have a son and see you later motherfucker...[Chorus]
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Started at the surface so my goal is up
Cause once you stay down then you gon' get stuck
And I'm just trying to climb and grind, the same time
Dangling off rooftops is what I call our hangtime
Walking through the hall, counting my flaws
My ego got caught in a elevator wall
Got it out, raised it to the rooftop, damn
Got to take the ladder cause the escalators jammed
Made it to the top but I ain't even stopping
I said a prayer and a wish and turned my skateboard to a rocket
I'm gone, to the skies, I'm nothing more than another rebel
But I'm still trying to take it to another level
Get up out the ghetto, maybe hop up on the shuttle
Jello with a piece of metal, my foot on the pedal
People say the world could fit into a little pebble
Then give me one good reason why you think we should settle
(Let's get it off)
[Chorus]
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside my eyes, you can see the universe fly
Deep inside my pupils the aliens camouflaged
Another way to shoot you, my mind is of mass destruction
I'll drop a gallon of Henny in the Big Dipper then dive
Bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
Ever seen a Martian? Gorgeous or some U.F.O. Porsches
I live inside the air plus I wear Air Jordans
So the mic is always near me whether swaggin' or recordin'
Journey on my voyage, you know the sky is the limit
But it's ironic that method never applied to Kendrick
I catapult over your telescope and when I'm finished
I grab the fire that's burning from Mars to light an incense
This rapping's just a metaphor and I deserve a medal for
Writing another metaphor, about ambition
I envision me taking off astronautin' myself
Fuck the world, I'll beat that bitch with the Orion's belt
[Chorus]
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)

[Bridge: Buddy]
As I'm floating all alone
I looked up and I start thinking
In a moment I'll be gone
Getting high so I'm not sinking
As I'm floating all alone
I looked up and I start thinking
In a moment I'll be gone
Getting high so I'm not sinking
Getting high so I'm not sinking

[Chorus]
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)Part I: Stay Ready

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
We do not exist in
Any other instant
Here in this dimension
You and I are meant to be
I have waited lifetimes to find you
Now that you're here
I can remind you
Of the things you've been dreaming
Times two
I promise you
If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise you'll want plenty more
You've probably been waiting forever
So how does it sound:
Us on the ground
Giving you my love?

[Hook 1: Jhene Aiko]
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip
And when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
Ride on me like your Pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
I'm so hip to it, tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And, yeah, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (Mmm), we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seats thats inside this Porsche

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko and Kendrick Lamar]
Come to me, come, come to me
Look at what you've done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience only cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesn't lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million times
I wrote a million rhymes describing your star power
And after 24 bars, you get 24 hours
[Hook 1: Jhene Aiko]
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now
All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now

Part II: What a Life

All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
I been through some shit man
But I be on my shit man
I decided
That what you give
Is what you're given
So I been tryna do it right
I been doin' like
Whatever gets me through the night
What a life
I'm steady always on the go
You steady always on the go
We steady losing all control
[Hook 2: Jhene Aiko]
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life

[Verse 4: Jhene Aiko]
They say
The truth ain't pretty
But coming from that pretty mouth
The truth is fitting
'Cause you ain't never talkin' loud
And you know plenty
Yeah, you know what I'm talkin' bout
'Cause you just get me
Yeah, you so pretty
If everything is dipped in gold
Then, baby, it will never grow
Everything sweet ain't sugar coated

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life that I've been given
What a life
What a life that I've been living
What a life
What a life we die to live in
What a life[Skit: Little boy and Kendrick Lamar]
Ayo, K-Dot? You up on that new Snoop Dogg? That nigga shit bae! I ain't fuckin' with none of these new niggas, but that nigga, Snoop Dogg? That nigga back!

Yah, man (hahaha)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Didn't think I would last, I'm adrift on a draft
While I'm flippin' my craft, hold a gift to the gab
Cre-i-zippin' my rag see, hop on the grass
Peep-pop on these suckers tryna avoid the clash
But if I must I must, let me raise my glass
Tryna move on off and put you on up - some fresh game
Or how to maintain, sustain and gangbang
You never change, you stay the same
It sound easy, don't it? I put a lot on it
I be Dogg on it, I really want it
Achieve at the speed that you work at
And these is the G's we the throwbacks
Battlecat on the track
There is just no way you can call that a comeback
We done that, we run that, from the top back little to the front
We only here to give you what you want
Blaze the blunt!
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When your times is being rough and no one want to be near you (near you)
You know that I'll be there, I'll be right there
And when you're luck is so bad and no one really wants to hear you (hear you)
Just turn me on, and turn me out and let me play
Lada-di-di-di-da-da!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Horse and a carriage
Sports in a marriage, all in a day's work
Show you how these plays work
Longevity, heavenly blowing kush heavily
Rearrange my melody, no more felonies
Shout-out to my mama Beverly, and my grandmother the elderly should be upheld to the utmost
Dorothy Tate, half the reason why I'm great
Mississippi the state
Let me shake back, right back to the beat
And keep supplying y'all with more heat for the street
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Lion, it's all the same
One thing's for sure, this shit bae
Achieve at the speed that you work at
See these is the G's and we the throwbacks
Battlecat on the track
There is just no way you could call it a comeback
Did that, done that
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When your times is being rough and no one want to be near you (near you)
You know that I'll be there, I'll be right there
And when you're luck is so bad and no one really wants to hear you (hear you)
Just turn me on, and turn me out and let me play
Lada-di-di-di-da-da!

Sittin in the hooptie, looking for a groupie
Bitch I'm K-Dot, act like you knew me
Got me fucked up me don't pay for no booty
You looking for a prize, bitch I'm not no fool G
I'm hot like Cooly, sicker than the cooties
I got all the juice, you something like a Poomby
I'm soon to be the greatest for the ages of the young
Watch the game like a raven, craving rappers till I'm numb
Novacane can contain the pain that I brung
Bitch I shine like a microscope bouncing off the sun
Words bouncing off my tongue like a damn trampoline
Hoes manicure him enough the bottom of my jeans so I kick him off
Got haters pissed off, used to have no bank
Look at my account, you see O's like Rick Ross
I drift off to the moon, martian
Use the Big Dipper as a teaspoon
Parking my UFO somewhere that you don't know
Welcome to the C4
You see one you see four
Bombs in my peak hold
Bombs over Baghdad, son you niggas
You can never say I was a bad dad
Run you nigga like a marathon
This is when Vietnam meets the Babylon
Bring it to yo front porch, tanks on your grass lines
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, jumping from the foul line
In order to see the king you gotta swim through the ponds

More chains more whips hell yeah I'm living rich
We chewing MC's, like some licorice
Disrespect, get that ass smoked like a cigarette
And I'm the realest yes, keep these bitches wet
And we don't give em chips, we just give em dick
Got guns on me, cause them niggas hate
Better have insurance, cause I'm giving wakes

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Paint bubblicious, just a lil rusty
It's Friday, been on the donut since Monday, highway
How I touch sky like Kanye, kill em
Black Ali boombayah killa
SWAT meet shopping, till I not need nothing
Ran between the legs of a naughty women
Say it ain't so soul, say it ain't say
I ain't fucking with you like Nazi public
Fuck em, fuck it, slide in the bucket
You rolling on adults I'm sitting on the team summit
T-pain on, back steat fucking puffing la la la like a Lil Wayne song
And why would I lie like a nigga in denial?
When I can tell the truth and be free like style
Top notch TV don't touch that dial
Unless you finna wash up, you niggas better watch us

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Take a trip with the narcoleptic
Suffered insomnia, but this time it was only seconds
I see thermometers boil as you lay in the desert
Of eternal fire hate ya then deny yourself of a blessin'
Meanwhile I'm on a new cloud chunking the deuce
Renewed vows with sinners, homies, enemies too
Gold towel under my feet clicking the fluke
With a thousand troops, Crip and Piru, nigga, woop, woop
Love I depend on, white doves I depend on
They flying through this endzone that meant on to vent on
So listen, homie, you miss me with that bullshit
I keep my distance, homie, I am on a higher pulprit
You cannot visit, homie
I mean the beauty of heaven is far for me not to exit
It's ike an anti-depressant, you see the vision, homie?
I mean this godly advice, fucking right
Even if you pinch me twice, yes I, keep dreaming

[Bridget Kelly]
Lovely lullabies
I don't see another thing but starry skies
And louds of clouds beneath my wings and in the skies
As far as hazy as can see the sun will rise
And illuminate this life, this life
Oh why do I have to return to reality?
Oh why, this time I'll try
I'll try not to wake up from this dream

I’ll try not to wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I won’t wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I can’t wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I won’t wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
(Dream, dream)

I will not forget
Fixating the part of faith I've never met
And explaining away the reasons as I slept
So beautiful here I wish I never left
I never know which one's a lie, this life
Oh why do I have to return to reality?
Oh why, this time I'll try
I'll try not to wake up from this dream

I won't wake up from this dream
I can't wake up from this dream
I won't wake up from this dream

I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut

(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
To wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I won’t wake up from this dream



They doubted that I’ll ever make it this far
I’m shitting on them now cause I was piss poor
Swear you down to kill with that steel
But that steel don’t make you real
If you can’t even win a fist war
So fuck it, I shoot back at you cowards
Your death the pastor announces
Because we acting on violence
It’s either that or keep silent

Always testing nigga back and back on a challenge
So what’s your choice?
It’s kill or be killed, what?
This life for me was given
It’s pimping or prisons
Visits over missions of your digits
Getting questioned, for nothing
So where you from, you fucker
We busting over discussion
It’s justice to get concussions, huh
You asked for it, might as well get cashed for it
Price is on your head now it’s leaking from the dashboard
Cold world, so keep a heater
If you never trust in Jesus, let me make you a believer!
Meet him
Cause you would do the same
Take aim at niggas brains
And wouldn’t care of no one names
I shot ak’s, handguns and shotguns
Justify your pride, I would stand I would not run, I got mine

[Chorus]
Your heart is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice

This is dedicated, 25 summers I waited
Back when papa was sedated, uncles all incarcerated
25 cousins to play with
Also 2 grandmas I played with
One had died, one moved to Vegas
Both had died, I started raging
Back when LA get the laces
With the blue sprinkles and …
Only broke our concentration
We was broke but mama saved enough
To keep refrigeration stocked
With cut noodles and baken …
The black car was the first to watch
Black boy, first to drop
Then my homie, the first to shoot
Then his homie, the first to drop
So look homie, my best pursuit
Is music, this was finalized
When I seen the devil eyes in that Buick
I was hypnotized

War going on outside, nobody safe from
Kicking your door to ask you where you get your safe from
Kick you some more, you ask me where I get my hate from
Compton, baby, Afghanistan, this is phase one
Compton, … new talibans, central raise one
Rosecrans street tell them coppers get off me, day’s done
Got darker than Alfred mayweather
Never been so cold, 2 sweater and a long nose, they stressing

[Chorus]
When the world is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice

We all like Gingis khan, everyone think they can just become
The punishment of god, but problems never get solved
All the way from Compton’s corner out to Oakland shake it hard
I get a woody wearing hoody, before your eyes just…my marks
And bullets hiding lyrics from myself and Ken Lamar
In the middle of this war, we made it out to be star
Cop cars never came with good cops
I gotta keep it cop just for my neighborhood watch
Street justice

[Chorus]
Your heart is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
...fuck up the vibe
Go through my phone, you make me lie
We only look better when we don't got to try
Girl you look better when you don't got to try

[Chorus]
Real niggas still in style
Real women still in style
Fake hoes out of style[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Verse 1: Cutlass Reid]
Intelligent thug, half of the time I'm Nasir Jones
Cooking live at the barbecue
When I reveal poems from the composition
Destroy the competition
Never on the wire
But look Joe, here's the proposition
I pray for you fools every day like a faithful christian
Sunk my soul in white wood the whole eighth I'm twistin'
Cutlass, jet black '78 edition
I'm a genius, straight A's when I ride the rhythm
Cut the pie more than twice and I'm gon' get a slice
Don't act like I ain't the truth
Word to Proof, let's go get 'em Ninth
Uh-Uh, let's go get 'em Ninth
Middle East represent let's go get 'em Ninth

[Verse 2: Skewby]
I'm sad cause my generation got the blindest eyes
Niggas rapping 'bout drugs like it's saving lives
Investing time into these hoes like potential wives
If that's the mother of yo son boy don't be surprised
Didn't think that karma was real
The condom flushed down your toilet resurrected as a beautiful kid
Got you working double time to lead that cubicle shit
Make up your mind, holy design or Lucifer's tips
Yeah I know life's complicated
Open the bottle just to see it's all concentrated
Pulp fiction I will never pump fiction just to leave pots pissed in
Spittin' at the camera like Pac before prison huh
You know the losers say it happens to the best of us
The best of who dawg? Who are you dawg?
I'm U-turning in the clouds because of me
Been logging off since that guy on Youtube is me
Usually I would like attention
But strangers get stranger with every "Can I get a picture?"
I'm trynna tell folks blog posts don't make ya richer
But thank you for supporting all the genius in a nigga
[Verse 3: Naledge]
Tread water on flat land
My larynx hold crack cocaine for a rap fan
Looking for more than the shuckin' and jivin' of rappers compromisin' they taste
Like eating off a griddle no blow
Never congregate with the so-so
Snob hop in it's purest, this here is my modern life
I took a vow, never live moderate
That was way back when I was on Ivy league college shit
They won't let me live it down so I live it up
I used to want my city's crown now it isn't much
No shots fired when 'Pac died
Back when it wasn't cooler to be lying to the consumer
Matata Hakuna, I am the Lion King
Tell these hoes what they want, I'm the Lyin' King
Word to McLuda, Brainiac
No blanks in my six shooter, they all hollow
Take a tip, out the sip
Class is dismissed

[Verse 4: Add-2]
Yo, coming straight up from Chicago
They say I'm coming from the outside looking in
Looking like that nigga that your favorite rapper should've been
Better than the best right, catch me in the next life
Bet I'm still spittin' uglier than Usher's ex-wife
Add-2 a problem in the column Ann Landers writes
So mean but on the mic I'm near Planter's nice
A genius like Jean and Ninth and kill tracks
Trynna hurry up before Drake and J. Cole bring light-skinned back
You kick it like hacky sack, I ain't going back to that
For every scar on Seal’s face, I can spit a rap to match
They nervous like a suburban jumping the curb
And the shit I spit is stuck on they mind like hodgy wearing his turban
I was told to go harder, and try and touch the dollar
Mo' dots be on they ass than Laurence Fishburne' daughter
Artists hard as the hardest part the part a gotta martyr us
And Martin must
Guess I'll dumb it down we all smarten up
[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
If you look inside my mind you'll probably see atomic bombs
Loaded with explosive grenades holding dope rhymes
And it's potent
You never heard a heroic flow more divine
As a poet I know I'm the don
Like sunrise and I owe it to family genes
The Albert Einstein in the pocket of dungarees
And I'm dunking on Shaq with ease
It's a lay up every time I stay up
I'm in the studio the time they wake up, but wake up
It gets worse
There's not a weapon that can prosper
The prognosis of a sick rapper that can rock ya whole roster
This is genius, [?] can vouch in v-necks
Or catch a snow blizzard if Kendrick gon' visit
I'm that cold with it, you know me
My intellect get intertwined with God
Get washed up like a tide if you don't pay your tithes
Oceans divide whenever I speak
Cars will collide when I'm on this beat
Wreck shit for the record once the record peak

[Verse 6: Brittany Street]
Brittany Street, yea, time told on itself
Kinda happy here to see this, I’m a actual genius
Ninth, I’m on a pedestal lift a finger when it’s needed
A genius makes no mistakes
So it’s cool I had to wait push the bull to the side
And keep my power in the safe
Now I release it in this room
Even if you don’t believe you’ll catch a spirit in this place
I’m a actual revolver
When it comes back around hope it’s me for the take
I’m a thief for this space, I want it all or nothing
It’s never beef for this cake
And I’m the beauty and the beast and on this beat I will shake
Damn slow down Street, naw nigga this my pace
You need actual proof, I’m the actual stakes
Past the [?] around and tell them super genius on it’s way
Brittany Street
[Verse 7: The Kid Daytona]
What a beautiful day it is, cruisin’ to Mayfield
In a ride that glide like [?] when he was hoopin’ in [?]
Living proof for the ‘mazing is
Scooped up your broad now my palm on the cranium
Gettin’ dome, indoor stadium
Rocky ass roll when I’m all in your [Adrian?]
You must suck at life, I’m on the cusp of hypes
Unattainable to most, safe to say I’ve touched the sky
Delante West you muthafuckin’ [bride?]
Show some respect for the toughest on the mic
Daytona, paint images like Iliad from Homer
What you hearin’ is quotables
You never get it if you slow to move
Success smell sweet like when roses bloom
Defeat like sea salt in an open wound
I know some goons that keep the strap on like rented bowling shoes
[?] those them dudes I keep close for hoes like you
No lenience for idiots, my five thoughts beyond smart
He’s a muthafuckin’ genius

[Verse 8: Laws]
Yo they mocking me when they should be copying their Laws
Knowledge is forever but novelty wears off
Like names on a wall, and fade like hairlines
They gave mine airtime
This is for the Judas that call me Jesus in person then say he’s just OK
He jock my colour quality painted my genius gray
So I’mma meet the chicks he want and steadily strong arm ‘em
Make ‘em glow like silver and readily Long John ‘em
It’s not a problem, or one that I can’t solve
They wanna stop to talk shit man but I can’t stall
In this modern warfare they say that I can’t but I can’t recall
Poppin’ off with my back to the wall
Is being a genius being a capital G
In this day [?] avoiding it after seeing it
Either it’s something that you can’t reach
Or it’s something that your whack mentors can’t teach
Genius

[Verse 9: Sundown]
Knowledge connoisseur, genius provocateur
The genius schizophrenic, scribble my mental image
Replace the inkblots, graph a genius plot
Off the charts I mark my territory
Glory been [?]
Banner in the lab before the gamma radiation got to damage him
You bore me, what of Arabia? Pen prick
Dot my I’s, got my eyes fixed on Angelou’s prize
Bleed ink never cry, logic on the fly
I promised I would try to bring more
To make your lightbulbs fry
Shy of autism, walk with him he’s Rainman, huh
Talk with him just to figure out the game plan, ha, game theory
Marvel my brain picking pieces of a sane man
I make it rain again
Beautiful mind of intuitive design
By omega in the skies
And we don’t brainstorm, just cause you will waste it
We make it drizzle just a little go ahead and taste it
The brainiac has made it, a makeshift
Modern day genius, Act Proof that crazy shit
Dustin Hoffman, on again, off again
[?] and I’m lost again

[Verse 10: Enigma]
I am E, I do it seamless
Freakin’ this genius
Yup a G I is, but lethal we see y’all niggs
Straighten you out, you see my lens
Freakin’ this re-a-mix up a little [?]
I’ll find out whoever the comp is
I promise them [?]
They will see I’m kind of a monster
[?] my harmonica
Honest, I’m one of the smartest, like I’m from Boston
MIT-in’ it
Meet the illest team I’m with, more in tune like most improved to a [?]
Shit, clean cut, read a few books to get up my bucks
Give ‘em a mean look, believe it they seem shook, they stuck
Niggas get steam cooked when I read books
Roastin’ cats when provoked, and peep the Opus
One of the dopest, get to know us, [?]
And show it whenever class is in session
Know it, get out your notes
This genius shit? I wrote it, let’s goWhat would my name be? It gotta be something slick, man. It gotta be something, something real slick. "Hardbody." There's really no uniform. That's the catch. It’s whatever the environment he’s in, he chameleons into that environment. No mask, no nothing. You don't see him coming. The powers that he project is straight love. Energy. This right here controls how everybody move and how everybody thinking. You live in a world full of hate. You feel me? The homies right here hating on you, they finna rob you. They finna do this, boom, he gon' come in there. Chameleon. And you think he with you and your crew, but he working on the act of love. Y'all powered up and dap out and move out to the next spot. You going to a spot full of discrimination. He blending in there too. You know? He might got a suit on. You feel me? But he acting on the work of love. And what that does is, his energy builds up to the next man and builds up all the way around the world and everybody is just full of this superb energy. Everybody getting money. Happy. Living and enjoying their lives. And not hating on the next man. That's what he do. He might pull up in a Pinto, you feel? Or a two-door Honda or something like that. You know? Or if he in a prestige spot he might pull up in a Beamer, whatever the case is. His whole thing is about reality of it, you know, and not putting the cape on. You know? Cause he something different than a superhero. The archenemy villain, that's easy. I don't know if I wanna say a woman or a man, but I name her Lucy. Matter of fact, we gon' put it to a stone, we gon' disguise Lucy as a woman. In actuality it's Lucifer, it's a man though. She's seductive, she seduces everybody. She comes into a room and walk out. You think you feeling the love, but once you walk out it's nothing but negative tension around. You feel me? (I wanna see this movie, man) Yeah, "Hardbody." Yeah, we gon' do that. (That's crazy)[Intro: Kanye West]
Yuh, everything's so down right now

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made, memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when your down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I'm in pieces but it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, everything seems so depressing
I can't believe my grandma passed
There's nothing I can do about it
So I guess I'll just sit and cry, uh
[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
My mum is ill and passed away
I am so very sad, her death is out of my control
I can't get her out of my damn head
I think about her and it just makes me cry every day

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Yeah, damn, everybody's drunk and sad
Grandma passed away
We're gonna go to bed sad
And will have to be sad all the time, uh

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Life in the city, life in the city
Oakland, California, Compton, California
But we survive
Only the strongest survive
Life, life in the city
In the city and nigga's tryna survive
Only the strongest survive

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You ever been a victim of being a prisoner inside your own mind?
The bright lights of the street lights will make you go blind
Handicap your senses, you was just an apprentice of watching niggas jump fences
Now you in the Olympics and your hurdle was high enough to clear the tallest of clothes lines
Talented when they closing in on your behind
Life of a young delinquent, even stole him a Lincoln
At fifteen, middle fingers walked out the precinct
I mean the cycle just continue
The vital information and fine print on the menu
So you'll never read it even if  a nigga lend you
Money out my own pocket, to make it right
You'll still attend to
Be on them corners with stop signs and a nine
Cause nine times out of ten, MAC 11's cry
And twelve died yesterday and if anyone divides
The six that carried you eventually lose they lives
True story

[Hook: Kobe Honeycutt]
When the night falls anything can happen
We just pray we make it out alive
We all wanna make it to the top one day
Success is a street only going one way
But we all won't make it
Just try your best to survive

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B]
(You all wanna see a dead body?)
Well, follow me across the train tracks
Where angry and insane Blacks
They slang crack
Candles burn where they were slain at
And bottles get poured where they would hang at
Close, I give you truth in this essence
Dead homies added to swears when truth is in question
Like "Man I think he lying or he put that on someone"
If I known you ten years, got the right to say we cousins
I'm from the city of broken homes, and often I was home alone
And momma started smoking cause daddy was scared to smoke alone
Section 8 policies, Top Ramen and sunflower seeds
June got kill't cause he ain't wanna lose his Wallaby's
Constant atrocities, no one is safe
There's no religion that can save you, say goodbye to your faith
Whether you Muslim or a Christian, Baptist, Jewish or Adventist, Atheist or non-religious
Put survival on your wishlist
Cuz

[Hook: Kobe Honeycutt]
When the night falls anything can happen
We just pray we make it out alive
We all wanna make it to the top one day
Success is a street only going one way
But we all won't make it
Just try your best to survive

[Verse 3: KXNG CROOKED]
You walked in the apartment and saw your father on the carpet
With a belt wrapped around his arm and a scarf under his armpit
And a needle shoved in his bicep
Earlier this morning you warned him
His addict habits are something you couldn't digest
You cry saying "I just don't wanna see you die"
Now you tryna dissect the fact that he hasn't opened his eyes yet
You collapsed on his body and you started thinking
I could perform CPR, jump start his heart if it's beating
But his pulse started to weaken
His cardio region depleting as you given him part of your breathing
He dead and gone and you had a bad feeling when you was heading home
Now it's etched in stone, you've been left alone
So you grabbed his chrome gun, handle all pearl, aw nah girl
Put it to your head, thinking, fuck everybody like a call girl in a small world
Then pulled back but it didn't clap
Damn

[Hook: Kobe Honeycutt]
When the night falls anything can happen

[Verse: 1]
As my mind drift
Then split, like the middle of a spliff
I began to catapult off the cliff
Of the unknown, I got a feeling in my funny bone
That we're not the same, just antonyms of a different age
My soul flock, with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a Goldie
(Haha) L-M-F-A-O. I hate yall, but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter
Is a brain fatter
See my vision
Or my vision'll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so
Yall copping fitted caps
I'm about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it
I play kickball with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius
I interact with the inner city villains
That are into your circle
Like a computer hack
Then give you that (Haha)187

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Now I done grew around some niggas that caused me some drama
Swear when you make it niggas say you owe them
Swear they think they your momma
Everybody with their hands out
They always ask me, they know that I got it
My biggest fear is going broke
Can't say no, that's my problem
I wanted that Rolls-Royce
Young boy looking to make a bad choice
Then it got fucked up when mom went to jail
I heard a little voice
Back of my head, Back of my mind
Dropped out of school but a nigga did fine
I ain't telling you to drop out, but if you do make use of your time
[Hook]
I said why they hating on me I'm just trying to get my guap
I'm just trying to set my family up

I'm looking at fixtures that I don't remember
I'm all in my zone, Karl Malone
Taking these shots, abusing my liver
It's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I'm gon' spend it
(Aughhh!)
Doomsday, Doom's date
These niggas weak like it's a tuesday
Niggas get loony like a toon stay
Everything well done, like two steaks
Who they? ain't from L.A
They fall off like November days
They worry bout your sales
But, at the end the day, who getting paid?

[Intro]

When should I start, my mind is apart
From playing videogames, , then back to the start
I am not even kidding when I say I stop washing my face
In the mornings, texting  you back

It is crazy, how we get obssesed
With things that arent useful, then we feel stressed
We become a mess, we might need a distress
Signal, to tell others we need help


[Verse 1]

Help, yes we need it yet we dont accept it because we are inside this shell
Wake up, go to work, we on some kind of wicked system
Some kind of wicked list of things we do that
We dont accept its

Kind of what you see when people are on the streets
They talk to themselves
You ask to yourself, is that myself?
Talking to some higher being that relies on a shelf

I dont know. But i know that I do
I ask God every night, free me from this delights
He watches me, wanders his gaze and he looks at my face
And he says, silence

I dont listen to him, I think Im going  crazy
If he doesnt talk to me, who is gonna save me
But then my conscience is chasing me
I go silently to my bed while some voice is telling me:

[HOOK]

Why are you saying you need to free yourself
Why are you asking for help, do you not believe in yourself
You can make it through if you have enough will, man
But you have to swim out of this pool before you drown in it, man


[VERSO 2]

Me despierto, siento, dolor y sufrimiento
Recuerdos de la noche, misma mañana en un desierto
La bebida, la salida, la vida, la esquina, la cima
La unica salida que veo para mi vida

Matutina es la nocturna
Y encima, cargo con pesadillas, mis noches son frivolas
Ir a "trabajar", encender la television
Dormir y pretender que mis sueños son mi familia

No tengo quien me arrope
La noche es oscura, mi mente se calla
Y el sonido de la calle, me llama
Suenan disparos, suenan las motos, gritos sollozando

Esto es mi mundo, encerrado en mi tumba
Moriré seguro, y mi voz no retumba
El silencio, la dueña de mi tortura
Lo poco que queda, para que sea la medianoche se turna


En lo poco que queda para que se vaya la luna
Odio la noche,la luna, y que la vida sea igual de inmadura
No entiendo, como mi ego  me afecto en el camino que una

Vez transitaba, la vida pasada
La viste pasar no, no la dejaste pasar, verdad?
Eso me decían pero que le haría
Si igual algun día me rechazaría

[CORO]

Son metaforas con doble sentido que espero que algun dia no se cumplan
Pero seguro en la mente de alguno seran memorias que mas que pasadas son continuas
Esto es una piscina llena de mentiras que intentan alejarte de la verdad
Mientras mas te undes en ella, mas dificil se te hará flotar

Niggas love to pop bottles
Then get you a table my nigga

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
No syrup in this cup but this that po' up
When you see me po' up, turn up til you throw up
Like a bulemic fiending, for hurl over them toilets
If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?
One bottle, two bottles I'm a soldier, never sober
Cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis
One life, that's all we have, Ok lets toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor
Swim laps like Michael Phelps

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it

Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose
With it we all trippin off the hen like a female chicken
You with it? (Soulo)
Spread your wings, you probably won't get far
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us

Under my pants be a golden dick
Bitch, everything about me solid
Burberry nigga, them be my draws
Alexander McQueen in closets
Swagged out king, yeah nigga I'm Puff, uh
Have that pussy throbbing
Someone tell me where the drugs at, I'm into that
Twisting off them molly caps
Ciroc too don't fuck wit Goose
Can I get a shot, swim in your juice
Worth a stack a minute, everyday that shit repeat
I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet
Bitch did you see your tab receipt?

Aw man... where is she taking me...
Where is she taking me...

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep, and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
More, more, bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more

Aw man… where is she takin' me?

[Verse 3]
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Outro]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother![Refrain]

[Verse 1: Lecrae & (Natalie Lauren)]
Uhh! I know it's gon' kill me but I just can't let it go
And the, taste so appealing's got a grip upon my soul
These, honey dip lies mesmerize me
Pride's got its crooked fingers twisted all inside in me
Fools walk the path I'm on, never to be seen again
Sippin on seduction while we eatin' on some secret sin
(No one will never know) says the whisper in my ear
And I know I should be over this but I ain't seein' clear

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
Baby this is innocent (killa)
It won't even hurt a little bit (killa)
I'm only here for your benefit (killa)
I'm your every wish (killa)
Come on and let me in (killa)
Baby this is innocent (killa)
And it won't even hurt a little bit (killa)
Close your eyes and let's get lost tonight (killa)
It'll be alright (killa)
You'll see I'm not a (killa)
[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Her feet go down to DEATH, so don't let her consume you
Even though her heart is black, her exterior's beautiful
She'll take yo' life away, and strip away yo' joy
Pretends that she gon' build you up but she just gon' destroy you
Evil looks so lovely covered in her lace of lies
And the silky smooth seduction just manipulates my mind
Her fabrical fabrication is fuelin' my fascination
While I'm intoxicated she starts her assassination
I'm losin all my honor and my years to the merciless
Givin all my life away but I'm just so immersed in this (killa)
Take my breath away
I hope I wake up before they start my wake up
Somebody make me break up, I'm datin a (killa)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
My friends fell low, when they was so high
Got me runnin' scared of myself, no lie
And I know I'm gon' die, I tried cold turkey
But when I'm feelin' worthy, Satan's sure tryin' to merk me
I'm doin' myself dirty, flirtin' with what's perverted
I should follow the word but I guess I'd rather be murdered
{*ahem*} Excuse me I mean martyred, cause I'm killin' myself
My sin conceived a baby, and we gon' name her Death
Breath {*gasps*} taken, she take my breath away
Replaces it with poison, and I'm so swept away
I need some prayer today, hope I wake up before they start my wake up
Somebody make me break up, I'm datin' a (killa)

Down... When You Could Be.. taking me... down!

[Verse 1: Kent]
Hell nah, hell nah
You got me fucked up like Jim Bean
And your second toe is bigger than your big toe
Chillin in the studio high, puma clydes resting on knees
She keep bbm'ing me get home but I'mma fucking G
Girl please
You ain't even my girlfriend quit
That type of shit gets you kicked out the in crowd quick
Two fingers together just like yo legs I make em split
She said I'm broke. And Hopeless
Yo best friend lemme hit DEST
Last laugh, watch me stack cash
Since you won't let me work file transfer some pictures of that ass
More Kush and wine
Waking up next to two dimes
I smoke one and poke one
They both hell as fine

[Verse 2: Joon]
Well I scooped her up like a spoon
Told her I'm June
Good if ya nasty
But I be on my grind so ya can't see me all the time, but when I come baby, I come DEEP,like the trail of tears baby
You understand me?
They told me you stingy if you smoking on anything that's less than a dime
And you miccy if you pokin anything that's less than 9
You live in LA!! and I know In you I found something special
We connect so many levels
But endeavors for the cheddar got me bed-less and you the wettest
I really wish I could be there I wouldn't be jus trynna pull yo leggings
Cause you know my every fetish
And what I love to eat breakfast
And it damn well eggs it ain't Even on the nobody's checklist
BUT MINE
I'll be there in the blink of an eye girl quite whining
Lemme get these dollars
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sleezy]
Everyday we back and fourth with the same discussion
Say I act like you ain't nothin
Girl you buggin thought we had it clear I ain't tryna be yo husband
Them feelings got you wishin it was Somethin that it wasn't
Why you spazz when you here I'm in the club from yo cousin?
But she ain't tell you she was on me too she be frontin
Man I really shoulda done it, let her blow me like a trumpet
But you be bitchin cuz these bitches in yo ear bumpin gums like
"why he always in the studio?!"
Got me feeling guilty I ain't even in the mood to flow
Damn you so predictable sending text wit ya flesh exposed now I'm ret to go
When I see that ass girl bets believe its goin down

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
My woman be trippin sometimes
I remember her strippin off martin and sipping on some of the cheapest of wine
Which way we gone climb? I'm tryna get higher but you desire land mines, Blow Up
Every time I'm, In Clubs tryna network my social
Life like I'm supposed to but I'm wrong
To you I'm very wrong, but you don't get it, and you won't admit it you say I'm like your ex but I think were nothing different
She gave me them digits
But I didn't call, I put that on me
And yo girlfriends, I know they throw salt like Angelina Jolie, now let's see
I'll be gone til Wednesday, gotta show in Portland
Now my baby, say I ain't her baby
But more of an abortion I'm like that's crazy
I bought that Lexo, and sat it on Jordans
Now miss lady, if promoters don't pay me
Then we can't afford it
Forging signatures on fake check
It ain't life if I don't break sweat
To break these mics on every set
It's ironic I'm Tryna stay grounded at the same time still fly these jets
Hello, goodbye marro rodeo
It's funny you had a great, but still you took ungrateful
Chorus[Intro: Jay Rock]
Now these niggas don't want me to win
I guess I just gotta talk my shit then
Aye

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
[?] like Top Ramen is spread from the bounty
This hunter is aiming straight at your head, niggas doubt me
Tell em' they better count me in, like Dracula
Packing a black mack in the back of a magnum
You rappers is gon' go
That's one hell of a punch line but let's get back to the flow
Left jab hit your nose
Right hook fracture your skull
Your body is free
Put luxury tax on your soul (OG)
That's what they yelling when I'm pulling up
Like a rough rider working out in the hood and stuff
They say I ain't in the hood enough?
Bitch I'm a transmission
The pump leak when your oil slipping
And I been in the kitchen, like a toaster
With them toasters, hang you like a Willie Lynch poster
East side vulture, preying on your dead caracas
Sorry I was starving
[Hook: Jay Rock]
Niggas out here don't want me to win
So I talk my shit again and again
(Again and again)
Imma talk my shit

So I talk my shit again and again
(Again and again)
Imma talk my shit

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Imma talk my shit cause I made
Every stripe that it takes
To be able to write what I say
The beat made you hype for the day
The beat made me write with a sway
Me and Jay bring the night to the day
And bring the night to the page
As far as bars go
Literally up there fam I call the stars home
I'm by far past far from the forlorn
I leave this bar open unless you log on
Figure that part out
Wikipedia that
I Wikipedia whack and look up your stats
More fuckers start hiding when they get on the track
They ducking behind the snare like I ain't divvying that
And if you speaking of the speaker
I'm the speaker that the speakers applaud for
Speaker that the speakers turn on for
I'm leaking through the speakers on all y'all
My short term speaking is long haul
Your speaking is all gone
[Hook: Jay Rock]
Niggas out here don't want me to win
So I talk my shit again and again

Straight from the Pyrex pot
I'm a crack rock wait
Grab the A1 sauce let's raise the stakes
Catastrophic K.Dot
Currently stacking currency
Bet I make profits like I'm God
Every instrumental get dealt with
Burnt and melted
Jump in the water
Jaws is ready to eat you selfish
I'm cold hearted
That's for sure
Talk shit like a nigga farted
But the smell came out the other hole
(Yuck)
Hol' up, big truck
Lurking the premises
Pull up, hoes rubbing they clitoris
What the fuck?
This is K.Dot, they pray I
Fall like a jump shot
From they favorite player
With seconds on the clock
(Yep)
Im here to souffle ya'
Turn rappers into
Anything barbecued
They're miniature party food
I get spizzy
Like I'm Hugh Hef "Come fuck with me"
One first tonight
Might change your life, right?
[Outro: Jay Rock]
Yeah
Imma talk my shit
'09 is mine nigga
Ain't no stopping me homeboy

Get with it or get lost
Roll with it or get rolled the motherfuck over nigga

Get with it or get lost motherfuckers
Ain't no stopping us nigga

I can think of a million reasons, have it all as your seasons
Say no more I feel ya b, say no more I feel ya homie
We traveled the Neverlands, fireworks in the south of France
Take it down and come again, again
But look
You don't get too dirty in my whip. whip, whip, whip
Keep it nice and flirty in my whip, whip, whip whip
Pop your pretty ass up in my whip, we gonna make it last up in my whip

[Intro]
Don't judge me

[Verse 1]
I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key
Looking like a star, with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
She got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think
Everytime we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
She be like:

[Hook 1]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...

[Verse 2]
Until one day he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right
When he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone
Matter of fact Tyrone was on speed dial
So when she got home, it was going down, she go:

[Hook 2]
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...
[Verse 3]
I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist
In her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like:

[Hook 1]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...

[Verse 4]
Until one day he wasn't acting right in the middle of the night
She checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum
And the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
Then ran outside, then started driving on the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she gon':

[Hook 2]
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...
[Verse 5]
And so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up
Put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that
It was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now
Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they:

[Hook 3]
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas...

[Verse 1:Ab-Soul]
Yeah... if you don't know my name by now
Just call me any rapper, could get it
Any month, any week, any day, any minute
I'm knocking ballers off of their pivot in this scrimmage
They painting pictures with no description
Like a witness, who took an oath of no snitching
Mind ya business, like the best entrepreneur, I be diminished
By the metaphor, in the following sentence
I told you I does it a dozen times, you must of thought I was lyin'
Yeah I'm nice but I'm not too kind
So dope I can say the same line two times
So dope I can say the same line two times
I don't care about your age, your creed, or color
The squares in your circle or the angles you covered
If you in front of your girl, your cousin or mother
I spread your ass out in the street like butter
You got your toast, well I'm on a quip with a quote
So a bullet leaving your chamber's like a word that I spoke
Soul brother number dos, I'm a breathe in hundred's smoke
Driven down central by a nigga in some Loc's
Never going back to Cali cause the nigga never leave
Even when I'm out the state, you see me, you see L.A
And ain't nobody fucking with me, like a virgin with Klamydia
Recognize, Top Dawg Familia
[Verse 2: Bad Lucc]
Yeah... it's so amazing guru
Jazzmatazz, the sound thinking of yoo-hoo
Scrap, I'm going all in, it's the top dog
With them Top Dawgs, nigga I'm not your
Average rhyme, put together, the architects
Build raps, sell 'em his starter kits, the beast boy
Fat boy get confused with monster
Bury niggas like Contra, I'm your savior
Don't call that man upstairs, cause if them stares
Compare to me, look you shook like Mobb and them
Been say, dark as Sinkay
Be hell to fate, I've been great, ya dig?
How could he, rap was such a force
When I've been doing this since car hard jackers that figured four rock
More problem, gangster, goblin
Still in this tower with no robin, get that?
Stacks in my jeans, yeah they know the deal snoopy
Lovin' big bitches but they don't fit in my two seat
Turnt the heater and bang, like my niggas from the hunters
Shout out Bubble, what up Getta
Sticking to my plans, rap for my fans
Hootchie, lent that groupie that dick, get a Trans
With no album, no show, got 'em golo
Been about the turf since Merf was on the ocho
Thugging like amone, word to the chrome
Lights excite bike, I'm rushing to the throne
Spitta, fat nigga jerking like he skinny
New era Henny and a new pair of pennies
I'm off my rocker, niggas do me nada
Proud but still in my pradas, ya bitch
Bad Lucc see me now, yeah that's what's up
We the West, it's what's up, ya dig?
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Aiming out the cannon of bazookas
100 ways to fuck you, over, no Karma Sutra
West coast till my death bed, cutting up
Somebody fucking with Mr. Edward Scissorhands
I've been the man before you've been the man
And I've been the man's equilibrium until it's worrisome
Aiming for his gut like Caesarians
Throw me in aquariums, I bet I'll grab a shark
Snatch out his heart, freeze it then preserve it in a jar
I'm all these niggas bumping like stickers at the end of a car
Aka K Dot commit a sin, press record
I kill 'em every time, this ain't a free verse
This a crime, you rehearse, or duck the bomb
Big ass W, and I throw it up like powder in the hands of Lebron, nigga what?
Compton on my raider cap, oh wait, no wait
But we want our spot back, then go nuts
Somebody hand me their jockstrap, I ball everywhere
Pure beast, a bear couldn't even bear
Royal flush, like the feds rolling up
And I fuck with Bad Lucc but never broke a mirror
Yeah, it's like that for you other coasts
I'm right back in the '87 regal, and the people watch
My wheels peel, like it's Motrin
I'm a headache for pete's sake, you cheapskates
Can never out do me, or better yet do us
Water's run deep, and you fucking around with scuba
Divers with riders sticking their hand inside the cooler
I live in a iceberg, you telling me you cooler?
I'm living my dreams and I can kill Freddy Kruger
Bout to run the game in some ran down Pumas
And my name Mr. K Almighty, try to low ball
But she speaks only highly, try me, Q
[Verse 4: Schoolboy Q]
Let's see how many do it
Put your hands up now, let's see how many truant
Lying to the people, know you want for your doings
Good with this rap talk, I'm kinda speaking fluent
Influenced by cocaine, gats, and my dickies
Life in the '50's, swisher sweet wrapped in a sticky
Malt liquor stuffed up in paper bags, got me sparked up
First nigga act up, he getting choked up
Locced up, only seeing .45 from the jeans
You see a nigga work from the spleen, you naw mean?
I be the truth, if I'm not, you be holding your tooth
Blessed or not I might bring hell in the booth
Hallelujah Lord Jesus, wish Pac was here to see this
All these niggas sucking penis, straight fag, take a dick
Up in they ass for cash, why most in their chains for jags
You heard about them L.A. niggas
Catch ya ass, strip you out of your Pelham nigga
While I'm doing it, screaming out "L.A. nigga!"
Stay with your mouth, something like the L.A. sinner
T.D. enter-, you don't even get this sinner
Dumb muthafuckas, cause a ruckus, y'all suckas
Boss nigga, Schoolboy got a problem to solve
Top Dawg, y'all under the paw
The new shit like swine flu, covered in sores
Told ya..

[Verse 5: Jay Rock]
Holding up a W, nigga you ain't loving us?
We ain't loving you, fuck what you're going through
Rock got a point to prove, this ain't your average 16
This a death blow, you running outta petro-
Don't have enough gas, to last with this metro
Don't have enough cash to blast with this Rambo
.45 tucked in my boxers, yeah we slang iron
Fuck around and box ya, Y city shots-a
Welcome to the land of the choppers
Nickerson gardens you better watch us
Ready for the drive-by, on the roof snipe out ya driver
Run around straight to the car, leave no survivors
That's how we get down, you don't wanna sit down
Better take cover when you see us in your tizzown
West Coast takeover, give the game a makeover
The end is near, you fake rappers, your day's over
Red fitted when I step in the place
White t, black jeans, boo yah on my waist
Yeah.. it's the rock, HOVA, get it right dawg
Fuck a rap battle, fuck around and get your life lost
Lay the clip off, bust until the hammer break
Knock your head off, when I aim it at your face
That's that gutter rap, show you where the gutter at
When it's beef time we gon' bring it where your mother at

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
West coast tsunami come jump inside of a wave pool
Fresh out the county with beepers over their ankles
Bitches and bugs their earlobes flooded with bengals
38 slug passenger seat let it bang you
I was born the same year you was rocking a kangol
20 years later my style favor a kangaroo
Jumping off the ground im tapping the star spangle
Banner with manners over ignorant lost angels
Cameras flash nappy hippy from every angle
Hammers will blast snap and hit you from every angle
Like a porno no homo you wear rainbow
I'm with a bad chick that can suck on my mandingo
Your making publicity stunts to make your name blow
Im dropping c4 every month to make my name blow
Drive a hoopty every month like its a range rove
Get in on the passenger side because the door broke
Take you on a natural high this is for sure dope
Watch you go be outside then give you more dope
Im gonna flood the streets outside go buy a raincoat
Open the door my tapes fall out your Durango
West coast till im gone and wearing a halo
Til then im ready for war lets play halo
Take down the fifth of Hennessy and watch the day go
Bye like farewell can somebody just pray for
Me like holiest priest on gods payroll
Tabernacle to all the Church's chickens I ate on
Its K.Dot you motherfucker motherfucker mother blucka blucka bring a ruckus better duck em make you suffer quick suck a dick

[Verse 2: SchoolBoy Q]
Look, coming from gangbangers and palm trees
Eating on polly seed and bomb weed
In Wallabees, better yet, my Wallacees throwin' up the set while I'm chillin in the summer breeze
You niggas really want the gun to squeeze
And im shootin from nutting
Backseat with the window down ready for ducking
I ain't riding shotgun unless I gotta shotgun fuck around and pop one leave your fuckin' top done
Like the body shop on a mardi gras
Bad little bitch keep the gat in the party bra
You know I'm ready to shoot you know I recruit give me the loot like Big Poppa who shot ya noodle niggas over cheese make pasta
Top dawg sit at the table we all mobster
Never passed english and grammar still proper

[Jay Rock]
My niggas we all gotcha

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
My niggas is all shottas
And niggas ain't nothing but bitches they all gossip
My words come hard like a bishop in tranquilizer
And murder goes hand and hand like sanitizers
I been a problem shootout to Problem

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
My gun blow then I get low
Like a stripper my nigga no homo
Take a puff of the swisher then get dozed
I do this for my niggas who is locked up in the prisons that can't get out of them systems there's no hope
So my mentality gotta be cut throat
Everytime that I spit it I provoke
Jay Rock for president go vote
Put them in a state of shock like a million votes
I'd go big before I would go broke
I got bundles of snow so come snope
Big bottles of henny who wanna toast
Big bags of green who wanna smoke
Its on me im a do it for the coast
Rock city my city till I'm gone
I'm a make it I can feel it in my bones

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, I came in with the same precision as Pablo
Your visions is at hoes, whips and diablos
City on my shoulder like a poncho
And I treat the booth like el baño
Get a whiff of that
And when its show time i'll take you to the Cinemax
Los Angeles on the fitted cap
Committed like Richard Pryor and getting stacks
Yo Punch they think that history is a joke read up on how they brought Woodstock to watch for black folks
California souls, you say the west ain't unified like the LA school district you must've missed it
Riding around my old junior high high, remaniscing I have the same goals now
But I never thought for a second I needed Snoop and Dre to help me out
No debit give me all of the credit
SOUL

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Once again it's on
Hey girl, yeah shake that thong
Afterwards put your name in my Nextel phone
You ain't gotta leave your man alone
Just come to my yard if you want this bone
Take a hit, I'ma have you switching homes
Searching for me you'll be ditching homes
Cadillac truck, yeah sitting on chrome
All debts paid I ain't sitting on loans
Hey ma, I'm loving the way you move
Plus you working it in them high heeled shoes
Yeah I'm kinda tipsy of that gin and juice
Lace the weed a little bit, give my high a little boost
Head to the spot so we can get loose
I wanna pop cherry, I ain't talking 'bout food
You looking so good in that sexy suit
Oh, I'ma tell your momma on you

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, I'ma tell your momma on you
The way make it move like a stripper do
Oh, I'ma tell your daddy on you
How easy it is to get next to you
Meanwhile, I'ma let you get wild in here
Meanwhile, I'ma let you get it hot in here
Meanwhile, I'ma let you do your thing in here
Meanwhile, I can keep a little secret, can you?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
It's K-D-izzle
T-U-nizzle
How I get down, make moves upon the ground
Stand on the block with the K not the pistol
Fuck with Jay Rock everyday it's official
Seen shorty run away, not invisible
Fuck your mental a nigga love your physical
It's that simple I'll show you what a pimp can do
Put you on corners and have niggas renting you
Like real estate, see a bitch, fuck her face
K.Dot never hate, only dig, penetrate
What you know about that thing cupping your waist
Legs in the air duct tape
Your man [?] aim straight
Know where the pope went?
I'ma send him to that same place
If you was smart you would touch base, like home run
Then grab pipe when the plumber come

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock, K.Dot, yeah we keep the place jumping
Girls on floor straight grinding, humping
Subs in the back yeah the speakers straight bumping
Start set trippin' then my boys start dumping
Watts so [?], chain so icy
Fuck casual, looking smooth in my whitey
Back in the days, yeah them girls they like me
I rolled with Doom Dog, now they all on my cock B

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
All wanna watch me
All wanna jock me
Take 'em and send 'em straight to bed
When they stop me
Have 'em with sheets over their head, like a Nazi
[?], head given properly
Wax on, wax off, Mr Miyagi
Let me know momma, I show you where your thighs be
Stick in all the time just like an IV
Your so called thick shit, that don't surprise me

[Hook]

[Intro: JaVonte,  J. Cole]
Before we walk, we must crawl
We run when temptation calls
Before we walk, we must crawl
We run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, often I'm caught up in confusion, in need of dissolution
They tell me the solution to see through this illusion I'm living
A few friends killed, a few sent to prison
Our mamas tried to warn us, but few tend to listen
See, we running the streets, in search of some trouble, at least
A couple of freaks to sneak home with
Now she ride a nigga dick, just like she owned it
So every time I wanna hit, I bet you she on deck
She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty
Slim waist, Gina face, Pam body
Met her in the club, little liquor led to love
That's the reason why my niggas can't find me, good golly
Look, shawty, ain't no need for games
I know a nigga still young, but I don' seen some things
If it's cool to talk, let me ease your pain
This is food for thought, let me feed your brain
Your ex-man did you dirty, did he leave a stain?
When them losers talk, tell 'em "please refrain."
I refuse to stop, don't freeze the frame
Cause tonight, I got you calling out Jesus name, hey
[Hook: J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, JaVonte]
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Often I'm caught up in confusion in tryna find solutions
To try and pimp the system that's a form of prostitution, I'm ready
The city probably see me as a nuisance, deadly
Singing the Devil's song in a repetitive medley, I know
But shorty fire and she admire that I'm a pyro
Maniac, I said "Where you at, and do you have Geico?
I need insurance that you could sex me the best."
And she started sexting through texts
And sent pictures under her dress
Got them G-Strings, she beasting for the pleasure and pain
I was a weakling, so I cling to her under my name
Gave her the ding-ding, then "ding ding," the bell ringing again
It was intriguing that she seen, don't no stand
No flow, keeping it wet, making it rain
Beg your pardon, don't blowjob, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin
The blowjobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge
That blowjob had genius like Mozart
Got blowjob, then put it in her trunk like Goyard
I'm starting off with that Cuevo
Shop on Rodeo, house in the Dagos
We like to fuck and watch the day go by
Hasta luego, drop the potato
She's hot, what can I say, yo?
[Hook: J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, JaVonte]
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls

[Outro: J. Cole]
I'm losing temptation[Verse 1:]
I’m the only nigga doing it, you other niggas ruin it
I’m too legit go hammer with the foolishness
My nana said my grandma can maneuver this
Industry until I’m stupid rich
And now I’m stupid rich (so rich)
Even if she go away…. (wawoowoo) even if she go away
Assuming this is what they humorous
The pimp, the butterfly, my newest sh*t
In fact the rumor is way I’m proving it

[Chorus:]
I’m a Texas Man.. (Texas Man)
I’m a pimp C and your boy bundy
I’m Texas Man..Texas Man (hey girl)
Where they sip Conee and the purple codine
I’m a Texas Man, born and raised represent til the grave
I’m a Texas Man, whoa baby I’m a Texas Man

[Verse 2:]
Everybody in the scene show me love (what’s up)
From PA to H town got to know we blow it up
Got the whole damn city on my back (PA)
Tell em I’m gonna get the cash then bring you right back
I’ll be gone til November
Then I hop up on a plane gotta do a show in Spain
With some ladies and liquor (bring the wine)
Know we about to have a good time.. good time
And they don’t have all that.. no they don’t have to have all that [x2]
[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I been that cold, but baby
Fine is all I know 50 carat
Watching all that for
Pay you know attention, what you doing all that for
Make your hoe a listen, I right a coalition
Pretty face, fat booty, cameltoe alition
When you were catching a buck
I was rhyming and busy
You went and got you a Chevy
Now me I bought me a Bentley
You finally found you applaud then I succeed on my pimpin
You been looking coat check to scope look like zero to pimp
I do this sh*t for the sport like it’s a hobby of sorts
I make that birdie spread eagle
And that’s your par for the course
And I’m a classic man made bask and dance
Soup black and tan with the racks in hand
So you got some bad b*tch, where they at though
I’m stuck on hating and know what they doing that for

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Yo you rocking with your boy Wash of course
Shout out to everybody in my city man
We on baby
Old arthur what’s up
Let’s go[Hook]
There, there, baby
It's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up
There, there, baby
It'S just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up

[Verse 1: XV]
Three women raised me
Famous Footwear paid me not enough to blow up
But showed up cause I ain't fuckin' lazy
And teachers thought I was dumb or crazy or both
With hopes of being a Nas or Jay-Z
I slumped, in my chair and my grades, my head wasn't raised
Being fly was priority to the lowest
I would stand on my desk just to see the world
In a different way, the dead society of a poet
Homie I'm focused, but there's somethin that a dude can't prove
I mean fam, I was damn near invisible at school
So I banged for a minute cause all my niggas was crippin'
Just me and my two of my dudes, Blue Man Grouop
Had dreams of doing things they say that you can't do
Cause everything ain't black and white, 'less you chew bamboo
So I was after big bills like a toucan do
All the while my mom askin' why I'm truant at school
She said
[Hook]
There, there, baby
It's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up
There, there, baby
It's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up

[Verse 2: XV]
Uh, so why ain't I go to college
My mommas ultimatum made me say that I know I got it
My niggas said V's buggin'
Stay on your computer software, debugging
But we holding hardware cause we thuggin'
Now they in the trap-house with some guns that they done borrowed
And all this snow, I call it Infant Sorrow
With plans to reach the end even if I had to start slow
Sold CDs in the mall, making dough like Sbarro
Then I left the hood, like fuck it don't need the cargo
They banking I don't do well, and I don't mean Fargo
But even when you leave, somehow it still try to follow
Baby brother took a charge harder than LeBron and Rondo
Trying to keep his head up while his eyes are in the Bible
Cause they say a mind that's idle is a devil's toy aisle
My nephew looking at me cause his daddy is his idol
I looked at him, told him sit down, this information is vital, look
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Living my life like I'm living right
In the midst of a fire pit, the gang-banging and violence
Is the sweetest song and I roam with the heart of a violin
Don't violate my patience I'm waiting, to kill a man
As I stare at the ceiling fan, as a fan of these wicked streets
If I gotta eat, I steal like a metal piece
I'm screamin' out fuck the police
I'm dealing my cards with Jokers on em
You can disown him or stone him
I'm throwing them rocks back, with the fury of bullets
You couldn't live your life for the moment
When I'm foamin' at the mouth
And my sharpest of teeth showin'
I'm in the back of a black Buick finna black out
Like February, ain't that's how Blacks do it, right?
I cut off my ears before I hear your advice and vice versa
I'm screaming for help, as loud as I can but that's not working
I'm working them corners like blueprints
Then caught an L on my first offense
The judge threw the book at me and said this

[Hook]

[Intro]
Reporting live, from Compton, California
North Cackalack

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, no Audemar on my wrist
Its arthritis from holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
Whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
With offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, who ya? No one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
Like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
Off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
To celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear

[Hook]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even Zeus can get beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
City like a District Attorney beatin' the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers

[Verse 4: Rapper Big Pooh]
U-P-S, I deliver
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped

[Hook]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to the story of my life, Miseducation of Kendrick
Stressin', Hennessy shots, throw 'em back like it's vintage
Wondering "can I live?" Where is the generosity?
Something just gotta give, tryna stay positive
My mode is to be a mogul
Searching for a dollar without compromising my vocals
Really I'm just a noble
Kid from the west side of Compton
My cousins was selling crack, while I played Sonic
You say that you grinding, you niggas is full of shit
And might need a Heimlich
Maneuver to throw up what you consume
My shine is bright enough to make a dead flower bloom
In a room full of curtains
I'm for certain that I'm certainly popping a pistol verbally
And never will I get shot, ya aim is all fucked up
As if a Sidekick dropped
I'm nice wit it, bro-bro
My peeps depending on me, we be where the stove go
Let's eat

[Verse 2: Wrekonize of iMayday!]
British (?) lay 'em down, thanks for the fuckin' bank
William Wallace Malatov blonde shank to sprank
You cold in the D well I'm like Frank and Dank
But when the whiskey's all free ima break the tank
I speak an amazing maze
To make a mason maybe need a matron
Hey, my sonics bless ya drums like a patron saint
In Section 80 they all talking like you reppin crazy
Blood Type O positively, yeah my record's rabies
[Verse 3: Bernz of !MAYDAY!]
"Been there, done that," ain't got the scars to match
Beware, these boys shoot flares and pull masks
Got gas, spread the mustard on the custard
Vanilla muthafuckers up and droppin' by the numbers
She jackin' up my lumber, I ain't even say I love her
Piss blood on these bitches tryna keep me ground under
Hunger games with lames, now I drive in my own lane
Ever since supporters started tatting the frames, MAYDAY

[Verse 4: Chief of Blood Type]
YEAH...yo
So many try to Dr. Jekyll and hide
And try to cover the side
That I could show you in pride
They try smoking the line, then try sniffin' the joint
If rap is about the money these niggas missin' the point
I can't, stand bias from people who never stand by us
I got a feeling for killing innocent stand-byers
I give a fuck if we could float ya boat
It's Blood Type, nigga cut ya throat
I'm done, BAH....Chiefer

[Verse 5]
I said be grateful and give some thanks
And he said "man, for what?"
I been outta my luck cuz I been stuck
And plus I'm broke as fuck
So shut up and pack it up or take it elsewhere
Get a nigga off this welfare, with some healthcare
Can you help there?
He thought he deserved and had the nerve to kick the blame to me
But strange to see how it came to be
This game just ain't the same to me
And I ain't gon' sympathize or look in his eyes
And tell no lies
So I said "FUCK WHAT YOU HEARD
THE TRUTH BURNS, BETTER RECOGNIZE"
[Bridge]
We have yet to see....
Where these roads will lead
So we take what we want
And give thanks when we receive
We have yet to see
Tomorrow may not be
So we take what we want
And give thanks when we receive[Chorus: Scoe]
(Thank you doctor)
Reminiscing on when we used to smoke chronic
Now we puffing the kush and I'm like
(Thank you doctor)
For giving the West Coast CPR
Now here we are, we like to
(Thank you doctor)
We can never pay you back
All the shit you did for hip hop and gangsta rap
For that (thank you doctor)
Without further adieu
Diggy Doc, this one is for you

[Verse 1: Scoe]
I remember growing up
Just a Dogg Pound pup bumping G Thang
It's that gin and juice in my cup
And all I knew was N.W.A
Eazy, Yella and Ren, Ice Cube and Dre
Big Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg and raised
Kurupt, Daz and RBX, the original gang
Bad ass super fly, I can go on for days
D.P.G.C., that's the way I was raised
And motherfucking 2Pac was my shit
Especially when he was rocking on the Doc shit
Killa Cali where it all started
Legacy, me, I'm just happy to be a part of it
This west shit
It's history in the making, this is the next step
California's best kept, yep
It's your own Scoe, I'm a Y.A gangsta rider
On behalf of the South Central L.A, we wanna
[Chorus: Scoe]
(Thank you doctor)
Reminiscing on when we used to smoke chronic
Now we puffing the kush and I'm like
(Thank you doctor)
For giving the West Coast CPR
Now here we are, we like to
(Thank you doctor)
We can never pay you back
All the shit you did for hip hop and gangsta rap
For that (thank you doctor)
Without further adieu
Diggy Doc, this one is for you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember when it all started
On Alondra in that small apartment
Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges
Pop a flick and blunt ashes all on the garments
Momma of off wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four, but it was like I heard it before
A house party cracking of the music the Doctor recorded
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mocking that shit like a parrot
My cousins kicking up dust cripping
The flag, they wear it around their hand like a mitton
Aiming use it for leverage
Shitting on Compton sheriffs like fuck the police
Woofers and gold rollie's
Every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped
Dropped the dub just to hear Doc drop
A jewel for the sake of hip hop
Who ever have thought the moment I see you bullets for Cali love
Fifteen years later you be saving my life, what

I was only four, but it's like I heard it before
A house party cracking off of the music the Dr. recorded
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent

Me no conversate with the fake—that part
All my bitches independent bitches—that part
I just want the paper—that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part, ayy

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
It's impossible to love it, if you don't come from it
It's things that goes on, you just can't stomach
I seen it all happen, but I ain't sayin' nada
Peep, 24/7 in the hood it's hot
If you wanna fall through, get Top on the phone
He don't pick up then it ain't bool
Let you know it ain't good to stop
That part, that part (That part)
I'm a Watts nigga and we not kosher
Shit, niggas only concern is the bottom line like a stockholder
This is where they come, where they cop them boulders
Hoes catfight with their tits exposed
Still sippin' on that Wild Irish Rose
Still rock swap-meet designer clothes, ah!
Black MAC 11 in my mattress (Woo!)
Make a hundred racks do a backflip (Woo!)
Might go Uncle Luke on them hoes (Ho!)
Pussy pop for a bankroll (Yeah)
All my killers with me got a blank face (Yeah)
On that "Fuck you, bitch, where the pay pay?"
Make 'em pull up on your block with them 223s
Aim it at your face, hey
Movin' with the rock and the Glock concealers
You either sellin' rock or you flock to get it
You either on the watch or the clock is tickin'
The life of my Watts and my Bompton niggas
Get pinched, I'ma post a bond
Know P.O.P. gon' hold it down, look
Need cash, gotta get you some
If a hater tell you money ain't everything
He don't want you to get none
So we thuggin' like DMX, bleed shit, PMS
Point blank, period, meet me on the ES
I'm fully with the BS, believe that!
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And we don't stress
A .38 'til it free your chest
Then PP on the PO's desk
I'm JAY-Z in a blowout press
Relate me to your blowout's best
Can't hate me, I'm remote you're deaf
I'm HD, causin' photo theft
My AC antifreeze gotta—that part
Hold your breath, I'm 8 feet when I hold this TEC
Protect me from the local threats
My ID say my eye don't rest
My IV qualify T-Rex
Society kept my IQ vexed
Denyin' me from an Ivy school
Applyin' me to the street I slept
I quietly had to hold this tool
Reminding me of the block I repped
The turf I stepped, the church and the earth I blessed
The first I guessed the alert was the murk I chef
That hearse the flirt with perks of a kill confessed
Dispersed the worst, the first 48 addressed
The search of laws and verse of the birth I nest
The—uh, the awe, the curse of a pose in zest
The good, the flaws, the pain to reverse what's left, uh
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Me no conversate with the fake—(Hahaha)—that part
All my bitches independent bitches—that part
I just want the paper—that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part, ayy

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Zest god, zest god, zest god, zest god
Yamborghini high, cream soda with the Wockhardt
Soulo Ho3 the prophet, yeah, Soulo hold the profit
That's the fortune teller makin' withdrawals and deposits
Ironic, they wanna know where I've been in
Where the fuck I've been hidin' in
When the fuck am I droppin' that
New work that take 'em to church and
Turn the universe upside down again
Since you're so smart
I can't get in my groove 'til we get the Q first
Do what thou will not
Yo, my pool of thought large enough to part the Red Sea
Father forgive 'em for they know not know who they see
I got all eyes on me, call me 3Pac
Soulo

[Interlude: ScHoolboy Q]
Hang on, nigga, let me get some
Hang on, nigga
Hang on
[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
Made a mil' and I spent it in the same day (Day)
Got a chopper, not the AK (Ayy)
Gettin' money on a vacay (Hey)
Go go gadget's in the driveway (Driveway)
Groovy Tony in July 8th
Yeah, I'm killin' kitties on a Sunday (Ayy)
How you ballin' in a Hyundai?
My Ferrari got a toupee
Swerve in the big body
Your favorite artist, I'm his big homie
Yeah I'm walkin' with a fifth
And I ain't votin', I'm a Crip, homie (Yeah)
I'm where them Bloods, where them Locs at (Locs at)
Where the blood, where the choke round
Gloves for the combat (Combat)
How the feds in your contacts?
How the feds know my set name?
Fled in the Mulsanne (Ayy)
Hydrate up the rap game
Heard Soulo comin' up next
And SZA got a classic, nigga
Heard Zay just got it mastered, uh
The fire burnin' through the plastic
So fingers to the badges (badges)
They don't love you 'til the racks evolve
When I was broke they wouldn't accept the call
Now they on me for my decimals
Blank Face has gotta X 'em off
Enemies gotta bob and weave
Gangbangin' like we stand for somethin'
When Alton Sterling gettin' killed for nothin'
Two cowards in the car, they're just there to film
Sayin' #BlackLivesMatter, should've died with him
Wrong nigga in your hood, you gon' ride on him
White nigga with a badge, you gon' let that slide?
Tell me how they sent that footage off and slept that night
I feel bad that my daughter gotta live this life
I'll die for my daughter, gotta fight this fight
Put a Blank Face on, nigga, let that drop
That—that part[Verse 1: Jasmine V]
Yeah, that’s me right there
That’s me right there
Nobody gotta tell me how to do it
I took it from this life, I can hold it down
I can’t even lie, I’m the truest
Put that on everything, on everything
What can I say? Anytime, anyplace I be on it
Not many know what it takes
How to handle this lady, I own it

[Pre-Hook: Jasmine V]
Baby believe me this won’t ever stop
I can make this look easy, got this on lock

[Hook: Jasmine V]
Yeah, that’s me right there
Yeah, that’s my man
Yeah, that’s me right there
Can’t  nobody love that man
Like I love that man
That’s me right there
That’s me right there
I ain’t never goin’ nowhere
We ain’t ever goin' no where
That right there
That’s me right there
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, what you want with it
I, recognize that you’re on with it
I put your name in a song with it
Emoji through the phone with it
I ménage, nothing wrong with it
And now we’re late, when we gon’ get it
We up early in the morn’ with it
Early in the morn’ with it
I Brace yourself, baby rate yourself
But I know its only ten
Better you save yourself
Ain't no crying when that headboard start to bend
No lie, 4-5 for the game, we shoot uzis
Cinematic, might claim this on a movie
PG-13 don’t please me, P.S. no BS, I’m usually
Teasing myself or somethin’ like nananana
Once I get it I’m a selfish one like nananana
Jasmine only ride Aladdins like nananana
Then I’mma cuff that like one time
Only one time I’mma tell you, I’m

That right there
That’s me right there

[Part I]

[Intro]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

[Chorus]
Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

[Part II]

[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies

[Hook 1]
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like "doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”

[Verse 2]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

[Hook 2]
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')

[Verse 3]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still "nigga, what is you sayin'?"
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

[Break]
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

[Verse 4]
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: "Hello? What you doin'?" — "Kickin' it."
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

[Outro]
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!

[Intro]
Yea that's right you better walk away
Go on and walk away cause I'mma burn this motherfucker down
King Kong ain't got shit on me

[Verse]
Running them ghetto streets, I ain't cooking up nothing
But I got the tea kettle on side of me, that metal on side of me
I dare you to follow me, I'm double daring you to follow me where the drama be
His momma in debt, so she can't pay the funeral fee
So wherever them candles at, that's where the funeral be
Kids don't get sleep, guns keep 'em up real late
Walk in the school, shells laying on the concrete
Take 'em to school, show and tell, for that final grade
She gave him a 'F', I say that young boy deserve a 'A'
Cause she never slept where he slept, or seen ricochet bullets rip
Through his cousin's face, ripping his face off
I aim the fifth straight, concentrate like I'm playing golf
I'm Tiger Woods with a gun in my car, I keep one in my car
And keep a bitch with implants, so she keep one in her bra, boom
Shit, make room for the lil bastard
The flyest nigga you seen on centennial campus
The eight ball tucked in my jeans while I'm getting patted down
They didn't know I had it on me, stupid security
No one securing you, if I'm gon' touch you
If I don't like you, the Mossberg pump love you
I take that back, it probably just wanna go and fuck you
Go with you, then dump you inside the coneal confortable
Defending my belt, depending on nobody but myself
Unless you talking 'bout money, I need yo help
I need some help, they say that my screws is loose
Like handlebars on mongoose, this is true
You tough rappers, I'm talking to you
He ain't on no used to shit, but you see his face grew
He say that he fabulous, but really don't have a clue
That he just a puppy living in this zoo
Shit, whoo, with that said, you should know I am the truth
The truth hurts, you should feel pain when I'm done with this verse
I'm done.... psyche, I ain't finished
Ever since the first grade, been bad with the run-on sentence
I never sat the benches in the game of life
I played the whole forty-eight minutes, Christ
I rap with precision and lyrics, is grandma nice
I'm cooking up something, you want you a slice? Then get it
I'm holding my stomach, I'm shitting, I'm farting
On any rapper thinking I'm in his vision, is you retarded?
The CL got my head spinning awkward
Bought it last month, 'bout to put it up for auction
I'm not rapping, I'm talking powerful
And for that dirty money, boy, the Mac'll shower you
The Mac disintegrate, and then devour you
The mag'll forget you, regurgitate and sour you
I world trade you niggas, north and south tower you
Steroid, my authority overpower you, the industry ain't affording me
They might as well just give me my money and start ignoring me
Cause y'all niggas boring me, y'all ain't making no dollars plus no cents
I swear, y'all niggas foreign to me, foreigners
I tell you what, go and tell it to the coroner
Killing 'em whenever my performance come
When I do it, it won't be nothing right after I'm done
When I ruin niggas' careers, put you niggas in tears
Get you pom poms, you better off, cheer for me
Shit, the new money is here for me



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Lalah Hathaway]
Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm caught in my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Chorus: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Chorus: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

[Verse 1: The Game]
Tell them mothafuckas I'm forever paid
California king, wrestle gators in that Everglade
Drive up out that mothafuckin' swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin' résumé
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole – I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smokin' that chronic just to meditate
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweight, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me, shit, I was sellin' weight
Now a nigga's sellin' millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performin' in front of millions, nigga, every race
6-4 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
Fourth album, no five mics? Then let 'em hate!
But I'm not stoppin' till I'm the fuckin' king in every state

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm sick of mothafuckas talkin' about "the West died"
Can't you hear my heart beatin'? That's the motherfuckin' Westside
You test me, you test God, I'm His son
It say in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums, and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter of fact, shorten your list, nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov… probably Pac, Nas
No particular order, bet a mill' that I slaughter
And serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly
When I'm the nigga sold 5 mill' out the gate and numbers do not lie

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me

[Verse 3: The Game]
I gave you The Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waitin' for
I'm the lost angel knockin' on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for?
I love you ‘cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor
Walk up on you, like, "What's goin' on, baby boy?"
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy or the black Slim Shady or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more?
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well
We don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickridin'
I'm addicted to Westsidin'
Livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin'… and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city where a nigga hadn't seen that shit
"Compton!" – a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never TV-screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit!

[Outro]
Red is a very emotionally and intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stop lights, and fire equipments are usually painted red. It also represents one third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you! Enjoy it!



From the very heart of me
Belief becomes action
And no distractions will take my eyes off the prize
Greatness is my goal
But there's failure on the way
Full of insecurity, self-hate and doubt
But what I can't control can't confine me
And what I can't do can't stop me
This is how I express myself
Not how I follow others expectations
But how I stay true

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, I got stamina
Oh-oh, I got stamina
Oh-oh, I got stamina
Oh-oh, I got stamina

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't give up (no no), I won't give up (no no)
Don't give up, no no no (nah)
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no

[Chorus]
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
[Outro]
Oh-oh, I got stamina
Oh-oh, I got stamina
Oh-oh, I got stamina
Oh-oh, I got stamina

[Chorus]
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shift's
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin’
Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I’m satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but—

[Chorus]
Don’t tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you

[Verse 2]
My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk-ass
And crush ya whole lil' shit
I'll Big Pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil' bitch
Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame
And when I get at you, homie
Don't you just tell me you was just playin'
Oh, I was just playin', K-Dot
C'mon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro
Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know
I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll
Yellin', "One, two, three, four, five
I am the greatest rapper alive"
So damn great, motherfucker, I've died
What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (facts)
A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach, nigga (facts)
I'm fresh out the water, I'm 'bout to breach, nigga
The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears
Mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
You know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump
Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
But when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
G Malone, big bro, kudos to him
I was two O's from a M, tryna be big as Em
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all suits
Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
'Nother classic, right back
My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
With TOC, you see the flames
In my E-Y-E's—it's not a game
And the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the CO's watch him
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
Look at the crowd, they— (Naw, I don't like that)
Look at my smile, I'm smirkin'
Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck!)
So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck!)
So many verses, I never run out (What?)
You makin' him nervous, the music is loud
Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo punk-ass down!
(Sit yo punk-ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)
My name is identified as "That King"
I'll let y'all worry about a list, I'm on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together

[Outro]
Let's get it!
Look, look!
On foenem

[Intro]
Uh
A lil' Compton nigga
Just a lil' Compton nigga
One time for my niggas
You know Compton, nigga
Just a lil' Compton nigga
Kendrick Lamar

[Verse]
Back with a vengeance
Back with my heart and I'm venting
Back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me
I never wore a kufi, ignore my religion
I believe there's one God, there's one love
And I believe if I fly, we all doves
I make a way for my people to see the light
Brighter than yellow bones
Me and my microphone could be one
Until I see BIG, Pac, see Pun but this ain't Eazy
I can't take a Big L, my city needs me, I gotta win
The proof is in the pudding
And I been fucking with Cosby since I was ten, you damn right
By any means necessary get campaign right
Very emotional I'm a Gemini, I love hard and I fight harder, a born author
A born starter, in the game for real
And the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
You can't learn if mistakes ain't made
You gotta pay homage in order to get paid
You gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
And you ain't gettin' it, 'til you start payin' Jews
Lifestyles of the young and the broke
With my hand under oath, I recite these quotes
And if I ever lie then I die where I stand as a pest not a man what I wrote through a rap
In order to see the front, I had to play the back
We played our position, we let ya'll play ya'll selves, ya'll made ya'll decision
We pray while we prey on competition
To flip another page of Corinthians
I see stars when I write these sentences
Words crash cars when I write these sentences
Open jail bars for my niggas life sentences
Free J-Dove, kill all witnesses
Ya'll better hope 2012 really real, cause the way I feel I'mma make ya'll suffer
And take ya'll supper
I haven't ate in the last 22 summers and I'm 22 now it's about to go down
So en garde, my God we got these artists in awe
Oh, I'm free
Finally I can say I'm me
The Kendrick Lamar EP, classic EP
The question concerns
I dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
Hope ya'll infected
Hope ya'll ain't have no protection
Still I'm progressing, room for improvement
Make room for the groom married to his music
I was at the XXL just trying to excel
Networking, meanwhile my stomach turning
Wanted to be apart of it cater it to my audience
J. Cole runnin' late
If he don't show up, think I can take his place
Ladies start laughing
No pun intended I ain't being sarcastic
Homie popped up with about twenty bags and
Fresh out the plane I couldn't even complain
My nigga was on his hustle I introduced him my name
Said I'll see him on the bubble in the future, my dude I salute ya
Contributing the real shit
Talk about it make the people talk about it
Make the world see, for every MC that I see tryna stay afloat
Tell 'em build a boat like Noah
And take him to a place that I'm sure we all can blow up, boom
I ain't a star yet but I'm gettin' close to em
And if you see a whack artist do more than boo him
Throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera
Then kill his manager
Then hang a banner up, that reads you can't proceed without bein' conceived by one album of the 90's
On Rosecrans where you'll find me
And all my niggas is grimy
But I remain the good kid
Tryna make a difference where I'm from, where you live
Oh no we got to slow the city down
I told the homeboy pump his brakes
He said that he rather put the pump to his face
Sawed off
Torture, turn the saw off, its scorchin'
Hot where I'm from, the newscasters don't come
Another ratchet got dumped, in the trashcan I ain't done
A baby in there with it
She said postpartum did it
Molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
When he was undressing said it'll only be a minute
That's why I always think I'm kicking something with feeling
I should've been a dentist
I should've been a blizzard-cold
Flash, pose, flash, pose, a critic paparazzi got me on my toes
I wanna jump on him like a tad-pole, tad-pole, ass-holes
Tryna kill my dreams
Not elevate
Those are not my dreams, I'll be straight
With a little bit of passion
And a drive like an Aston
Motivation from Nipsey or Glasses, Jay Rock
Mykestro , Bad Lucc, U-N-I
Dom Kennedy, Murs and Fashawn
Lady G, Willy B in time
Ima blow like I'm mothafuckin' sniffing lines
Go like I never seen a red light shine
Flow to my heart, hit the flo' when im dying
Heart of a lion, tell em get in line
And pass the baton, I won't pass it back I ain't good at dimes
If the bitch bad I could pass you a dime
Haters better duck like I'm passing a pond
Know I'm the king and I'm passing you pawns
Pad on the hill (as in a big house on the hill) that's a passion of mine
Problem is I shine like two mics under heavy strobe lights
I'mma need two mics just to get my point across
I'mma get my joint across, country ya'll gon' want me
P—
[Outro: Sample]
"This is a song that makes me spill out all my guts—"

[Intro: Dash Snow, Daniel Joseph & Kendrick Lamar]
"I’ll tell you what I don’t believe in, can I do that? All right, I don’t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. That's what I believe in not believing in."
"So what keeps you alive?"
"Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don’t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that keeps me going. I’m a pretty dark person, I’ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing."
Thank you

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have
And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me "Rap about life, not rap niggas"
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listened to "Faith," and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
Because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice
I ain't lying
I swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
It's kind of scary, ain't it?
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless
'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it
So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him
Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break, I still won’t break my promise
I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like, "The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?"
Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'
Never will I surrender
I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said 15
Called it an EP, they said I’m trippin'
But little did they know, I’m tryna' change the rules
That we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions
Uppity bitches handling business
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home
In LA everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most of y'all cats just don’t know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain’t doing this for my health, I’m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes
Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
Look, the mastermind took the master's mind
Just the perfect time, just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision
Look, the mastermind took - (cough)

[Outro: Alori Joh]
We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP. For this is the Kendrick Lamar OD. Because of you we are Overly Dedicated

[Produced by The Roots]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
One two, one two, one two
One two, one two, one two
One two
Turn the headphones up Ali
One two
You mix with Dre, right?
Turn the headphones up

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So I'm talking to God, "Can you wash all these demons off me?"
This last year I've been quite similar to Aaliyah
Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
A G5, g's give high-fives to me and say, "Kendrick, just persevere
The presence of being real"
As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles
Thinking, "How can I make an example for this generation of Compton?"
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
Or turning back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act right
Trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
It's dark and plus hell is hot, that's the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame
That's the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
Make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse
Now Punch is my mentor, Top Dawg is the coach
Jay Rock is my older brother, I was there when he wrote
His name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
Would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
Found ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out
Soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought
Q ain't got a place to stay and 'bout to sleep on the couch
We eatin' off each other tray, the dollar menu amount
Meanwhile the coast going hard at each other
The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs' comfort
But I ain't need it
I never screamed out "the New West," I didn't believe it
They brought each other down, I was planning out my achievements
I need to separate myself to stand out
I need a better way to take your fans now
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow tips aimed at your head
I'll be damned if the chopper jam now
And we never asked for no hand out
In the midst of it all I recall a call when you said how
We could never resolve in the hall of fame
And I went to the trial with a Bible and a rifle
I play the game as I blam blow
Hollaback at me, nigga
And if they said that I'm the one, why you asking me, nigga?
'Cause when the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David
And pray to God that ya make it or live your life in the matrix
'Cause falling off is a sickness, I heard that it's quite contagious
I need to separate myself to stand out
I need a better way to take your fans now
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow tips aimed at your head
[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I'll be damned if the chopper jam now
And we never asked for no hand out
I'll take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now
In the midst of it all was cooking with pots and pans out
Looking forward as four of us are forced to form a new clan now
Fast forward as I wait in line for this passport
The homies was still poor, was working at Jansport

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre?
Even Vanessa from XXL had told him press play
And there goes my fate, now I'm on stage with Snoop
Gave me the torch and I ran with it in high pursuit
Rapped with my forefathers, even wreck it with Gaga too
Lyricist of the year, fuck am I supposed to do? Rock

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
Exaggerated shit that we rapped had came true
Thought I was aggravated, when Warner had let me loose
I was honest, see they was haunted when Mike Jones didn't recoup

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Cool, 'cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth
Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
I came, I saw, I conquered
No shame, I blame all of this on Compton
Thinkin' 'bout when Sherane tried to set me up
Cold game, full circle, they set up her
I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
The fight to ignite any wrong or right that I prolong
The story was short film, the glory of him and them
The worry of mothers that don't recover when baby's killed
The trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation
The view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who ain't make it
The angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?

[Intro]
Praise to the almighty, HiiiPower
Me and my niggas (Live forever)
3 eyes to my alumni
Feel this
I wanna hear it, turn me up (My niggas on point, game tight)
Turn me up a little bit more nigga (My niggas on point, game tight)
My nigga Cole in this motherfucker. Wassup nigga?
(My niggas on point, game tight)
There we go yeah, turn me up

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Picture plenty pussies throwing pellet guns at me
Paranoia make it more than difficult for me to sleep
Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got
But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of hip-hop
So retaliation is a must, when we bend the block
My niggas dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit
Walk inside the label, struck a match, and then I blew, bomb
C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere
I got three whores with me, it smells like Dior and derrière
Decoys die slow, you can detour to Heaven's stairs
Or walk inside Hell's dungeon, I just might derail something
They pussies, I smell something
You douche on the daily, niggas, you pushin' up daisy
I push the gas on the Mercedes, nigga
Came in this game with a Rolie chain, and a dream
Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga that thought Good Kid gon' flop, or that I might go pop
Or your bitch won't drop, knees when my shit drop
Y'all too infatuated with the fucking numbers
Which make it easy for me to divide and conquer
I come from Compton, we ain't have it all
Smokers basing inside the cafeteria hall
And I'm putting fear in you all, see your skeletons shaking
Jump out your body, you Ricky Bobby until you naked
Y'all pray to God this week I be putting out bombs
I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne
If not J. Cole, your shit is trash
But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
This is where we at? I guess it's entertainment
I guess this is speculation making a classic came with
If I ain't have the patience I'd probably self destruct
Real people want real music, the jig is up
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Your worst fear is confirmed
We love that you crashed and burned
The real is back
K. Dot it's your turn, take your victory lap
King Cole salutin' Compton's own King Kendrick
Thats the sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
The city hail King Kendrick Lamar
The world hail King Kendrick Lamar

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
This is my life and I look at it like its my last
And I'm lookin' right past the future as I reminisce on my past
And I don't even think how I used to, my mind is on rocket blast
And I don't even drink like I used too, and I don't even smoke
So you know this natural flow is for users that want to go to rehab
Lookin' at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them
Then but I won't say my bad, see I just lay in the cut
Watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what
See now we dump'n out the roof[Intro]
La da da, the look of lust, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Pleasure is a must
I'm sleeping here with lust, scenes of ménages with Asian massages
Sin is the sin of my apartment
She can feel the rhythm as I give her my guitar licks
Mmm... She never knew I was an artist
I play the instrument well in a dark lit room
Please baby gal don't pause this groove
Ever seen a flower in a darkness bloom?
I know you never have, love
And we all got is lust, we don't have love
I think this song started in the bathtub
Then the melody continued to a back rub
You told me your homegirl can play the sax, love
Well show me if she can play my notes perfectly, you're making me a fan
In between your smiles were the sounds of our whispers
As I'm looking down such a bountiful picture
I look at her, then look at you
And both of you make such a beautiful muse for this music
But this is not a Mozart movement, but baby girl keep your composure
I'm not done with composing, it's the look of lust

[Hook: Shalonda]
The look of lust is in your eyes
A look that you can't disguise
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Say she hate it when I'm super faded
Know that homie notice her body rather her conversation
Rushing, lusting sexual favors when the hours chasing
Midnight at 2 pm, a vampire in Jordan laces
Prey on the blood of the promiscuous
Panties on the premises, pantry full of condoms
Fuck your conscious, let's get intimate
She said, "Baby boy slow down
You know I move with diligence
You think that I'm a ho now and strip me from my innocence?"
Hmm...She was older, she was colder than the rest of 'em
Lurking over my shoulder, temptation getting the best of her
So much... I never knew how to touch a real woman
"Kendrick I want you to make me feel something."
Pulled down my pants and then she glanced at me with a smirk
Repeatedly shook my hand I said, "Whats wrong should I kiss it first?"
I can do that I won't complain
She said, "That ain't a problem I'm wet
But first you gotta fuck my brain like a surgeon
Get your mental working
Like a 9 to 5, before we get it live and close the curtains."
I thought a massage was all I need
Now proceed if it's worth it
Or leave if it's urgent
For you to rendez-vous, I know your needs have a purpose
Cause I have feelings too
And you have feelings, but that's only in your teeth when they're hurting
I started laughing
She pulled my card like pitty-pat
Pity the fool for any kitty-kat, it's the look of lust
[Hook]
The look of lust is in your eyes
A look that you can't disguise
Oh the look of lust is saying so much more than words could ever say

[Verse 3: Omen]
Walking through the streets, I met a palm reader
She told me I was wise beyond my years
Says I've been here before, well I guess that I'm just here for more of the lust
Will she keep this on the hush? I like the ones that never blush
Uh-uh, yeah, now you seduced by the serpent
Wine on your lips, I'm close enough to know that that's as fine as it gets
I'm in too deep and I'm diving for dinner
She lets me know that she's a synchronized swimmer
Blind-folded heckling, you can't see her
But I'm guessing that she's got the look of lust
Uh-uh, yea

[Hook]
The look of lust is in your eyes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I was down, bad, then my life switched (Then my life switched)
What a crisis, my Black Seville with no license (No license)
I was lifeless, I was deadweight, I was triflin' (I was triflin')
Then my eye twitched, then my hand shook, and my fist balled
Then my right wrist took a risk for us
Saw lightning that made titans (I was triflin')
With a pitchfork, we ate yo' food then got bent more
With excitement, big wars on my neck piece
VVS be fightin', move fast like loose jazz
I gotta race the world and be vibrant
No plates on my scrape, yeah, that's mando
Massaging the handle left hand on the candle (Huh)
I'm too high profile to drive Lambo, that there is a scandal
That man grab a handful (Huh)
Never been loved (Easy), bet I pull up (Beep beep)
I got a thing for her, I wanna fuck (Freaky)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (Easy)
I got a thing for her
I mean I get you niggas out the way right now today, you say so
Take the safe and doctor pay 'em aimin' 'fore the case closed
Operate, then meet the player move on then for escrow
Hol' up wait, since Section 8 that's on my day to day though
Man-Man don't shake hand, he pop shit (Out the way)
She stargaze out through the cosmic (Out the way)
Amped up, we blew out the metropolis (Out the way)
And I've been too involved, huh (Out the way)
And I got tens on call, huh (Out the way)
And you pretend you ball, huh

[Intro: Samples & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Alright y'all
I want y'all to put your hands together
And to bring on the brothers that bound to lay more dips in your hips
More glide in your stride
Chi city in the building
And Mr. Southside
And if you don't think it's next you got the wrong damn address

[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Fuck your love, motherfuck your love
That's what Sir John say
You can laugh all you want but he's right as hell
Cupid's ain't around these days
I've heard many stories about how he made people all around the world fall in love
Well I got a call just the other day
Telling me where Cupid was

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Cupid's too busy in the club
At the bar
Rolling up
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know, I'm sure
Boys and girls

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Love ain't dead
Stupid I'm the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
'Cause love's still alive
I said, Love ain't dead
Stupid I'm the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
'Cause love's still alive

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
The responsibility lies on me
Since Cupid ain't around
And when y'all really feeling like you're falling in love
When my music put's you right on down
And everybody (I see)
And I know (I know)
Some people really think they in love
But now without a love song
Something's gone way wrong

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Cupid's too busy in the club
At the bar
Rolling up
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know I'm sure
Boys and girls

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Love ain't dead
Stupid I'm the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
'Cause love's still alive
I said, Love ain't dead
Stupid I'm the the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
'Cause love's still alive
Love ain't dead

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
As I play out the Commodores, my faith destroyed
My heart don't work, I'm unemployed
The feeling is void, don't know what I need
Some pussy, some paper, some counseling
Maybe some Henny, some weed
I'm looking for you, I'm checking for her
I'm parking lot pimpin', I'm honking at women, I'm all on the curb
Skrt, skrt, skrt, pump my brake, pump my brake
Mini skirt, skirt, skirt, don't walk away, walk away
I'm fishing for compliments
This is a fairy tale, I know you very well
Fuck all your promises, I know what time it is
I'm just a realist, I am the realest
Reality is fatality cursed on the future for family, wife and some kids
I'm looking for you, I'm checking for her
I'm parking lot pimpin', I'm honking at women, I'm all on the curb
Skrt, skrt, skrt, pump your brake, pump your brake
Mini skirt, skirt, skirt, don't walk away, walk away (I promise)

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Cupid's too busy in the club
At the bar
Rolling up
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know I'm sure
Boys in the club
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know I'm sure
Boys and girls

[Skit]
Might sound weird
But a great night, you in a real relationship, you understand what I'm saying
A great night with somebody you love, is difficult
Somebody you like is always good
Like is wonderful
You come home with some juice, with the woman you like:
"Can I have some juice?"
"Gimme that juice, pour juice all over me"
Pour that juice all over that sexy body"
Let you be together three years and shit
"Can I have some juice?"
Bitch, why you want my juice?
You know I'm dehydrated
I try to come home and shit
Tryin' to get some juice you want my juice...



[Intro]
Oh, lord, oh, lord
Pretty ass girl over there, come play on ma nappy hair! (*Laugh*)
Drizzy Drake, here we go, look

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm gettin’ it how I live, I put that on my left rib
25 with no kids but this dick you can babysit
25 lighters in the sky, what life is a real nigga
20 Al-Qaeda bomb when I do sight 'fore I kill niggas
Passion my preference, Benjamin Franklin my medicine
The MVP let him in, I'ma fuck up his letterman
Jackets with pendants on them
And I got plenty war story, politic never depended on ’em
Uncle Sam never did shit for me, momma made miracles
Choppers drove me hysterical, cartoons and cereal
Pyramids on Imperial, that's the projects
And I make that progress from a tedious process
I'm a problem better yet a prospect, fuck that I'm a Loch Ness monster
Conquer, Compton, Hail King K-Dot, aka them casings of AK just sprayed your way uh, compensate for shooting for the stars muhafucka, click, brrt
Shooting up the charts, muhfucka
See, a rich nigga will buy anything that you sell 'em
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell 'em
I let smokers pump my gas, but I do that very seldom
Drop your ass at the unemployment, the only way I help 'em
They call me a role model, I'm still a baby myself
Hungover from last night, got to speak at your school at 12
Hennessy with the Sprite had me bouncing like Rumpelstiltskin
They caught me rummaging through women, I’m laughing like Elliott Wilson (*Laugh*)
Pay me respect and pay me on my checks
My first 50 thousand collected paid off some street debts
You know killers that looked out for me back when I was hungry
We go back like Reebok classics and black and blue saucony
I got a genuine clean slate, never you ask for my fucking rate
Never I’m handing out favors, bitch, every show now is 200k
As I write down my new bucket list, I can look down on your fucking hate
Get the fuck up when I'm in your presence, you listen when I fucking say

[Outro]
"What the fuck you niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!
Huh? Huh? Drizzy
What the fuck these niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!"

[Intro]
Bounce

[Verse 1]
Last night, you had the pink bike
Riding around, face bright, sunshine
I feel a bit tough, excitement
Care too much but don't feel like trying
What else should I be trying?
Should I tell her that I'm caring, rap about six flaws or maybe seven
Scary hiding from my problems
You not a problem but if you are we can solve it together
Write a few letters
Make a state together, don't change like the weather
Leave for good, or worse 'cause right now
Of course you're the store's favorite
Don't change at all just here me saying
Words that sound cheesy
Everyday at Mcy D's with a burger or cheesy fries to match
Supersize, any size, you a prize in my eyes
That's right

[Chorus]
How about some fries and cartoons tonight?
As long as I'm with you, I'ma be alright
I ain't tryna sound horny but please just adore me
Write our own love story and tell it to my shawtie
[Interlude]
Sounds right
I know it sounds right

[Refrain]
Your love, my love, sky love, high love
Make a blade say high love
Let's go and touch the sky love
But I would- your boobs so tough
Trigger max, so rough
It's all good with me love
But I would
Your love, my love, sky love, high love
Make a blade say high love
Let's go and touch the sky love
But I would- your boobs so tough
Trigger max, so rough
It's all good with me love
But I would

[Bridge]
But I would
But I would
But I would
But, but I would
[Chorus]
How about some fries and cartoons tonight?
As long as I'm with you, I'll be alright
I ain't tryna sound corny, I'll be alright
But please just call me
How about some fries and cartoons tonight?
As long as I'm with you, I'ma be alright
I ain't tryna sound horny but please just adore me

Wait, let me slow it down, flow so Matrix

Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress

E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo)
Solo but I'm never alone (that's right)
I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo)
Westside (easy call) I got three eyes man I see y'all
All I do is kill shit ICU, party with a few girls at USC
It's 82 degrees and my top off
And they top off, I'm getting topped off, Top Dawg
Women, weed, and weather what more can I say
To live and die in LA
Spend a week on Venice beach -
I'm 2Pac and Biggie Smalls

[Schoolboy Q]
Every morning nigga I get blazed (aye);
Women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored
Come and join the wave (aye);
Girl, what is your name
Cause I'm feeling your frame
Can I see what you bout (uh);
A little something in your rear
Little something in your mouth
Little something on your couch (uh);
Know now what I'm talkin' about, bring the coffin out
Cause I killed it, I done drilled it
She said she like it from the back like a real bitch (uh)
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo, I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe its no surprise
Bad hoes panties get left behind - I want your behind

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Dr. Dre)]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather (they come for)
Women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(from all around the world for the)
Women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather -
Don't it sound clever, come and play

[Intro]
Reporting live, Compton California
The good kid

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of doing it the same way
Gotta Flip it before I ruin it
Make it all make sense
Before you put your 2 in it
Opinions get thrown out the window
With Ron Browz so turn me up loud
So the world can hear
And when your favorite rapper
Be rapping you should cover your ears
And go deaf, go deaf I said
Go death and stay dead
A shot to the forehead'll kill em
But I ain't here for no ignorance
I’m militant, as Martin Luther King
In the penitent, aiming for my dreams
Till a bullet bounce off
One of my deep thoughts
And hit a nigga in the spleen
I got it in my genes
You probably think I'm talking bout a pistol
But I'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
My nigga what you worry for?
I ain't trying to jock your swag
I'm trying to better my craft and stay relevant

[Hook]
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring
I'ma
Tell you why
It's important
I'm not the boring, (I'ma)
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
What's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World
The Relevant

[Verse 2]
Id rather you call me that
Then a typical artist you call wack
On a Youtube blog holding AR's and stacks
Of one's but never could be the one
To rally communities or
Lead a crowd of blacks
Passion is to strong
Im pissed off
So there's a chance you get pissed on
R Kelly was in the wrong
But that dont make you an exempt
That dont make you a no go from hittin the fence
You ain't a blood and
Damn sure you ain't a crip
The crowd yell OH!
But I ain't a pimp
Im me, Im free as a 5 finger discount
See you on the flipside
Right after I dismount, if I
Ever feel like I ain't pushin myself
Ill find a cliff then push myself
Off the edge like a barber
At the tip of your head
Thats how I settle it
Life or death if I ain't relevant

[Hook]
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring
I'ma
Tell you why
It's important
I'm not the boring, (I'ma)
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
What's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World
The Relevant

[Verse 3]
So feel free to not mind me
If your used to boosters
Drug dealers and shooters its on wax
Cause most of yall niggas fabricate facts anyway
I could have easily cheat and let the 44 play
Like a 2 on 2 orgy
But I been there and it bores me
Got to the point where it did nothing for me
At 40 I want to afford not to record bullshit
In my story, and Im mad young so Id rather do it now
Before my careers done, this is pain plus glory
Victory is here, if I cried
You could see strength and pride in my tears
I do it for the kids, I do it for the 23
Hour lockdowns doin time in the pen
And my pen is the only thing I got for
Hip hop to change the game
They'll remember my name as the relevant

[Hook]
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring
I'ma
Tell you why
It's important
I'm not the boring, (I'ma)
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
What's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
(Woman moaning)
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk-
Sex

[Verse 1: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on)
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no
[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Life is full of up and downs
Twists and turns
But somehow we keep on steppin'

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
These walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment

Me? I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated

I mean it's still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around demolition might crush

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]
If these walls could talk (Step)
I can feel your (Step) reign when it cries, (Uh) gold lives inside of (Step) you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, (Uh) I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
These walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in

I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I rather miss them
I rather call, I rather diss them
I rather fall on you, put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition go crush

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]
If these walls could talk (Uh)
I can feel (Step) your reign when it cries (Chi-town step), gold lives inside of (Step) you
If these walls could talk (Step)
I love it (? step) when I’m in it, I love it when (? step) I’m in it
(Uh)

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
And reality is
Sometimes through these ups and downs
You gotta know when to lead or to follow
Keep steppin'
Chi-town

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Build accessories and stash them on the are

If these walls could talk (Yeah, hey)

(Yes)



[Intro: Jay Rock]
Let's start our program ladies and gentlemen
LET'S GO!
NYC baby, haha we here now haha
Let's get it in

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Watch her getting jumping like third grade barrettes
Let the beretta blow you die slow while I smoke on chron-ic
Try to throw salt homie like dry sweat gun powder flow through triceps
I'm more advanced got a corvette flow, I spit like Murcielago
Through precipitation I give rappers a sun tan
Rapping like a promotional van when I pull the drum out
Clap more than a Beatle fan, never heard a sound like THIS
I'm number one, you're forever number two like Siamese
This is New York rap on gold d's
Jay Rock proceed

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Get it in like IVs
My flow is not on radar, the K-9 D
Play y'all like chess, you can't check us, come correct
Or face a lyrical bomb threat
I bomb first like Makaveli in 9 6
The nine mili have you on your death bed sick
See really I'm a project baby
Niggas are going Barney [?] raised me
Crooked cops
Stop sign got a bullet whole, don't stop
Speed through it like a drag race, or get buried under the state
K.Dot

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Expose niggas for who they are
Under their white T might be halter tops
Rap fags, the black mag come with a complimentary black mask
Black Jason, red beam on the Glock
Money talks, I'm trying to have a life long conversation
Live like a silver spoon caucasian with a chain of hotel rooms across the nation
No home training, break 1,000,000 dollar vases
Here we go yo, here we go yo
I got the special kind of flow they call it Hip-Hop antidote
Murder MC's, if you're a rapper please check your pulse
(Hurry Up) too late
(Flat line) John Doe

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Dead than a motherfucker, Damn I'm a motherfucker
(BLUCKA BL-BLUCKA BLUCKA BL-BLUCKA)
Let his Momma suffer
I ball like the West Coast at Harlem Rucker
But at venice beach, jump shots I'm finna see
Fuck a drop top, that's how they killed Kennedy
I'm in a bronco, OJ in the city streets
With my AC on (With your AC on?)
Shit don't try to play me homes
Jump stupid, then ask to get filet mignon
I'ma break him in half (and I'ma dumbthe bones)
Spill out (Then light the blunt)
With the butt of the comb
I got a lock like riper
25 to lifers, walk in the yard and never fold in a riot
You know who we are, Top Dawg generals
I thank God for rap, my career was being a criminal
BLISS

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
New level Hip Hop
Where my shovel? Let me convince Nas
Dig a couple graves tell 'em that the new rap zombie is alive to invade
On the masses south central true best I
40 Glock stashes, buck 50 score left eye
Going back to Cali in a New York state of mind

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't wait
You know, nigga ain't never hopped on no, no subway train you know
Might catch the blue line or something
Metro Bus
125 St. down Rosecrans, 53 down central
Hahahaha, It's all new to us you know
Get out the hood for once
Statue of Liberty, I wanna see the fire on that motherfucker
The fire really burn in that motherfucker?
Heh, you see a nigga don't a nigga don't ever know and shit
I ain't never seen snow nigga
Southern California
Crenshaw, gangbanging can't slang it
I wanna see some NY fitteds
Get used to them L.A. cats, heh
Puerto Rican mamis, nigga don't got no puerto rican mamis, nigga we got Mexicans nigga
Straight up, haha

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I do is too alumni
I'ma take my time, I'ma master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a landmine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up, hold up, I ain't seen your kind before
See me as a dollar sign 'til I resign or you report
That I done you wrong, and I mean you know my home endeavors
Nigga right now, it's now or never
Nigga right now, I'm high as ever, but however...

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone

I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes

Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre
And they wanna tell me, I made it
Nigga I ain't made shit, if he gave me a handout
I'ma take his wrist and break it
Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo, chilling with two hoes in here
And they tie my laces, living the Matrix as them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad HiiiPower conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash old friends I no longer have

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up

A drizzly Sunday morning in Compton, the sky an un-California-ish gray. Into the parking lot of a local hamburger stand pulls a chromed-out black Mercedes SUV, driven by 27-year-old Kendrick Lamar, arguably the most talented rapper of his generation. there are a half-dozen guys from the neighborhood waiting to meet him: L, Turtle, G-Weed. "I grew up with all these cats," Lamar says. He nods to Mingo, a Compton-born sweetheart who is roughly the size of the truck he arrived in: "I don't need to hire a bodyguard. Look how fucking big he is!" The burger joint, Tam's, sits at the corner of Rosecrans and Central, a famous local spot recently made infamous when Suge Knight allegedly ran over two men with his truck in the parking lot, killing one of them. "Homey died right here," G-Weed says, pointing to a dark spot on the asphalt. "That security camera caught everything. They're building a case."

Lamar grew up just six blocks from here, in a little blue three-bedroom house at 1612 137th St. Across the street is the Louisiana Fried Chicken where he used to get the three-piece meal with fries and lemonade; over there is the Rite Aid where he walked to buy milk for his little brothers. Tam's was another hangout. "This is where I seen my second murder, actually." he says. "Eight years old, walking home from McNair Elementary. Dude was in the drive-thru ordering his food, and homey ran up, boom boom - smoked him." He saw his first murder at age five, a teenage drug dealer gunned down outside Lamar's apartment building. "After that," he says, "you just get numb to it."

It's almost noon, but Lamar is just starting his day - having spent a late night in the studio scrambling to finish his new album, To Pimp a Butterfly, which has to be done in five days. He's dressed casually in a gray hoodie, maroon sweatpants, and white socks with black slides, but recognizable enough that an old lady in line decides to tease him while complaining about the heat inside. "Y'all need to put the air conditioner on," she calls to the manager. "Kendrick Lamar is here!"

Lamar may be a two-time Grammy winner with a platinum debut executive-produced by Dr. Dre, and with fans from Kanye West to Taylor Swift. But here at Tam's, he's also Kendrick Duckworth, Paula and Kenny's son. Inside, a middle-aged woman who just left church comes up and gives him a hug, and he buys lunch for a cart-toting lady he knows used to be a harmless crack addict. ("She used to chase us with sticks and stuff, he says.) Outside, an old man in a motorized wheelchair scoots over to introduce himself. He says he moved here in 1951, when Compton was still majority-white. "Back in the day, we had the baddest cars in L.A.," he says. "I just wanted you to know where you came from. It's a hell of a neighborhood."

On his breakthrough album, 2012's good kid, m.A.A.d City, Lamar made his name by chronicling this neighborhood, vividly evoking a specific place (this same stretch of Rosecrans) and a specific time (in the summer of 2004, between 10th and 11th grade). It was a concept album about adolescence, told with cinematic precision through the eyes of someone young enough to recall every detail (as in: "Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota/A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, one orange soda")

Lamar's parents moved here from Chicago in 1984, three years before Kendrick was born. His dad, Kenny Duckworth, was reportedly running with a South Side street gang called the Gangster Disciples, so his mom, Paula Oliver, issued an ultimatum. "She said, 'I can't fuck with you if you ain't trying to better yourself,'" Lamar recounts. "'We can't be in the streets forever.'" They stuffed their clothes in two black garbage bags and boarded a train to California with $500. "They were going to go to San Bernardino," Lamar says. "But my Auntie Tina was in Compton. She got 'em a hotel until they got on their feet, and my mom got a job at McDonald's." For the first couple of years, they slept in their car or motels, or in the park when it was hot enough. "Eventually, they saved enough money to get their first apartment, and that's when they had me."

Lamar has a lot of good memories of Compton as a kid: riding bikes, doing back flips off friends' roofs, sneaking into the living room during his parents' house parties. ("I'd catch him in the middle of the dance floor with his shirt off," his mom says. "Like, 'What the...? Get back in that room!'") Then there's one of his earliest memories - the afternoon of April 29th, 1992, the first day of the South Central riots

Kendrick was four. "I remember riding with my pops down Bullis Road, and looking out the window and seeing motherfuckers just running," he says. "I can see smoke. We stop, and my pops goes into the AutoZone and comes out rolling four tires. I know he didn't buy them. I'm like, 'What's going on?'" (Says Kenny, "We were all taking stuff. That's the way it was in the riots!")

"Then we get to the house," Lamar continues, "and him and my uncles are like, 'We fixing to get this, we fixing to get that, we fixing to get all this shit!' I'm thinking they're robbing. There's some real mayhem going on in L.A. Then, as time progresses, I'm watching the news, hearing about Rodney King and all this, I said to my mom, 'So the police beat up a black man, and now everybody's mad? Ok. I get it now.'"

We've been sitting on the patio a while when Lamar sees someone he knows at the bus stop. "Matt Jeezy! What up, bro?" Matt Jeezy nods. "That's my boy," Lamar says. "He's part of the inner circle." Lamar has a few friends like this, guys he's known all his life. But often he'd rather be by himself

"He was always a loner," Kendrick's mom says. Lamar agrees: "I was always in the corner of the room watching." He has two little brothers and one younger sister, but until he was seven, he was an only child. He was so precocious his parents nicknamed him Man-Man. "I grew up fast as fuck," he says. "My moms used to walk me home from school - we didn't have no car - and we'd talk from the county building to the welfare office." "He would ask me questions about Section 8 and the Housing Authority, so I'd explain it to him," his mom says. "I was keeping it real."

The Duckworths survived on welfare and food stamps, and Paula did hair for $20 a head. His dad had a job at KFC, but at a certain point, says Lamar, "I realized his work schedule wasn't really adding up." It wasn't until later that he suspected Kenny was probably making money off the streets. "They wanted to keep me innocent," Lamar says now. "I love them for that." To this day, he and his dad have never discussed it. "I don't know what type of demons he has," Lamar says, "but I don't wanna bring them shits up." (Says Kenny, "I don't want to talk about that bad time. But I did what I had to do.")

There's a famous story from Tom Petty's childhood in which a 10-year-old Tom sees Elvis shooting a movie near his hometown in Florida, takes on look at the white Cadillac and the girls, and decides to become a rock star on the spot. Lamar has a similar story - only for him it's sitting on his dad's shoulders outside the Compton Swap Meet, age eight, watching Dr. Dre and 2Pac shoot a video for "California Love." "I want to say they were in a white Bentley," Lamar says. (It was actually black.) "These motorcycle cops trying to conduct traffic but one almost scraped the car, and Pac stood up on the passenger seat, like, 'Yo, what the fuck!'" He laughs. "Yelling at the police, just like on his motherfucking songs. He gave us what we wanted."
Being a rapper was far from preordained for Lamar. As late as middle school, he had a noticeable stutter. "Just certain words," he says. "It came when I was excited or in trouble." He loved basketball - he was short, but quick - and dreamed of making it to the NBA. But in seventh grade, an English teacher named Mr. Inge turned him on to poetry - rhymes, metaphors, double-entendres - and Lamar fell in love. "You could put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and they'd make sense to you," he says. "I liked that."

At home, Lamar started writing non-stop. "We used to wonder what he was doing with all that paper," his dad says. "I thought he was doing homework! I didn't know he was writing lyrics." "I had never heard him say profanity before," says his mom. "Then I found his little rap lyrics, and it was all 'Eff you.' 'D-i-c-k.' I'm like, 'Oh, my God! Kendrick's a cusser!'"

An A student, Lamar flirted with the idea of going to college. "I could have went. I should have went." (He still might: "It's always in the back of my mind. It's not too late.") But by the time he was in high school, he was running with a bad crowd. This is the crew he raps about on good kid, m.A.A.d City - the ones doing robberies, home invasions, running from the cops

Once his mom found a bloody hospital gown, from a trip he took to the ER with "one of his little homeys who got smoked." Another time she found him curled up crying in the front yard. She thought he was sad because his grandmother had just died: "I didn't know somebody had shot at him." One night, the police knocked on their door and said he was involved in an incident in their neighborhood, and his parents, in a bout of tough love, kicked him out for two days. "And that's a scary thing," Lamar says, "because you might not come back."

After a couple of hours, the mood on Rosecrans starts to shift. An ambulance roars by, sirens blaring. In the middle of the street, a homeless man is shouting at passing cars. Lamar starts to grow uneasy, his eyes glancing at the corners. I ask if everything's OK. "It's the temperature," he says. "It's uh, raising a little bit." A few minutes later, one of his friends - who's been cruising back and forth on his bicycle all afternoon, "patrolling the perimeter" - calls out, "Rollers!" and a few seconds later, two L.A. County sherrif cruisers round the corner. "There they go," Lamar says, as they hit their lights and take off

As a teenager, "the majority of my interactions with police were not good," Lamar says. "There were a few good ones who were actually protecting the community. But then you have ones from the Valley. They never met me in their life, but since I'm a kid in basketball shorts and a white T-shirt, they wanna slam me on the hood of the car. Sixteen years old," he says, nodding toward the street. "Right there by that bus stop. Even if he's not a good kid, that don't give you the right to slam a minor on the ground, or pull a pistol on him."

Lamar says he's had police pull guns on him on two occasions. The first was when he was 17, cruising around Compton with his friend Moose. He says a cop spotted their flashy green Camaro and pulled them over, and when Moose couldn't find his license fast enough, the cop pulled a gun. "He literally put the beam on my boy's head," Lamar recalls. "I remember driving off in a silence, feeling violated, and him being so angry a tear dropped from his eye." The story of the second time is murkier: Lamar won't say what he and his friends were up to, only that a cop drew his gun and they ran. "We was in the wrong," he admits. "But we just kids. It's not worth pulling your gun out over. Especially when we running away."

Friends of his weren't so lucky. Just after midnight on June 13th, 2007, officers from the LAPD's Southeast Division responded to a domestic-violence call on East 120th Street, about five minutes from Lamar's house. There, they found his good friend D.T. allegedly holding a 10-inch knife. According to police, D.T. charged, and an officer opened fire, killing him. "It never really quite added up," Lamar says. "But here's the crazy thing. Normally when we find out somebody got killed, the first thing we say is 'Who did it? Where we gotta go?' It's a gang altercation. But this time it was the police - the biggest gang in California. You'll never win against them."

On an otherwise positive song called "Hiiipower," from his 2011 mixtape Section.80, Lamar rapped, "I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol/Aim it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is going to miss you." It's an unsettling line, especially coming from a rapper who often subverts gangster tropes but rarely trafficks in them. "I was angry," he says. "To be someone with a good heart, and to still be harassed as a kid...it took a toll on me. Soon you're just saying, 'Fuck everything.' That line was me getting those frustrations out. And I'm glad I could get them out with a pen and a paper."

About three years ago, Lamar was flipping through the channels on his tour bus when he saw on the news a report that a 16-year old named Trayvon Martin had been shot to death in a Florida subdivision. "It just put a whole new anger inside me," Lamar says. "It made me remember how I felt. Being harassed, my partners being killed." He grabbed a pen and started writing, and within an hour, he had rough verses for a new song, "The Blacker the Berry":Coming from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big
My nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people
Your plan is to terminate my culture...But as soon as Lamar wrote, he also started thinking about his own time in the streets and "all the wrong I've done." So he started writing a new verse, in which he turned the microscope on himself. How can he criticize America for killing young black men, he asks, when young black men are often just as good at it? As the song's narrator put it, "Why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street/When gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?/Hypocrite"

When it was finally released last month, the song sparked a rash of think pieces, with some listeners saying Lamar was ignoring the real problem: the systemic racism that created the conditions for black-on-black crime in the first place. Coupled with a recent Billboard interview in which Lamar seemed to suggest that some of the responsibility for preventing killings like that of Michael Brown lay with black people themselves, some fans thought he sounded like a right-wing apologist. The rapper Azealia Banks called his comments "the dumbest shit I've ever heard a black man say."
Lamar says he's not an idiot. "I know the history," he says. "I'm not talking about that. I'm talking from a personal standpoint. I'm talking about gangbanging

He grew up surrounded by gangs. Some of his close friends were West Side Pirus, a local Blood affiliate, and his mom says her brothers were Compton Crips. One of his uncles did a 15-year stretch for robbery, and another is locked up now for the same; his Uncle Tony, meanwhile, was shot in the head at a burger stand when kendrick was a boy. But Lamar says he was taught that change starts from within. "My moms always told me: 'How long you gonna play the victim?'" he says. "I can say I'm mad and I hate everything, but nothing really changes until I change myself. So no matter how much bullshit we've been through as a community, I'm strong enough to say fuck that, and acknowledge myself and my own struggles."

When Lamar released the new album's first single, "i," last September, many fans weren't sure what to make of it. A blast of pop positivity that samples an Isley Brothers hit recently heard soundtracking a Swiffer commercial, it felt like an odd move for Lamar, who's known for more complex fare. People called it corny, mocked its feel-good, "Happy"-style chorus ("I love myself!"). "I know people might think that means I'm conceited or something," Lamar says. "No. It means I'm depressed."

Lamar is sitting in the Santa Monica recording studio where he made much of his new album, dressed in a charcoal sweatsuit and Reeboks. His baseball cap is pulled low over his sprouting braids, and he speaks softly and thoughtfully, with long pauses between sentences

"I've woken up in the morning and felt like shit," he says. "Feeling guilty. Feeling angry. Feeling regretful. As a kid from Compton, you can get all the success in the world and still question your worth."

Lamar says he intended "i" as a "Keep Ya Head Up"-style message for his friends in the penitentiary. But he also wrote it for himself, to ward off dark thoughts. "My partner Jason Estrada told me, 'If you don't attack it, it will attack you,'" Lamar says. "If you sit around moping, feeling sad and stagnant, it's gonna eat you alive. I had to make that record. It's a reminder. It makes me feel good."

Lamar also points out that the fans who scratched their heads at "i" had yet to hear "u" - its counterpoint on the album. "'i' is the answer to 'u,'" he says. The latter is four and a half minutes of devastating honesty, with Lamar almost sopping over a discordant beat, berating himself about his lack of confidence and calling himself "a fucking failure." It's the sound of a man staring into the mirror and hating what he sees, punctuated by a self-aware hook: "Loving you is complicated."

"That was one of the hardest songs I had to write," he says. "There's some very dark moments in there. All my insecurities and selfishness and letdowns. That shit is depressing as a motherfucker. But it helps, though," he says. "It helps."

Lamar has documented his inner struggles before, most notably on "Swimming Pools," from good kid, which explores his past troubles with alcohol and his family's history of addiction. But once he got successful, he says, things got more difficult, not less. One of his biggest issues was self esteem - accepting that he deserved to be where he was. And some of that came from his discomfort around white people

"I'm going to be 100 percent real with you," Lamar says. "In all my days of schooling, from preschool all the way up to 12th grade, there was not one white person in my class. Literally zero." Before he started touring, he had barely left Compton; when he finally did, the culture shock threw him. "Imagine only discovering that when you're 25," Lamar says. "You're around people you don't know how to communicate with. You don't speak the same lingo. It brings confusion and insecurity. Questioning how did I get here, what am I doing? That was a cycle I had to break quick. But at the same time, you're excited, because you're in a different environment. The world keeps going outside the neighborhood."

The week good kid was released, Lamar began keeping a diary. "It really came from the conversations I had with Dre," he says. "Hearing him tell stories about all these moments, and how it went by like that" - he snaps. "I didn't want to forget how I was feeling when my album dropped, or when I went back to Compton."

Lamar ended up filling multiple notebooks. "There's a lot of weird shit in there," he says. "Lot of drawings, visuals." Where as good kid was an exercise in millennial nostalgia, To Pimp a Butterfly is firmly in the present. It's his take on what it means to be young and black in America today - and more specifically, what it means to be Kendrick Lamar, navigating success, expectation and his own self-doubt

Musically, the album - at least the half that he's comfortable sharing so far - is adventurous, borrowing from free jazz and 1970s funk. Lamar says he listened to a lot of Miles Davis and Parliament. His producer Mark "Sounwave" Spears, who's known Lamar since he was 16, says, "Every producer I've ever met was sending me stuff - but there was a one-in-a-million chance you could send us a beat that actually fit what we were doing." Ali says Lamar works synesthetically - "He talks in colors all the time: 'Make it sound purple.' 'Make it sound light green.'"
But of all the album's colors, the most prominent is black. There are allusions to the entire sweep of African-American history, from the dispora to the cotton fields to the Harlem renaissance to Obama. "Mortal Man" (inspired in part by a 2014 trip to South Africa) name-checks leaders from Mandela to MLK all the way back to moses. On "King Kunta," a stomping blast of James Brown funk, he imagines himself as the titular slave from Roots, shouting the punchline "Everybody wanna cut the legs off him!/Black man taking no losses!"

Hanging over it all, of course, are the tragedies of the past three years: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice. Says Sounwave, "To me, the album is perfect for right now. If the world was happy, maybe we'd give you a happy album. But right now, we are not happy."

Lamar - who calls the album "fearful, honest and unapologetic" - is coy about what the title means. "Just putting the word 'pimp' next to 'butterfly'..." he says, then laughs. "It's a trip. That's something that will be a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses - I truly believe that." I ask if he's the pimp or the butterfly, and he just smiles. "I could be both," he says

On the last day of February, Lamar and two dozen loved ones are gathered at a $6 million mansion in Calabasas, for a surprise birthday party for Sounwave. The estate belongs to "Top Dawg" Tiffeth, part of a group of properties so exclusive they're protected by two security gates, the second presumably to keep out the riff-raff inhabiting the mansions inside the first. NBA star Paul Pierce lives across the street, and multiple Kardashians live around the block. There's probably a million dollars in this driveway," says Lamar's tour manager, a friendly dude named retOne, as he surveys the Audis, Benzes and Range Rovers out front

Lamar lives down the coast with his longtime girlfriend, Whitney (he has called her his "best friend"), in a tri-level condo he rents in the South Bay, on the water. He still hasn't splurged on much: So far his biggest purchase is a relatively modest house in the suburbs east of L.A., which he bought for his parents more than a year ago. Top Dawg says that at first his mom didn't want to take it, because it meant giving up their Section 8 status. Kendrick had to reassure her: "It's OK, Mom. We're good." ("It was hard times, and we've been through a lot," says Kenny. "But like Drake said: 'We started from the bottom, now we're here.'")

In the kitchen, the girls are snacking and chatting, while the guys are in the home theater watching the new Kobe documentary. In the dining room, Lamar is talking to Sounwave and his manager Dave Free, trying to make last-minute changes to the record that's due out in two weeks

Eventually, Whitney comes in and rests her hand on Lamar's shoulder. "They're about the blow out the candles," she says. Everyone moves into the kitchen to sing "Happy Birthday" to Sounwave, and Lamar stands beside Whitney, his arm around her waist. They look happy. Sounwave is about to blow out the candles when someone tells him to make a wish - but before he can, Lamar jumps in and makes one for him. "I wish," he says, smiling, "for hot beats!"[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid] x2
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

[Interlude]
Then there's a lot of funky things in this country
And there's a lot of good things too
But there's more funky than good
We've changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all

[Verse 1: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Walking down the street
Foggy eyes
Looking at the sky
Starry eyes
Searching for a place
Weary eyes
Crying in the night
Teary eyes
[Hook] x2

[Interlude]
Dude, we got to get our minds together!
Anytime a brother was shot another brother in his own neighborhood
Then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket
They need to have the police down there
Cause see the niggas is N.A.A.C.P
Niggas ain't actin' like colored people
If I can't work and make it, I steal and take it
They come up to me with a nigga who can put air in a bottle and sell it
He can do it man
A nigga can sell anything

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
As I watch the sky change colors
The rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
The black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
Another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
The street runners got the same legs of Michael Johnson
The fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
Profanity in the air, the children use the content
The vanity's in the air, that Louis bag: haunted
The black girl with the hair, that's kind of coarse
Her baby daddy's in court, she smoking on a Newport
Seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
Or becoming an AIDS victim while touching them zippers
The life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
How can an angel forever live in sin?
[Hook] x4

[Outro]
You know, anybody that uses somebody else to gain is pimpin'
Well, I tell you what soul brother, lookie here
Can't nobody pimp you but your pimp ass self
You understand?
Then there's a lot of funky things in this country
And there's a lot of good things too
But there's more funky than good
Shit ain't gettin' better
We've changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all[Intro]
Kids is what make me feel so good
See you looking at the glory that's coming up into the future of life
See the younger youth is what's gonna make everything to keep going
After I done passed down the hill
Young and black!

[Verse 1: Marcus Eugene]
Uh, young, gifted and I'm black
Uh, young, gifted and I rap
Young and gifted, but I don't got a strap
So I hope nobody try to run up on me with the mac
Like "blat!"
Lay a nigga flat
But let me fall back cause I ain't into all that
As I get back to the trap
When I say I'm trappin', that just mean I'm tryna stack
Tryin' not to get caught up where I'm at
In the 'jects where the mice gettin' cheese with the rats
That's where I be's, and these is the facts
The world is a ghetto, we all know who's Geppetto
Angel on your shoulder, in your ear you got the devil
People change like leaves that them dope boys peddle
Blow trees like flowers in the meadow
Life's a breeze, you know me, I'm just tryin' not to settle
Cause these streets still cold like metal
When it's heat, it ain't sweet
And them shots ain't Jell-O
So, props to them niggas takin' shots like Melo
From the block, just tryna meet the top like "hello!"
Uh, then we sayin' our good-byes
Glory for the villains, no love for the good guys
A system of bad people that's tellin' us good lies
That's life as you know it, you lookin' through hood eyes
[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

[Interlude]
Then there's a lot of funky things in this country
And there's a lot of good things too
But there's more funky than good
We've changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all

[Verse 2: Starks]
From a ghetto where fathers don't even father
Mothers don't even bother
'Less it's about a lotto
Do anything for a dollar
Yeah, they givin' head just to get ahead
Provin' they ain't thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
They bottle full of sorrow
Pain is deeper than cargo pockets
I wouldn't knock it, I just want better for my note
Yeah, I know we all different
But we'll always be the same 'til we change our endin'
Man, we gotta change our mind before we change our livin'
And if we never change our mind we in the same position
But niggas is niggas
And bitches, well, they still bitches
Instead of brothers and sisters
Man, this shit is ridiculous
I guess I'm still ridiculous
Hollerin' at shorty like "hey, yo, let me get yo' digits"
Then a man get offended
Then a pistol get grippin'
And he shoot and he missin'
He don't care who he hittin'
Another senseless victim
All from ghetto livin'
[Hook]
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

[Interlude]
Dude, we got to get our minds together!
Anytime a brother was shot another brother in his own neighborhood
Then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket
They need to have the police down there
Cause see the niggas is N.A.A.C.P
Niggas ain't actin' like colored people
If I can't work and make it, I steal and take it
They come up to me with a nigga who can put air in a bottle and sell it
He can do it man
A nigga can sell anything

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
As I watch the sky change colors
The rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
The black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
Another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
The street runners got the same legs of Michael Johnson
The fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
Profanity in the air, the children use the content
The vanity's in the air, that Louis bag: haunted
The black girl with the hair, that's kind of coarse
Her baby daddy's in court, she smoking on a Newport
Seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
Or becoming an AIDS victim while touching them zippers
The life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
How can an angel forever live in sin?
[Hook]
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

[Outro]
You know, anybody that uses somebody else to gain is pimpin'
Well, I tell you what soul brother, lookie here
Can't nobody pimp you but your pimp ass self
You understand?
Then there's a lot of funky things in this country
And there's a lot of good things too
But there's more funky than good
Shit ain't gettin' better
We've changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep them big ol' 26s on deck
And the bitches they be on it

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep them big ol' 26's on deck
Stock 'lac gotta fresh paint pussy juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I pull up on them hoes, roll my windows down
Let my music out, four 15s shake the ground
Smoking on that medical, sipping on some medicine
Top Dawg letterman, she wanna ride, I let her in
She sexy than a motherfucker, plus, she brought her best friend
I guess that's a two for one, party at the Weston
Five star suites, bottles everywhere
Wanna fuck a star on the moon? I could take you there, biatch
I got a swagger of Mick Jagger
If you want her, you can have her, I done had her, we done had her
They be shooting at my ladder 'cause I’m standing on a pedestal
She gon' give me good head just cause I’m ahead of you
Jay Rock, flyer than Hancock, no shit
I’m a king, fuck a prince, I don’t know no Will Smith
I don’t owe you niggas shit, I’m a self-made nigga
Ain’t that’s why your bitch let me fuck on her for days nigga?
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep them big ol' 26’s on deck
Stock 'lac gotta fresh paint pussy juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Catch me in that fast lane, burners like I’m Max Payne
Married to that money, bitch, women want my last name
They be on my bumper, mayne, screaming out "OMG!"
Oh, I be P-I-M-P, 2-P-A-C, that's M.O.B
Him or me? You choose, I ain’t gotta do too much
I just lay back, smoke my weed, and turn my bottle up
Candy paint, leather guts, slide through like an avalanche
We don’t ride no Avalanche, so high I might never land
Trips to Never-Neverland, smoking on Afghanistan
A.K.A. that kush, nigga, I’m on Heaven’s roof, nigga
Big dawg, I go WOOF, nigga, don’t make me let my goons loose
Choppers make you shit your pants, thought you drunk some prune juice
Swear that I’m immune to, stuntin hard, gettin paper
Owning land, buyin acres, that's the reason why they hate us
I don’t give a fuck, middle finger out the window
Beamer, Benz or Bentley, Ferrari, sorry, we Enzo
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep them big ol' 26’s on deck
Stock 'lac, gotta fresh paint pussy-juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
187, I’m killin em' when I’m whipping it
Touch a corner, it's a murder, wipe my fingerprints
I thought I told y'all, used to have them packs
In a black Toyota, Macs by my scrotum
Now it's matchbox Hot Wheels when I roll up
Always online, stay connected like a modem
He tryna snap a picture, she 'bout to snap her neck
A real Blood pull up in a cherry cherry X
400 horses, Hollywood park it
Chevy kinda awkward, interior green and coffee
I shake them haters off me, as if I had fleas
I'm a Top Dawg, rare breed
Shoutout to Rare Breed, they keep them hogs running
And my garage is like the show, I keep them cars comin'
You hear my name hummin' in the streets, buzz big
Got ya bitch eyes rolling like my rims is
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep them big ol' 26’s on deck
Stock 'lac gotta fresh paint pussy-juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh

DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: J Cole]
And you know it don't stop, grindin' 'round that clock
Masterminding my second album, my first album just dropped
Scored a touchdown on my first down, niggas thought I was gon' flop
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops, ha
And we still duckin' cops, ride around and take shots
Hennessy for my enemies, niggas know I'm takin' they spot
'Cause that score up on the play clock show just how I came from way back
Just like T-I-P told you—ASAP; but you niggas rappin' like Aesop, Aesop, get a grip!

[Pre-Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit!
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas

[Chorus: J. Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes saying anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world: twice, to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever! Ha
They say they ready for whatever

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yuh, yuh, Young Krizzle
Shawty look what we got, my bass beat and it knock (It knock)
Got the old school in my old school was to post up on your block (Your block)
Yo broad chose like she was s'posed to and you up in arms 'cause she bopped (She bopped)
Cole I hate to say it but I got to say that I wish that they would just stop (Whoa)
So fuck these haters, fuck these hoes that ain't slammin' doors on they drop (Whoa)
Y'all niggas too young to remember how to the South used to be, but I'm not (Whoa)
So when it come to snappin', Cadillacs, SpottieOttieDopaliscious, y'all pop (Whoa)
You thought Krit Wuz Here and R4 were the shit? Bitch, wait 'til my album drop (Get 'em girls)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Say that's your new car? Nigga, that's my old slab
Say that's your new bitch? Nigga, that's my old stab
Oh that's yo new flow? That shit sound so trash
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Hol' up...but don't forget about Compton, nigga!
One for the money, two for the show
Three for No Limit and the rest for Death Row
That means I been 'bout it 'bout it and this is the realest shit I ever wrote
And if anyone ever doubt it, then they are the loudest of liars I know
I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
And I hope that my dick is a whistling flute, and that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, I'll drag your ass to the floor
Bitch, I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor, I'm needing your lips, yeah
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it, then I won't ignore it, clear
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right, when I floor it, that's when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, ugh, keeping one foot in your anus, ugh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, ugh
Bitch I'm demanding respect, these bitches is telling me, "Take it"
DJ Khaled, even if I had callus, holding the torch ain't no challenge, ain't it? Ooh, huhuhu

[Chorus: J. Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes saying anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world: twice, to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever! Ha
They say they ready for whatever



[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Growin up I was a knucklehead
Boy you never listen to me!
Thats what my momma said
Im from the projects
I ain't never had shit
Me and my older brother
We had to share a mattress
No heat, no lights
Had to keep them candles lit
My daddy left me at 8
In an out my life and shit
Gang bangas dope dealers replaced my father
Neighborhood hustlas taught me to get them dollars
Thats when I became a problem
Product of my environment
It's hard to grow up be a doctor or a fireman
When you constantly seein that g ride tires screeching
And them shots firin all the time it happens frequently
The hood inspired him, to be a G
I bled for the game did it all for the letter B
The big homie gave me the name jay rock
This ain't no rap gimmick
It's a real life story on watts livin nigga

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can take, me out the hood, but you can't take the hood out me
And that's the way it will forever be
And I can’t help it i’m gutter
Why should I change now
When all my life I been gang banged out
That project shit run deep in my veins now
And I can’t help it
Ooh my lord knows that I can’t help it

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Let me take you on a detour
East side watts
Niggas will go in projects
Follow me home to my black and white apartments
Police roll thru with caution, scared to death
The homies got tats across them
Capitol BH over they necks
Since birth banging the set
Even the hoes banging the set
Some ain't, but most is hood rats
That looking for that buck
Them trash cans lay in the street
Ghetto technique for drive bys
For the low them 5 dollas will get you high
Dice games, YGs, fist fights
Six fo's, el co's, g rides, and mini bikes
Might see a couple of zombies late night
Off what? off pipe membrane dead right
No lie something in the bushes
Either the AK or the .45, no lie
Raised in the ghetto
With rats and roaches
Smokers on porches
Getting high off yola
It's colder north
But my city's the coldest
Where we ain't promised to see the morning, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
You could take me out the hood
But the hood will never leave me
I'm still bangin
I'm still hangin
The only difference is
I'm not slangin
Nickels and dimes
More like slanging these rap lines
Verses of truth
When I step in the booth
Niggas know I pour my soul out for the struggling youth
For that fatherless son who needed love so he ran with a crew
Grew up before his older brother did
Gin and juice
Replaced the pain I knew
Carrying them thangs to school
Them niggas was tripping I wasn't bangin the blue
But they had to respect me
I never ran from who?
Nobody, put my faith in god
It's amazin how I overcame them odds
On my momma this past year my life has slightly been revised
But notice I said slightly
Cuz me being absent from where I came from
That's unlikely

[Hook]



[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Compton Kendrick, something splendid
Yeah I'm in this B-I-itch
No I.D., I be a G, exclude every other alphabet
Every time I D.I.P., I need all of my Ruffle chips
Duffle bag full of Frito Lay, it'll be okay
Don't call OJ because I'm on some killer shit
K Dot in his killer whip
K Dot with his killer dime broadcasted on Channel 9
Lay back, let my seat recline
Rolling like 2 miles per hour
I was with success, I don't know where y'all were
You see it's funny how I do this thing
Throw 'em in the pond cause these pawns wish they knew this king
Say they word is bond like Double 07's service team
They be head servicing, get off my dick
I lay it down so cold, you would swore that I was half Eskimo
In bucket seats below zero
Oh it's me, I'm showing out, I get it crackin'
They never fill my void when I'm absent

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I come through, through, through, through
They be on it so thirsty, thirsty
Hoes they be boppin' so thirsty, thirsty
Haters they be watching so thirsty
Yeah, you too, too, too
You be on it so thirsty, thirsty
Hoes they be boppin' so thirsty, thirsty
Haters they be watching so thirsty

[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]
Why you always acting funny
Ain't never got no money
You say you dope, but you's a dummy
Lying to the hoes and your homies
About you're doing this and that
Saying always who ya with
Nigga, you thirsty
Nigga, you's a bitch, bitch, bitch
See all the time that you spending
Runnin' 'round town, pillow talking and hating on me
You need to stop talking bout me
Cause your bitch want a guy like me
And you wanna be me, but you can't can't
And you ain't, ain't, ain't

[Hook]

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
Man you niggas forever thirsty
Doing suicides in the desert in Albuquerque
I'm a fundraiser for Kanye
Cause I got them good bars, but I ain't selling Hershey's
Emperor like Xerces
Niggas say they players but ain't never had a jersey
King James, I'm a legend way before my thirties
Sent from the heavens, I'm a reverend to you clergies
I swear I do you dirty
Covered in that purple got me feeling like Percy
Harvin, got these rappers starving at my mercy
No disrespect to Terrace Martin
But I run circles round these tracks like Kentucky Derby
You see me with a white bitch, you swear I'm fucking Fergie
Putting money in a safe, look like I'm stuffing a turkey
Plus the way that I be dressing got your girl down south
Like the state that I be repping
She slurps me, til I'm dehydrated
Elated, blowing on this 3-5, faded
New clothes, you never see my Levi's faded
Bitch I'm buzzing like a bee hive, East Side's greatest
Now I'm working with producers
That I never thought that I would work with in the future
Underground cause my verse is in the sewer
Thirsty ass niggas, there's beverages in the cooler
Loser!

[Intro: 2Pac]
The only way I've been practicing my whole life is to be responsible for what I do. I don't know how to be responsible for what every black male did. I don't know. Yes I am gonna say that I'm a thug, that's because I came from the gutter and I'm still here

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
I'm a mothafuckin' thug, I hate payin' taxes
Just hate it, I'm tryna fuck a couple actresses
If I don't got it I'ma make it
Still don't got it, I'ma take it
Run that shit, take your shit, that's what I won't do
Out here doin' what I want to
Nigga you do what you can
That's the difference, I'm a mothafuckin' man
I'm a man, nigga, and as a man I don't take that
I don't do Versace, that's that gay shit
Yeah I said it, I'm a thug
I'm a thug, nigga, guess I need a mothafuckin' hug
Well dig my mama up and tell her give me one
Lotta niggas say they're real, I'm the realest one
I'm the realest, this exactly how I'm feelin', bruh
Ain't no chillin', bruh

[Hook: Glasses Malone]
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
[Verse 2: Glasses Malone]
It's all about the Benjamins
Nigga, fuck George Zimmerman
How it's pistol versus hand?
Take your whoopin' like a mothafuckin' man
Pussy, damn, how hard can a kid hit?
And why them local rappers ain't did shit?
Lil Wayne said, "Fuck the Heat"
Same local rapper niggas wanted beef
Fun, brother versus brother
No hesitation when you face the same color
None, I'm sayin' what the fuck you niggas stand for?
Guess it's lost in the South, Jim Crow
Still I'm shootin' in the gym
Thinkin' back, shit I couldn't hit the rim
Nigga you should see my game now
If it's a fully, nigga aim down
Let the gun work
Super clean but I've done dirt
Talked the shit until my tongue hurt
And I don't run from skirmishes, nigga

[Hook: Glasses Malone]
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself what I'm scared of
How dare the media portray me this way, I can hear the
Crowd screaming, the weirdest of chants, they all in my ear-a
Artist of era, role model, I can't
It's like I'm a parrot, apparently I'm markin' the dance
I seen done with the devil, such a ghetto romance
How many niggas fall victim, looking at you trapped in the system
Mentally they kept you in prison, and you won't get out, no one visit
Open up your mouth, no one listen, you in denial, nigga
I'm in denial with you, I dial dead homies numbers off this liquor
Time and time again I find myself inside the cerebellum
Of several felons, Orion's belt couldn't live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked, I'm next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us before I refer
The madness, my neighbors witness ski masks
The masses don't know
I'm packin' this four and harassin' your ho
Antagonizin' the business you love the most
See the difference to my approach is a forty ounce at the store
If a forty bounce, to get low
I never learn, I'm hard-headed
The corporate world don't like it, but I said it

[Hook: Glasses Malone]
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
I'm a mothafuckin' thug
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around[Intro: 2Pac]

Run that shit, take your shit, that's what I won't do
Out here doin' what I want to
Nigga you do what you can
That's the difference, I'm a mothafuckin' man
I'm a man, nigga, and as a man I don't take dick
I don't do Versace, that's that gay shit
Yeah I said it, I'm a thug
I'm a thug, nigga, guess I need a mothafuckin' hug
Well dig my mama up and tell her give me one
Lot of niggas say they're real, I'm the realest one
I'm the realest, this exactly how I'm feelin', bruh
Ain't no chillin', bruh

[Hook: Glasses Malone]
I'm a motherfuckin' thug
I'm a motherfuckin' thug
I'm a motherfuckin' thug
I'm a motherfuckin' thug
I'm a motherfuckin' thug
[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I'm a thug, the conditions I'm living
It's got me condition for prison, the condition for killing
The condition that we put kids in, often poverty stricken
And even they're education becomes a pipeline to prison
Simply a tool used for mass incarceration
Call it the new plantation, call it new era slavery
Call the court system racist, call it just what it is
A plot and plan for paper that punish the poorest kids
O'Reilly, Hannity, Limbaugh, Geraldo know what it is
But they be on that fuck boy shit, blaming your kids
Don Lemon too, Wolf Blitzer three
I often wish I can have a sit down with every C and every B
And help them see we not enemies
And that includes fraternities with their college degree
I'm part drug kingpin mixed with Booker T
I'm whatever Blacks need me to be

[Hook: Glasses Malone]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself what I'm scared of
How dare the media portray me this way, I can hear the
Crowd screaming, the weirdest of chants, they all in my ear-a
All that's an error, role model I can't
It's like I'm a parrot, apparently I'm marking the dance
I've seen done with the devil, such a ghetto romance
How many niggas fall victim, looking at you trapped in the system
Mentally they kept you in prison, and you won't get out, no one visit
Open up your mouth no one listen, you in denial, nigga
I'm in denial with you, I dial dead homies numbers off this liquor
Time and time again I find myself inside the cerebellum
Of several felons, Orion's belt couldn't live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked, I'm next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us before I refer
The madness, my neighbors witness ski masks
The masses don't know I'm packing this four and harassing your ho
Antagonizing the business you love the most
See the difference to my approach is a 40 ounce at the store
If a forty bounce to get low, I never learn, I'm hard-headed
The corporate world don't like it, but I said it
[Hook: Glasses Malone]

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around[Verse 1]
Rollin’ in a broken Mitsubishi with no AC
And a couple stolen TV’s and a seatbelt for my safety
Play the passenger, I think it’s five years after eighty-
Seven, do that math, 92, don’t you be lazy
I’m looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stopped for a second
Then it rekindled like the flame from a trick candle
Everybody got dental insurance, ‘cause we bout to floss
You get the couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar, but should not today
Them Dayton spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello, my Mr. Myiagi, I want them Kenwood Woofers
Say that you got me
If not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bullseye like a Taurus is
Murder was the melody, you should know what the chorus is
You really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?
He said “Lil nigga, today the poor is rich”
Don't tell your mom that you seen a molotov bomb
And if she asks, just know that you have to lie
And son, don’t forget:
You from Compton
[Verse 2]
Brace yourself, I take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I’m slinging brick and moving cane
Cul de sac and plenty Cognac in major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that’s weighing on your brain
It was me, O-Boog and Yaya
Lucky, ride down Rosecrans
Ugly, waving yo hand out the window, brace yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans
Euphoria can slow dance
Society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Light skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where (mmm) hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed a nine
Pakistan on every porch, it’s fine
We adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
Sliding door, fuck is up?
Fucking shooting forth, if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk
Picking up the fucking pump
Picking off you suckers, suck a dick
Die a sucker punch, a ball of bullets coming from
AK’s, AR’s, Aye y’all; duck
That’s what Mama said when we was eatin’ that free lunch
Aw man, god damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in ‘94, fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
And no peace treaties just peace and BG’s appearing to prove
Bodies on top of bodies, IV’s on top of IV’s
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolly, your color’s correct
Make sure each corporate knows they’ll be calling your mother collect
Now, what you expect?
My life is a threat
Good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Life or death, is you with me?
[Outro]
Tim Westwood, what's up[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I been feelin' kinda cooped up, cooped up
I’m tryna get some fresh air
Hey, why you got the roof off, roof off?
You know it never rains here
Hey, you ain't gotta flash when you takin' your picture
You ain’t gotta draw no extra attention
Paparazzi wanna shoot ya, shoot ya
Niggas dyin' for less out here

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryna throw a bag in a safe

Get up in my rear view mirror

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't be ridin' round and round that open strip

And it’s no good for me, it's so good for them

You probably think a nigga trollin’ (Like)
Or showin' out for the cameras (Right)
Fuck I'm doin' fish-bowlin’? ('Side)
One hunnid thou' on the passenger
Bitch, I'm Kendrick Lamar, respect me from afar
I was made in His image, you call me a god
Everybody in attendance, I'm about to perform
Everybody get offended by the shit I got on
Like, can you buy that, nigga?
Nine hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers
(I need tint) 'Cause bomb head is non-disclosure
(I need tint) So I can live with a peace of mind
Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and not do fines, so fuck a fix-it ticket
You pull me over and might see one of your bitches, ahh!

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
You know I like it presidential (Presidential)
Stretch it out, that's a limo (That's a limo)
Pull it over, let me get behind ya ('Hind ya)
Where we goin', they don't need to know (Don't need to know)
Ghost ridin' in the Phantom (In the Phantom?)
Niggas never see me comin' (Uh, superstar)
She wanna hold me like a ransom (Uh, bitch, I don't know you)
But the money keep me runnin' (Uh, but the money)

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryna throw a bag in a safe
Giggin', tourin', chorin', raisin' babes
Baby Milo wants some Bathing Apes
Niggas crying for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rear view mirror

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints (Windows tinted)

I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip

I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints (Windows tinted)

[Outro: Anderson .Paak & Tayla Parx]
I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can't see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming, no, no
I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can't see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming

[Physical Version Skit: Anderson .Paak & [?]]
(As soon as I put this on, yeah, ooh)
(Yeah, as soon as I put this on)
God damn, what?
(Don't fight it, let it live)
Shit, what's up man?
Bubblin'! I see you my nigga!
Oh, thank you bro!
Ay, bro, I don't know if you- anybody ever told you this, you need to start sellin' bubble baths
Ah
Since you got the song "Bubblin'" so it's- bath bombs dawg! It's London, my nigga! You'll really win!
That's extra, bro. That's extra. You gotta chill, bro, you gotta chill
Whatchu mean I gotta chill, bro? Why are you rollin' yo windows up?
Just be- just be yourself
Bro, lemme get 30 dollars!
Ay, you got some lotion?[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bumping some Sade rolling my window down and hitting the highway
No it's not Friday, but it's my day and sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up thinking that my music don't stick like some nunchucks
Top Dawg and we All Stars like we run Chucks, but nevermind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio is where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game till I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit, haters die young you can run to the pulpit
Pullin off the pit stop, card like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
I don't even trip though I don't need no company
Me, I'm thinking long-term tryin' build a company
Kendrick the Good Kid

[Chorus: JaVonté]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga what I compose be so potent
That if the Earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on the jet ski and start Westcoastin'
I'm not boasting or bragging
Not a person, I'm a dragon
Taking action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came, tell him that I'll be alright
I'm so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key
Oh lady don't call the police
It's just the Average Joe walking with his heart on his appendix
Don't be afraid to speak
So to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
Y'all midget macks swingin' on Shaq now have a seat
You can never co-exist with my mommas oldest
Kendrick be thy name I got my mind right
My nigga locked in the pen that's why my mind write
Ink over my brain, Wha's up?!

[Chorus: JaVonté]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin' off your favorites since I'm cursed
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissing
Fuck you because you don't see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too because she's cute
And the ass look like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
Fuck niggas who can't fight so pull triggers
Fuck the new world gas price that costs a living
Fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching
And whether you fuck with me or not
I don't give a fuck you could keep your props
Fuck keeping it real, I'mma keep it K-Dot
Kendrick everyday, JAY-Z didn't lie
Fucka!

[Chorus: JaVonté]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today

Its hilarious
They make me sick, malaria
All up in my area
Bi*ch i ain't scared of ya
Call me weak all you want
Im still way ahead of ya
I will still be around when your freinds thinkin dead of ya
The day i make it
Swear ill forget it all
If i keep on thinkin about it
Itll prolly make me fall
But i won't let that happen
Swear i will have a ball
And if i keep workin hard
One day ill have it all
And i ain't talkin about cash
Not even talkin bout the cash
Not even the case
And i dont want a bad bi*ch
So get the fu*ck out my face
Im trapped in this place
They won give me no space
I try to inhale and breathe
And i start up a chase
Im gettin close to the gates
I can feel it in my soul
So i gots to rebel
And tell em all that its on
Gettin calls from god
I can here the ringtone
But i miseed tht call
And received a text
Sayin its all for the best
So keep on grindin
And be expecting a test
Oh and one more thing never strive for the less
Competition is feirce
But dont shed no tears
Just work for some years
Itl come to your ears
And it will open your eyes
And show you the prize
And i know that you know that i speak no lies
Just listen to me and you will reach the sky

Verse 2
And tonight
I will say goodbye
To anyone that ever hated
Tryna have a goodtime
I will shine
How could i not
Ill reach the top
With all i got chasin my dream
Like a cop chasen kids with marijuana
Yes i am sober but i can get higher than i stoner
Smoken of my bars i hit it hard
Off my gaurd
Oh my lord
Off the charts
Im a star
Must get far
Workin hard
You think you know it all
Boa sit down
Wit ya dumbass ego
Actin like a dumbass clown
You jus arrogant
Thinkin that you run this town
Talkin shit about rappers to make yourself look better
Thats pathetic
Better yet sympathetic
I feel sorry for you
Boa i wish i was a medic
Cus clearly you are sick
Infected with jealousy
Creating your enemies
With ridiculous tendency
Strong than hennessy
I refuse to be shot down
Without a strong quick burn to the stomach
Shoot me all you want i will feel nothin from it
Tulani boa soul rebel
I will never plummet'gun it
I love it
Keep it 100
Keep it dont shun it
Open dont shut it
I feed off of love hate will only make me vomit
They feed off of hate and im wishen they would stop it



(Beat 1: DJ Premier - JJ Beat)

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yo, Ab-Soul brother number two
What it do, Tony Touch knock beats like I knock boots
Propaganda when I step to the rest of ya
You know they make it bigger then what it is in particular
(Laughs)

(Beat 2: Dr. Dre - The Watcher)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick Lamar the modern day Malcolm
Humble and modest but these margins can move a mountain
I moshpit on the beat and leave the mark of a thousand marksmen
Clearing the street and killing rappers with talent, preach
Yes I said talent, Kendrick ain't scared of y'all, can’t even spell competitor
Lord is my witness
I remember asking artists in streets how they did it
The only features I got is was this handsome face I was getting
How ironic, playing Sonic was the shit like a colonic
Now we vomit over these beats while critics pay homage
This is too street like my 23 summers in Compton
I go so deep, like my dick in your bitch hope the condom never do leak
2 seats, one car, all you hear yes daddy and snapped bras
High salary blow jobs, high calorie rap bars not me
My sweet 16 probably need a school ID
And usually I be, the dominant victor
You know what time it is nigga
Affirmative Action, you fact or you fiction?
I’m a slain cracker from being insane
Pop a vein when I write this shit
I’m think on the shit, I'm vain and I think you’re a bitch
A female poodle under some homo's voodoo, sucking the industry's dick
We catching bodies, fades in the hotel lobby, fuck your security
And that's at the Ritz-Carlton
My impurity's probably your best asset
I spit acid, hit your block and crumble your address
Leaving them stagnant
This is torture when I tort-ya, or escort you
Out the building where ex-convicts with all sorts of
Permeant handshakes, your man can’t stick to the script with handpaint
Popping your lip then popping the clip then popping your van, wait
We keep the piece, but want the peace
Said I was Malcolm to your belief whats up

(Beat 3: Kurupt - I'm Burnt)

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Aww man they let a gangsta in here
Awhuh, Looking for hoes who gon' strip down to there swim wear
Aww, Since I got older n' made an escape from our family
Niggas been causin' casualties for any sucka or super sweater
Say they can handle me huh
I feel assaulted like, fuck around and get charged with battery
Awwhuh, Energized, Blue ball I'm high as wings, we fly to find the things
On fire, I'm carousing, n' kick it like soccer teams, who spit it as precise as him
Awhuh, got a dirt job for that, uhhh, yo, choppa that hoes a beam, (Laughs)

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Everybody focused on this animal
So one who push the envelope, the remedy the antidote
Mix the Henny and the Coke
Sell the tree and the dope, rain sleet and the snow, do we sleep? Hell no
I Pop a tag and pull up in a Elco
Bag a bitch at Elco, run up in her tailbone
Grindin cuz I sell mo, hotter then that hell boy
Fresher than an altoid, see me in them tabloids
Actin like a damn fool, running from them bad boys
Keep a Will Smithon Wessen
Big shell out my weapon, hit you like an astroid, get high wit androids
I'm outta space wit this shit
Pass the L to Elroy. I ain't took a L boy
I ain't never lost nigga. big heat on me blood
Click defrost nigga. Lookin at a boss nigga
Fuck you an yo boss nigga, Iron on me ever see a hunnit play golf nigga

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Get chastised for your raps with mad lies
See mathematically I divide you academy
Multiply the digits, spend it foolishly on women n' Benz's
Jewelry or new Benz's, two or three
Who but me cool as Lupe's CD
Or cooler then the Shade when it's 80 degrees
You wouldn't qualify if you had 80 degrees
There ain't a place or a horse that stay stable as me
You.. (Laughs)

(Beat 4:)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Feeling like a motherfucking animal
Hannibal Lechter of 2012
Elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
If music your calling
Then you balling, pick up yourself
If a nigga said he could see me
Bet he told you in Braille, fucker
Put you on front street, then buy some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldn't bare my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swinging swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan
Watch they face drop when the beat drop
I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool
Me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin
Stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting
No judgement for a plaintiff
They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B
But I've been O.D. since '03
That's March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it's like sweet chin music on Chuck Norris

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Look, Look, Look, Look, Look, Look, I tell em'
I'm just an average black man, gotta take a stand
If I don't I will fall short, gotta have a plan
I don't know my destiny, Lord knows I'm stressed, but he woke me up this morning, it's good to say I'm blessed
In this game we call life, gotta know the ropes
If you don't you get tangled, strangled till you choke
People think they know, think they know what's really best for me
They say that I ain't swaggin' enough, I bought necessities
They sai that I ain't rapping enough, I need some concepts
Man they listening slow, or they too deaf
Shit I got what it takes to be a star
As soon as I'm on man they wanna shut me off
Shining with the sun here they come with there clouds
But I ain't giving up shit I've been runnin' for miles
If you ask around, they say I'm the one in the town
Jay mutha fuckin' rock, knock a shit down
Look, Look, uh, they say life's a gamble
I'm just glad that I'm winning, ya I'm glad that I'm winning
Uhh, They say life's a gamble, huh, but I'm glad that I'm winning
Shit I'm just glad that I'm winning

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
All these niggas can't fuck with anybody in my circle
Squares take a pair to this shit we droppin' right
I'm extra high, I'm extra right
Now I'm freestyling like what the fuck is up, fuck me up
Where the blunt at, can we smoke in here
Say Ab-Soul where's the blunt, can we smoke it here
Got some mo' weed, Hennessy, bitches in here
I'm bout to fuck her, her, n then in the couch right there
You see how we do, right off the top no glasses
Just me n uhh, Kendrick Lamar, we...

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
After non sense, I'm live and direct with a dead compass
On my way to Carson from Compton, steady mobbin
You know my squadrine, Black Hippy
All I need is a pack of Black & Mild's n' an ounce of sticky but I ain't picky
Black lip bastard, black T let's back track
Malcolm X was a government scene, Black causality, Black
That's too deep, and I'm the bomb
That's like C4 on the sea floor
Fuck wit' A.B. n you can see more
Soon as I touch this money, I'm an act of Eeyore
And as soon as Leor put's up a couple mill
I'm a drop a classic album, put up a blunt n' chill, get the deal
It's Ab-Soul actin' an ass, 'bout to cop a number 22 at Jack in the Crack
At the crack of dawn, I know I'm a lab rat, I'm up at the early morn'
Morning the formula to be as big as Madonna with my raps
Call me what you want just don't call me ignorant
I figure since I'm in it I should be the biggest in it
I even grew my hair out out get a little image
And for the record I'm mixed but what ever you wish
Ab-Solo Black lips, black polo, (Laughs)
Uh ohh, blowing dodo in the dojo



[Intro (Ab-Soul)]
Aw, this is four jiggling balls in your mouth all day everyday
Ay you tuned into a fuck what you hear radio where you can stick a dick in your ear and um
(Stick a dick in my ear??) Aw shut the fuck up bitch but anyway
We got this new K Dot record I know you a trap where you at baby

[Verse 1 (K Dot)]
Down Rosecrans
'87 regal sipping on a gold can
Gun tucked like the fetal, position
Top Dawg coalition coexisting with the coldest you ever quoted from California district
Been a coroner like David Banner I'm the owner
Of the marijuana aroma you're smelling hear the donor yelling "it's me bitches"
Who did it, I did it, take 'em where they can't go
Like planet Venus leaning like a mad scientist
Laboratory bottles of empty Heineken telling stories about the ones that came before me
China-man squinting his eyes because I'm blinding him, my shine is
Bigger than a strike of lightning they liking him because I like to win
Never lose, put me on a pedestal
Bet I pedal victories until I pedal off my shoes
Welcome to the lions room, challenge anybody whom
Wanna try they luck they get fucked up and all you heard was (Oohh)
Say hello to the little big homie, and your reality ain't realer than this homie

[Hook (Ab-Soul) (?)]
Now with my hopes in the back
I could ride like this, or like that
Putting all the bullshit aside
K Dot be too funkified
Tell him he's too cool, bitches
Holla "what it do", bitches
What's cracking bounce, skate, rock, roll, hello, world, here we go

[Verse 2 (K Dot)]
They be crackin' like a pack of sunflowers seeds
That the devil tree, put my dick on your double D, double D's
I learnt that from the dog pound, don't get mad at me
I'm just a product of what was happening in the nineties
Plus my uncle used to fuck with your auntie
Tell me 80 percent ho run in your family
Shame on you, shame on your mother, sister, cousin too
You all produced the same tendencies
While I continue to stack plentl cheese
On my expedition to witness my own odyssey
Out of three, of your favorite bet I give them more flavor like seasoning salt
Call me the Darth Vader invading a raw plot like a space crew, stayed at home
All the gangbangers with the police radars like the Marcus rustle but I hustle
Never change up see my muscle, training like I'm constipated bringing in any drama
If you insist, I'm six for six
Get your ass rolled and twisted, like a blunt rap so fall back
Like winter ended
It's like that (like that?)
Like that (like that?)
Like that (like that?)

[Hook]

[Bridge (K Dot)]
C.O.M.P.T.O.N, that's the city that I live in
I got more drank bitch, bring more friends
Bitch bring more friends
I said C.O.M.P.T.O.N, that's the city that I'm repping
I got more dick bitch, bring more friends
Bitch bring more friends

[Outro (Ab-Soul)]
Ahh, callers, callers call up and um, tell me what you think about that new K Dot record
Um who we got on line one
(Hey whats going on man this Jerome man I'm gonna be on Avalon and 135th at the car wash ay ay ay fuck that nigga K Dot man he owe me five dollars straight up)
Man shut your broke ass up, um next caller man who we got on line two
(Um this is Aquaniquashay, yeah Aquaniquashay, this song is tight but tell K Dot
Come get his drawers out the middle of my floor)
Oh shut yo ass up girl that nigga don't even wear drawers
Nah for real I'm just fuckin' with y'all next caller
(Yeah man that song harder than a motherfucker dog on the real ya'll need a run that back)
Ay Jay Rock nigga is that you?
(No, no blood it ain't me, honest it ain't me B)
Aw man I gotta, but anyway man, you Top Dawg niggas crazier than a motherfucker
Ay, who we got on line four?

[Hook]
Now with my hopes in the back
I could ride like this, or like that
Putting all the bullshit aside
K Dot be too funkified
Tell him he's too cool, bitches
Holla "what it do", bitches
What's cracking bounce, skate, rock, roll, hello, world, here we go

[Verse 1: Lil Louie]
I love green
When I wake up the sky green
I keep the 40 Glock cocked when I'm ridind
Yeah, I'll be riding, dirty with my nigga Dirty
You want beef?
Hollow tips leave your eyes blurry
My guys carry, all types of guns
I'm on the block gettin' money, blood, man fuck the ones
I don't talk snitch niggas, I don't fuck with them
I let the chopper get at ‘em like blum-blum-blum-blum
Yeah, never trust no bitch, let 'em
Suck the dick, that's it, then split now it's
Back to my gutter tip, 24's on the whip
Montana in the pot, I'm the chef on the shift
Niggas yappin' at they lip, 'til my gat at they lip
Then I make they head spin like they drunk off a fifth
I got a lot of chips, I hustle with a lot of pimps
Knockin' goons, I’m a goon, 'lot of hoes wanna strip

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
New coupe, top disappear like FUBU
I'm in the hood, pockets heavy like Bruce Bruce
Damn, I'm like a bullet when I shoot through
I'm the shit, these whack rappers is boo-boo
We hit the club, pop bottles like it's nothing
Top Dolla, Pop Hollows out the Impala
Pay dues, spray tools, nigga we wylin'
Money, Power, Respect, mothafucka we dialin'
Top Dawg money gang, get affiliated
.38 special flow, niggas can't trace it (Damn)
I'm still dope dealin', picture that
Cookin' the crack is fine, what I cook on the track
Rippin' it fast, fiends run it back, get it stacked
Blow it fast, get it back, at the mall, pop tags
Hit the lot, buy a 'Lac ride out
Top Dawg E-N-T, niggas know what we about, we get money
[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul chillin', Ab-Soul chillin'
Back for the first time, finna bomb yo buildin'
Who put a bomb in the buildin'? What, a bomb in the buildin'?
That's just rhymes about bombs, I could do rhymes about children
Kids gettin' fucked, pedophile with the style
Young Mike Jack, yeah I'm somethin' like that
Bad to the bone, press your luck like a button
And I'm comin' like the KGB
But I ain't Russian!
I'm takin' my time with it, Patrón with the lime in it
Got a nigga buzzin' like a bug in the club
I'm Usher Raymond, please show me love in the club, I'm sayin'
I need it like a stripper need a tip
Or a catcher need a mitt, or a sneaker need a grip
A gymnast need a flip, or super head need lifts
Soul-o, yeah I'm comin' straight for the top
Been spendin' it like a Jew, Happy Hannukah to you

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
(Hey you) Huh? Oh shit, can I kick it?
Dragon breathe fire when I spits it
Santa Claus raps got me gifted, lifted
Runnin' at the mouth, get it shifted
Blistered, thought it was a dream so I pinched it
Rap got me hooked, so I fished it
Only 6 bars and I sensed it
Rise from defeat, never ran from the beef
Ball hard in the street, Mad Cow with my teeth
Money over bitches, friends over bitches
Hoes over bitches, Benz over switches
Top 5 alive, and you niggas ain't listed
Hip hop is dead and you know the boy fixed it
Straight locksmithed it
Open up the doors for the young nigga sellin' crack
On the side of stores just to keep the body breathin'
Never wanna be a heathen
Been puttin' in the hours
Shouda blown with the towers
I'm real talk
[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
And a nigga was built with a steel heart
K. Dot on the beat, everybody said they smell fart
Shit on anybody, I'm a rappin' porta potty
And I probaby gotta dump right now
See my hobby is to murder every rapper on the planet
Make 'em leave the studio in ambulances
With a bandage on their cranium
I'm bangin' them on sight, with the bars of titanium
Brass knuckles, I beat niggas down, who wanna scuffle?
I’m rude like sayin' ‘fuck you’ to your mother for no reason, now that's cold thinkin'
What am I drinkin'?
I do, spiteful shit, shit like fuck your bitch
Record it, then mail it to your residence
Say hello to the unforgiving flow, cold with it
Grab a coke we gon' be here for a minute
I tell every rapper fall back when I see 'em
Or get clapped like a bitch with gonorrhea

[Verse 1: K-Dot]
Tonight's the night I jump on my shh... uh huh?
Lyrical mayhem, rappers get laid down when I kick
[?] K rounds, a transformer how I break down
Nouns and verbs, you just stumble over your words
So in love with my shit they save it in pampers
The only pull ups be the drive by when I pull up then pull out
Whatever you did shout I put up
Then take the residuals after leaving your body in critical

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Fuck 'em all though, more drive than a car show
Four five in the console, call me Soul Eastwood
Lyrical gun slanging’ and a corral full of wild niggas
PC shut down niggas, it's P.E. I run around niggas
You shawn pope you just sound bigger
You bad boys bite the brick like snitches bite bullets
No diss to Diddy, that's just how I like to put it

[Verse 3: K-Dot]
Living’ life crooked like a neck muscle after you pull it
187, look at the footage
Like O-Dawg, and oh you Oh Dog, you either pay up
Or have your daughter makin’ that ransom phone call
Player, I don’t tolerate niggas who fabricate stories
Who says you did what (what?)
I’m sounding like Noreaga for the paper
One leg to erase ya, kinda ironic

[Verse 4: BO]
Calling the shots like Chick Hearn in intern
Your chick hair fall in my crotch, follow me pop
Spit champagne, they should bottle me up
We on the edge like when my barber be lining me up
Never pledge allegiance, my mom must've done bred a demon
My pop must've done shot bullets instead a semen
I led a legion of doom cramped up in the womb
And started teething the day I heard a beat, let's eat

[Hook]
Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
And it's 187 on a muthafuckin' beat
Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
And it's 187 on a muthafuckin' beat
Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
And it's 187 on a muthafuckin' beat

[Verse 5: Jay Rock]
Yeah, Jay Rock, Watts ambassador
Big truck, paint color Almond Joy
Black choppers seem like the commodores
Get money, fuck bitches, do it like a chore
That's the routine, 24 hours
More money, more power, fuck problems
Pop my collar, hit clubs and pop bottles
For the dollars I’m Master P, 'Bout It, 'Bout It

[Verse 6: BO]
Take a look at my wrist
Now look at my [?]
It feels like I have a fuckin’ jukebox on
You niggas ain’t hot, you niggas lukewarm
And I had swag ever since I was born
And every car I drive, yes it must be foreign
So when I ride by your bitch yelling popcorn
I get up under your skin, yes I’m a fuckin' thorn
And they have a stash spot and you just been warned, bitch

[Verse 7: Jay Rock]
Game said it first, I’m the next out the west
Want a test? Knock your spirit up out your flesh
Who’s the best rapper, I’m his favorite rapper
Too Fresh like a nigga still in the wrapper
I’m the shit like a nigga still in a pamper
Hit a booth, kill a track then we light candles
187 everytime I spit a scripture
Jay Rock, Watt City, I’m the perfect picture

[Verse 8: Ab-Soul]
You ain’t gotta worry about who’s hotter
I been poppin’ collars
Been making it rain in the club, I been about my dollars
I can’t seen colors, I’m colorblind
So when you hit me up, all you gon' see is fuckin' dollar signs
Got my motivation, my nigga stay on the grind
Even if it's back on the block pushing nickels and dimes
Addicted to crime, I fuck with known felons
Top Dawg E-N-T, that's what they yelling, nigga (easy)



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
You know once upon a time, not long ago
There was a caterpillar that lived life slow
And a couple inches he stood
And he said to the butterfly, "What's good?"
And the butterfly told him one day he gon' make him rich
And then they said something else
I don't remember what they said
But I think it was something like the lines of:

Wesley's Theory:
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary thing for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat old monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game and a bad thing chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass them all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the Pres with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check hold on

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]
We should've never gave
We should've never gave brothers
Money go back home, money go back home
We should've never gave
We should've never gave brothers, money go back home, money go back home

Momma:
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
This feeling is unmatched
This feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
We don't share the same synonym, fall back
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribbling scratching diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar (Anna Wise)]
(K.Dot!) Oh, what's going on?
(Something's on my mind) I think something on my mind, too
(I think it's about that time) I think it's about that time
(Put a little pimping in my pocket) Hit me!

King Kunta:
[Intro 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a bone to pick, uh
I don't want you monkey-mouth... sitting in my throne again
(Hold up)
I'm mad (he mad!), but I ain't stressing, noo
True friends, one question

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me, where you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & (Anna Wise)]
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be, be, be, be, be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rappin', wait!
But a rapper with a ghost writer, tell me what happened to you?
(Oh no!)
No, I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell (A two man cell?)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a dumb, dumb baller

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me, where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game got the whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar (Anna Wise)]
When you got the yams... (What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor, R.I.P.
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires, hol' up
24/7, 365 days times two, I was contemplating getting on stage
Go back to the hood, see my enemy and say

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me, where were you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where were you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams... (What's the yams?)

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
(You goat-mouth, mammy f-)
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Body suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
Shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Flag in my city, everybody's screaming "Compton!"
Probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
Put that on my Mama and my baby boo, too
(Twenty million walkin' out the court building, woo woo!)

u:
[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Aahh, aahh, aahh!
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't it, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breaking on marble floors
Watching anonymous strangers, telling me that I'm yours
But you ain't it, I'm convinced your tolerance nothing special
What can I blame you for, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister baking
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
What was your influence, where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I tell you, you damn failure — you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you — I don't need you!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, buck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is -mplicated
Loving you is compli-, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you, not loving you, one hundred proof

[Bridge]
(I can feel your body recognize that you're ashamed of me)
You're afraid of me
(Yes I hate you too)
Yes I

[Outro]
When you look in my eyes
Tell me there's more inside
Tell me you're feeling high
Tell me you're here tonight
Tell me you hear my pain
Hear my soul, how you feeling?
Now you know
If you see it, if you would, God
Now get the gold, yeah!
Wooh!



[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
South Central, home of the warzone where the great thugs roam
Where we ain't promised nothing but shell-bullet wounds and tombstones
Every man for himself in this concrete jungle, jungle
Only the strong survive and the weak perish and crumble
Yeah, niggas' pockets hurting, work day and night in them drug spots
In the kitchen with them razors where the water boiling hot
Blood plus crip plus wrong sign equals a shoot-out
Then the Glock's pop then the block's smoking like a motherfucking Luau
In the projects, watched a lot of niggas, seen a lot of niggas moved out
Then mom said ''back dreaming of big ass, new house''
Then it's back to reality, smokers out back getting so high
Watching niggas kill for a salary, watched a lot of great niggas die
Code of the streets, never ever talk to the motherfucking police
If you do better have a bullet-proof vest, better guard your mouth piece
Yeah, I don't really care about what a nigga may say about me
I'mma let you speak dollars into my pockets, watch them increase

[Hook: Jay Rock & Kendrick Lamar]
Look at you - came from ground zero to the top
Made something from nothing on that project block
Switch your hustle, no more working that dope spot
Middle finger to cops, tell 'em that we're legal now
Yes, we legal now, do it for our people now
Finally we eating now, make sure our belly's stay full

[Interlude: Jay Rock]
We made nothing out of something, man
You know, all the way to the top

Make sure our belly's stay full
Make sure our belly's stay full

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Yeah, I got some, but I'm still on the block like a nigga never left
Still on the grind all the time, gotta get mine doing what's best
Yeah, I came up, but I never changed up on my niggas, no sir
Let bygones be bygones, let it burn like Usher
No chauffeur, I'm wheeling myself in a big '64
Rims poking, three wheel motion, my lungs full of that herb
My niggas still on the curb posted up like junkies at a liquor store
For all my niggas that died in the war, yeah dawg, let the liquor pour
Just Ciroc's, baby, hood shit is all I know
Live life to the fullest, never know when a nigga gotta go
That's how it is out here, dawg, really can't show no feel
I've never seen a man cry 'til a man dies, then you see them tears
Rest in peace, Nini, your grandson still looking handsome
Still gotta keep canons cause them haters out there still can't stand us
You said I got power, all I gotta do is grab hold to my pen
Yeah, I love you to my last breath, grandma, 'til we meet again

[Hook]

[Interlude: Jay Rock]
We're like a train with no breaks
Who gon' stop us?

Make sure our belly's stay full
Make sure our belly's stay full

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yo, Rock - let me get it, let me breathe on it for a minute
Speak for a minute, put my 2 cent in it for a second
Let them get a view of my mind, backpack tucked with a nine
Went to school with it, didn't play with it
Didn't tell nobody it was mine
It was my weapon, had it for protection
I didn't blink, not for a second
Didn't pour my heart and soul to a reverend
They're hypocrite anyway, rather put my full faith in God
Had to stay on my grind something like when I was sumping
Had to maintain my function back against the wall, they fronting
Played the background like a movie extra
Extra activities, no remedy for the crime going on, same old song
Bet ya couldn't make it out here if you wasn't wasn't that strong
Not mentally, but physically, had to get my psychology on
Mama said I gotta come home, but I didn't, stayed out real late
My excuse was ''how we gon' eat if it's no food on the plate?''
Now wait - think back, yeah yeah nigga, far far back
Came from the bottom to the tip top, now tell me how you love that?

[Hook]

[Verse]
Let your fears go and catch your blessings, yeah
Let them hoes know you don't do messy, yeah
Screensaver on because they dry snitch
Caption on your post saying "You my bitch"
Tell me that you're leery
Tell me you gon' get in trouble
You don't want the city
You don't want 'em all to judge you
Ex-man said he caught a fair case
Young bull slid in for the Segway

[Chorus]
I touch down, smokin' dope on the daily
Come here lil' baby, know you're birthday ready
I'll turn you out if you want, if you let me
Don't save face, don't save face
Your friends go, yeah, your friends throw salt on you
Your friends go, they gon' hate and say what not to do
But friends go, if it's you then who you lyin' to?
Don't save face, don't save face

[Post-Chorus]
I want you here, then what's your heart gon' say?
I want you here, baby, don't walk away
You know for real, I would go out my way
When we gon' slide?
I wanna build wit' you, I wanna vibe
Sleepin' on explosives, everything live
I'ma get you open, one day at a time
Put that on God, man, I put that on God
Won't you meet me out?
[Chorus]
I touch down, smokin' dope on the daily
Come here lil' baby, know you're birthday ready
I'll turn you out if you want, if you let me
Don't save face, don't save face
Your friends go, yeah, your friends throw salt on you
Your friends go, they gon' hate and say what not to do
But friends go, if it's you then who you lyin' to?
Don't save face, don't save face

[Post-Chorus]
I want you here, then what's your heart gon' say?
I want you here, baby, don't walk away
You know for real, I would go out my way
When we gon' slide?
I wanna build wit' you, I wanna vibe
Sleepin' on explosives, everything live
I'ma get you open, one day at a time
Put that on God, man, I put that on God[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Once again it's on
I'm the youngest in charge, I am not playin'
I fear no man else than God
Scatter your features, give you a face collage
Not one, but two, I face menage
No hands involved, mommy would rather give a mouth massage
General, you can call me the sargeant
$7.45, five percent tip
I know I'm the shit, please hold the applaud
I spent summers writin' rhymes, winters freestylin'
Daydreamin' Gilligan thoughts on an island
I didn't develop, I was born with this talent
Brain swell up, whenever you come to me you were the challenge
I need a way to balance street shit from the rap shit
Stay on my toes, feet grounded to the souls of the dead
But still bulletholes surrounded the arc in my feet to the crown on my head
Preach, listen how I pledge
I've been gettin' this money since you dummies were peein' in bed
To poppin' wheelies on handlebars and pegs
To poppin' Big Willy at the bar with bread
Pause, it's real talk, I know you gotta crawl before you walk
Shit, I decided to jog
I'm ten brains better than y'all
Propane make emergency calls, whenever them boys speak
I fold niggas up, make both of the ends meet
You 'bout to fitness a lyrical fitness
This is what it'd sound like if God spoke over beats
I cash in my rap friends
Peep the way I deliver, make you wanna tell your peeps
I consider that they learn from me
This is volcano hot, fuck a third degree
Burn, You gotta be K-D-O-T
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Once again it's on, I am through with niggas
Twin Glocks, it'll shoot niggas
Put you next to a plant, under a root nigga
Hands folded together up in a suit nigga
This what we do nigga, run your mouth, we remote control mute niggas
Matter of fact, I recruit niggas

[Verse 3: Bill Thrill]
Bill Thrill straight spook niggas
Sixteens that'll ruin niggas
You mad cause I'm gettin' figures
I'm the bigger picture, you losin' dough and mine's gettin' thicker
I got somethin' that'll sting yah I call it the pinch hitter
Gather your mans so they can die with yah
Bill and K-Dot, now y'all dealin' with the best (right)
Side by side, yeah we somethin' like breasts
Flow game killin', I spit bars of death
Now they yellin' could it get any worse
[?] definition of Hell on Earth
Keep somethin' on the side, yeah you know that work
One false move, it'll make your whole body jerk
Think before you cross this turf
You'll get turned into ashes, or even laid in the dirt[Hook]
Everybody wanna play that tough guy
'Til them things come out and them shots fly
Say your last words homie and it's bye bye
You shouldn't have been playin' with me
Everybody wanna play that tough guy
'Til them things come out and them shots fly
Say your last words homie and it's bye bye
You shouldn't have been playin' with me

[Verse 1]
I ain't no killer but don't push me
Them very words said can resurrect Pac straight from the dead
And it takes a young nigga like me to push the limit
No gimmick, this is real homie
I wake out of my sleep, sweat drippin' off my face and cheek
I swear to God, death callin' for me
That's why I carry a heat, roamin' these streets 'til they come and get me
Cause ninety percent of them are comin' with me
C4 your car doors and watch your shit blow in a jiffy
Quick, boom, explode when I empty
I'm on the edge so please don't tempt me to jump
I walk around with a pump, just to scatter you punk's heads
Then go and get some head by that woman you want
She does what I says, I says what I does
Crazy back then, yeah that's what I was
But now I'm psycho, mental nigga, holdin' a grudge
I put a hole in your mug, and let the blood leak out
Until it fill up a tub, then put your son in it
This is no image, this is ether
Cocaine, reefer, alcohol mixed with it
They tried to label your boy as a menace
Put me in some records, along with Guinness
I just started, I ain't finished
Chest to your head, until all you motherfuckers diminish
[Bridge]
I hope y'all ready to ride
Cause it's do or die
If not, stay inside
I hope you ready
If not, be quiet
Cause when shots fly
Somebody will cry
I hope you ready
I hope y'all ready to ride
Cause it's do or die
If not, stay inside
I hope you ready
If not, be quiet
Cause when shots fly
Somebody will cry
I hope you ready

[Hook]
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me

[Verse 1]
My gun got many ways to get you
You get hit with a missile and live, you would need barbed wire to stitch you
This is not fictional, this here is typical
I will bring it to your door if you can't see the visual
Black Manson, won't you ask him
How I have sex with the trigger just to make the barrel orgasm
Remember when it started, nobody protected me
Had to make way for school in the mornin' and niggas sweatin' me
Where you from? Like shit, I'm tired of niggas questionin' me
Now I'm in, I gotta have that thing next to me
Went to my pop's closet
The next day I'm pullin' up my pants, grabbin' my crotch and walkin' awkward
Somethin' pop off, then I have somethin' to spark with
By the bus stop like man I wish somebody'd push me
I'mma let the hawk spit, with a killin' instinct
Like some of these students gonna have an early coffin

[Hook]
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me

[Verse 2]
Now I got a love Jones for that [?] still on
Michael Jackson niggas, the fifth'll change your skin tone
Sniper guns'll chirp [?]
They'll prolly chirp silent when your Nextel is off speakerphone
How real is that? Never
Now niggas do dirt in daylight cause the [?] is clever
I resign to the fact, that any [?] where the drama is at
I'm reclinin' [?]
Keep your wordplay intact
And 50 couldn't say it better
Can't find you, show me where his mama live at
You a gangsta, I'm not one, but it doesn't mean
By all means, I'm not very able to pump a shotgun
[?] and watch as you [?]
With the MAC or the Ruger, nigga I got options
So while you play possum, I sit and watch 'em
Creepin', Nas got his so you fucked if you don't got one

[Hook]
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard meYou can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me

[Bridge]
I don't know about you, but see, baby I'm ruthless
Try to fight me, and see, baby you're useless
Shots from the MAC do more than have you toothless
The sound is exclusive, bang bang bang, boom

[Verse 3]
I explode like a Vietnam bomb
Hotter than firemans but my hand got a firearm
Fire at your arm, titty, and hands, breakin' your palms
Usin' them to snatch purses the brand of Louis Vuitton
Nigga, what type of shit you on? It's simple mass destruction
Revengeance, tension, you see I've had enough
Did I mention? I sniff you pussy niggas out
The smell that you bring has aroma like an incensce
Play matrix, see if you the one
It's a million ways to die and this here is number one
And that's starin' down a barrel of a gun
After I smack you 'til it's gun powder on your tongue
Cause boy them shells get hotter than the sun
And boy when I spit, please be prepared to run
Boy, don't forget to have a vest when I come
Cause I'll hit your chest and clog up your lungs mothafucka

[Hook]
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard meYou can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me

[Radio Interlude]
...and this is WTOP Radio and I'm your host DJ Turn-Up
I don't turn down nuttin' but my collar
I ain't turnin' down no money
And I ain't turnin' down no mothafuckin' fade
Now bitch if you're pushin' up the street with your orangutan-lookin' ass, take some advice and bang SZA ya flat-foot bitch

[Intro: SZA]
Itchin' for a climax lasting past 11:30
Do you got it like that, do you really got it like that?
Itchin' for a purpose, I can't seem to scratch the surface
I ain't got it like that, do I really got it like that?
You keep talkin' 'bout time, I got none
You can find me where
The sun don't never end and the waves don't part
You don't pay enough of my rent, don't start
I got big dreams and you got quick scheme to get rich quickly
And I don't wanna waste another hour
Really need to take another shower
Dirty for you

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Big business, big booty bitches, black on black Benz's
Backing out the back to back my engine, backpack with gats in it
Backflip my dollars and bend Impalas, my arm whistling
Palm flipping, middle finger, fuck y'all, I let it linger
Plush wall and marble floor, ghetto Commodore singing
Tours for my whores swinging, on my heart swore
I pour plenty more semen, or explore cunnilingus
Dummy tore through that boy for pointing fingers
Honey you're a PS4, my game change seasons
And my name explain visas, I defame your name easy
We aim and keep squeezing, bitch my lane say no treason
My chains say no cubic, all y'all look stupid (stupid!)
Big dog, three phone call log stupid (stupid!)
I'm Chris Paul, West Coast, All-Star stupid!
The mantra, the holy trinity, baby your sponsor
My concert and your facility, via del Compton
And Watt's finest!
[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Now this that big shell fishscale
BMX on the ramp with the fishtail
Pegs on the front, we gon' get there
We four deep at a swap meet, don't need a 5th wheel
This bitch steal whoever if situations get real
This that fresh out the bounty, bustin' knuckles
Get buckled if you ever try to knock the hustle
Show your hands, watch how I shuffle (No cuts)
And show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus
Rollin' up that boondock, some call it moon rock
Gotta keep that bass in my step, dope in a tube sock
Gotta do what I do to remain on
So all a nigga need is good love when I come home
Cause the baby's gotta eat, baby the rent's been due lately
And I just caught a hot one, I ain't tryna go too crazy
Fugazi, not me, me and my niggas not sweet
Give you thug passion, how you walkin' around knock-kneed
I'm the silver bullet movin' at top speed
Show you how to get it and get away with it scott-free!

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Baby, I wanna, I wanna get you to understand
I love you, and I love her too
But that may be too much for you to deal with
So I wrote a song about it, you wanna hear?
Well, here we go

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My life is Mardi Gras
And she's the life of the party, y'all
It's like ring around her rosy
When I came around they chose me
And I make 'em feel famous, famous, famous, famous
Winner circle, square don't fit
And I'm caught up in a triangleship
Living life in a triangleship
And I'm caught up in a triangleship
Living life in a triangleship
And I'm caught up in a triangleship

[Verse 1: Terrace Martin]
Yup, I'm caught up in the middle of this love thing
I keep trying to escape the ball and chain
My main dame holds me down for the winter season
My side piece just a winner, that's for many reasons
Insecurities inside of myself
Have me not be able to picture you with nobody else
I'm caught up between two beautiful women
Who both could clean and play their position - it's like
I know I'm wrong, but I can't seem to get it right
Process of elimination, hell of a decision to make
Take two and add me
Never knew a real commitment would ever involve three
The one she got a temper, always make sure I'm fair
The other one she leaves me lonely cause she's focused on the bread
Yeah, can a man ever be so lucky?
I guess that's why these women don't trust me
A 3ChordFold

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]
It's hard being the star of a plot when
Love and lust at the same time got them
So I doubled up, put five on, they got ten
Gambled with their hearts, had the ball and I dropped it
To leave would be the death of me, dearly departed
Don't know how I got by being partially honest
A thin line between love and hate
Yeah, I crossed it, wait
Love is no guarantee, I got options
Fate, it's me and her, it's me and she
Multiple choices, not A and B
A test I was destined to fail for sure, boy
Rather be stingy than to see you hugging on old boys
Oh boy, I'm just a man with a lot of love to give
And hope you understand it was never my intent
To mislead neither of you, but it is what it is
Cupid tried to aim straight, but I guess cupid missed
3ChordFold

[Hook]

[Outro]
Deep in his love
Not sure if that's what this still is
We used to get away, and love, play
Innocent as kids then
Something else happened
We wanted different things
Days turned to nightmares
And over time things changed
Life is funny that way
Time is money, and my bank statement states that I'm in need of more than
Fuss and fights and making up
And waking up after watching me sleep
Just singing songs about moving on
Cause trust ain't slept here in weeks
So let's leave
We talk about 'til color fades from the leaves and falls again
And winter wind springing up in the same thing
Still here
Summer crystal blue sky clear
We just living on love
From hearts trenched and trembling in fear
Chord one, the free loader

I was 8 yrs old when I first saw you. I couldn’t describe how I felt at that moment. So many emotions. Full of excitement. Full of joy and eagerness. 20 yrs later I understand exactly what that feeling was
INSPIRED

The people that you touched on that small intersection changed lives forever. I told myself I wanted to be a voice for man one day. Whoever knew I was speaking out loud for u to listen

Thank you

"Boarding completed I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally"

[Verse 1]
Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson

[Hook]
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause I'm a trip
[Verse 2]
Landing on another runway, fly with me
Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama)
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga
Curtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge

[Hook]
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this

Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause I'm a trip
[Verse 3]
Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
On some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing

[Hook]
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this

Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now

It's work on the phone
Tell my mama that I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers
I said it's work on the phone
Somebody tell my mama I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
If that's your real nigga, he gon' slide for you
If that's your real nigga, he gon' die for you
You ain't gotta question when it's brackin'
Just point me in the direction when it's action
Day ones in the sandbox, from breakin' through them padlocks
To burners in the stashbox, your whole hood mascots
My whole hood mad Watts, that's gang, gang, gang
We politic, on missions, don't hang, hang, hang
We got bad bitches too, huh, and they blast bitches too, huh
And they shoot the fair one too, huh, we can take it there too, huh
Niggas win some and lose some, just went half on a new drum
Summertime is overdue huh, double back when the news come

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
It's work on the phone
Tell my mama that I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers
I said it's work on the phone
Somebody tell my mama I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers

[Verse 2: Jay Rock & Kendrick Lamar]
Back door, back door, East Side, we go back door
What you wanna act for? You get what you ask for
Ballin' in the game now, East Side, we go back door
(East Side, East Side, East Side, East Side, East Side)
Nothing is the same now, motherfuck the task force
Came up and I went back, changed up, never did that
If it's taped off, yeah I did that, blew a half a mil', yeah, I did that
On the blade, girl, is you with that? Ten toes on the pavement
Sell your soul in the Days Inn, shacked up like a caveman
Troopers on deck, secure the bag, we plant the flags
So what we on next? What we on next?
Rock bottom from the NG's, handguns on the ten speed
RIP to my dead homies, loyalty is all we need, yeah

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
It's work on the phone
Tell my mama that I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers
I said it's work on the phone
Somebody tell my mama I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Do you really want a test?
You better study real hard before you end up with an F
Be my guest, soul's what every soul wants to be I guess
I'm with the B-I pardon me I be a phenom
Heard you was a fag in L.A. like FILA
Whatever happened to the U-N-I-T-Y?
Like Queen Latifa
See you steam as a little teapot (how so?)
Short but not too stout (uh)
Your clout fabricate what you 'bout (huh)
I'm bout done fuckin' wit' you small time MC's
Nigga I'm competin' wit' Pun
Run up and get done up like a prom hair-do
Top floor still on the come up, where are you?
It's one million ways to die I'm livin' proof
Matter fact let me rephrase that (Try me)

[Chorus: Sample]
"Action speaks louder than words"
"Actions—" "Action speaks louder than words"
"Action speaks louder than words"
"Actions—" "Action speaks louder than words"

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Committed to my cash, loyal to my projects
But AR knock off a nigga biceps
I'm a go getter, I'm a gorilla
Nigga I'm the shit, shit on shitters I'm realer
I'm so exquisite, bitches they love to visit
Fuck'em and send them home with their fucking thongs missing
I'm what the game missing that why them rappers hatin'
Next nigga who try me I'ma leave his head vacant (blah)
Goon to the death, thanks to my habitat
See before you speak you better watch who you yappin' at
And if you speak then it's you I'll be clappin' at
One shot, one kill no clappin' back
I'm in the streets, I hear you niggas talkin'
Claimin' they killers and that ain't even in they hearts
They something like ink on a piece of paper, marks
I'm something like a razor blade, sharp
[Chorus: Sample]
"Action speaks louder than words"
"Actions—" "Action speaks louder than words"
"Action speaks louder than words"
"Actions—" "Action speaks louder than words"

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Wanna compete with this tech-a-nique?
Big gun, take a seat
I can blaze for days but me? Rather take a freak
Touch socks in the suite, big name in the streets
Top Dawg ENT, GED, TNT
40 Glock pop shit, bust into the Glock click
Semi-automatic lips spit when the pin itch
Tighter than a closed fist
Product make your nose twitch
All that bold shit have you buried where my dog piss
Tortoise speedin' through the game like Porsches
Fortress, thousand dollar frames on our porches
Cautious, cock it and explode the track
Your brain over wax, it's solved over rap
Shots breathe, got power tell the cops freeze
Countin' all this bread, Aftermath not Eve
Big league I'm the best my spot's earned
You niggas disagree? (try me)
[Chorus: Sample]
"Action speaks louder than words"
"Actions—" "Action speaks louder than words"
"Action speaks louder than words"
"Actions—" "Action speaks louder than words"

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Anybody can get it
Send 'em in a cloud if you think sky's the limit
I'm foul like a elbow intended
In the game no winning even if it is a scrimmage
You can get coached right now
Black Phil Jackson maxin'
Cooler than George Bush when the planes went down
As far as rappin'?
I should be a wordsmith
Porsche GT swerve like cursive (beep beep)
Y'all wait on Wayne to drop C3
I drop C-4, bomb on you (I mean war)
No white flag put 'em in a full body cast
Like a sitcom, make 'em sit calm, I sip Dom P
Bumpin' the Iselys with a bitch on
My wee wee like I been in France too long
Need another level been advanced too long
Niggas want war come on
[Chorus: Sample]
"Action speaks louder than words"
"Actions—" "Action speaks louder than words"
"Action speaks louder than words"
"Actions—" "Action speaks louder than words"

[Verse 5: Punch]
Ugh, this nigga tryin' to meet the architect
You going about this thing the wrong way
That kinda far fetched (kinda far fetched)
What's the reason for this nonsense?
You listen to your boys
You should have reasoned with your conscience (naw)
You wasn't built for this content
I send a chick at you that dabble in bondage
Tie you to the bed post as you respond with kindness
Even let her blindfold you, you love how she dominant
My Spanish chick from Brooklyn, Bed-Stuy
Who specialize in givin' Brazilian Neckties
While I sip a Mai Tai
Cause my time is far more important
Than to be shootin' it out with tough guys
(And I) still flow like faucet water
My niggas half step like foster daughters
My mic can slaughter a nation like the angel of god
You think this lyrical homicide nigga?

[Chorus: Sample]
"Action speaks louder than words"
"Actions—" "Action speaks louder than words"
"Action speaks louder than words"
"Actions—" "Action speaks louder than words"

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, come come now
Soul Brother No. 2, I'm the one now
Sun up to sundown, still kickin' that shit
Put your gun down
I come in peace like a extraterrestrial being
Eat me a meteor and walk across the moon barefeet
But don't nobody rhyme like this no more
Call me the 2010 Rakim
I got soul, there's more in store
Feel like a CVS, open 24
Spent nights tryin' to overshadow my shadow
For niggas tryin' to block my light like a solar eclipse
I bring a knife to a fist fight and when I cut a record
So when I cut the cheese, shit you know what it is
Mr. Absoulutely the most incredible at this
So adjust your bass, your treble and then

[Chorus]
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Finna break this blunt down and burn me up one
Then sip on this Remy 'til it turn me up some
For me it's more difficult to be simple
Than it is to be complex as a lot of apartments
You niggas comedy, I'm laughing at you probably
We are not the same, there's no strand of monotony
Between you and I until we die
Revelations say you either fry or fly
And it's hard to find God when you ain't never seen him
It's pie in the sky and there's bodies on the cement
And I know you lookin' at me like, "You don't speak English"
I bring the heat like a phoenix, a son under Phoenix sun
And I'm rootin' for the Lakers when they play the Phoenix Suns
I ain't really into sports, that's just where I'm from
Long Term Two
And if it's in your possession then follow the directions my dude

[Hook]
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Come come now
Pac told me fuck the world, I'm 'bout to cum now
I've been a pro, but now I'm profound
Propane on posers, restraining from the doja
Imagine if I smoke, I probably come up with a quote
So heavy you'll forget every album you heard from Hova
Or 2pacalypse I'm Hub City's novelist
Come and get your scholarship, I'm taking kids to school
A pool full of spit, dive in, I'm 'bout to drool
You'll drown trynna backstroke on concepts that I wrote
I was a black sheep, but now I'm just a goat
And I'm 'bout to elope, married to the game joe
This is hip hop at its finest, where'd you find this? In a Ziploc
Til the wheels fall off, fuck a pit-stop or what not
Where my tear drop? I murdered it
My pot-holes is turbulence
I'm in the sky wit it
When you listening to Kendrick, just

[Hook]
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
This for my niggas that really rap all night
No sleep, do it with your eyes closed
I can see your vision from Del-Amo
Poppa took the television, but left the radio
Ill niggas, wack niggas, what's the ratio?
Is this shit degrading or inspirational?
I'll have you know I must've wrote about a thousand rhymes, a thousand times
I give you my word

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Cause I just gotta be heard
I just gotta be heard
I just gotta be heard
Said I gotta be, yes sir I gotta be

Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
I'm screaming out peace
But his chopper piece a bad outcome
Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
I'm screaming out peace
But his chopper piece a bad outcome

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm vicious, and my house is a red light district
And my couch is a porno star, out of town from Houston and Memphis
And I never gave a fuck and I never did fuck with y'all so I kept my distance
Just me and my day-ones, and a thousand ones for these strippers
Ho I been on my own, get on the song then pee on the song
My bladder is gone, I shatter your dreams
I'm Freddie it seems
My shadow is wearing expensive cologne
Pigtails and dookie braids, cabinet full of Kool-Aid
I'm ghetto as fuck and my pedal is up
But I'm gassing on all of you niggas man
Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
I'm screaming out peace, but his chopper piece a bad outcome
Stale face, how come?
Is it cause I do me? Or your main bitch wanna do me?
Face shots - we call it Call of Duty
K-Dot now bitch give me two feet
Made my bitch come give me two G's
Raised by wolves and we do eat
Play by rules and you might live
And I try to do this shit for the kids
But y'all got different prerogatives
And y'all rot in hell
And I dwell where the fortune live
And that's vicious

[Chorus: YG Hootie]
Two presidents and we blowing presidential

See my hood shine, pray I live to see the day
Rest in peace to my homie, he got hit up with that ('K...'K...'K...)

[Verse 2: YG Hootie]
Big mouth, settle me down
Tell YG this how you hold a choppa
I ain't gonna lie I be feeling like Obama
Shootin shit wit Dave, mama knock [comin]
This is illusion by the Patron
Chopper cocked and I'mma clap mine
Homies in the pen ain't never coming home
Creamed out car from the Chevron
Me and my mama in the county line
It was food stamps, now it's passport stamps
Bout to come back to the deuce line
Told you we'll blow like deuce nines
BSM - we cannibals
Eat your flesh, no antidote
Kendrick - that's family though
We on Rosecrans, it's a party ho
This right here's that Martin-Malcolm
Only difference we still alive
By any means necessary, squad life we down to ride
Interstate, rival Pi's
Seen them tears on my mama's eyes
Do whatever it takes to keep my daughter fly
I'll do whatever it takes to be immortalized

[Chorus: YG Hootie]
Two presidents and we blowing presidential
Two presidents and we blowing presidential
See my hood shine, pray I live to see the day
Rest in peace to my homie, he got hit up with that ('K...'K...'K...)

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
*Screaming*

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need ya!
The world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear—

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too

[Break: Jessica Vielmas]
(Loving you ain't really complicated)
"Housekeeping, housekeeping"
(What I got to do to get to you?)
"¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!"
(To you)
"¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!"
(Loving you ain't really complicated)
"¡Disculpe!"
(What I got to do to get to you?)
(To you)

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Are you the reason why mom and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed," you ain't try

[Break]
*Sniffling*

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk *gulping*
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world
About that shit you thinkin' and that time you *gulping*, I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk it'd say, "You gotta go"
And if I told your secrets the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Emjae]

I'll admit in the beginning I didn't give a fuck about you
You came and you went, thought I could choose living without you
But now I'm feelin' sick cause your ass ain't around
You cheatin' on me (bitch), with every motherfucker in town
I tried to play it like it's cool, but I feel the repercussion
On top of that your ass is rollin' round with my cousin
I think I passed the breaking point cause I done copped a pound
I hear you streaking through nigga's pockets, I'm layin' 'em down
(Gimme that) And I ain't stoppin' 'till you trapped in the safe
Now my base ain't safe so we could skip three states
Switch place after the break, more moves to make
Cause I'm in love with this trap ass bitch called Kate
This [?] money gon keep me from looking funny
And bummy, let her run me cause she bout it
Monday through Sunday we don't play no games here
You know how we get down, you know all the hoes love me
Money makes the world go round

[Hook]

So I'ma kick in the door
With the Mac 10, or the lone 44
Screaming give me the dough back nigga
Please, don't ask no questions
This a robbery nigga
You already know
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]

Yo pockets kinda thin, shawty wanna go out on a date
Shit I got no chips to spend, but I said it's OK
Cause momma was drivin' the Benz
Her Jimmy Choos had me convinced
I said she was pretty, she love a nigga compliments
I had the thing with me, she didn't know
By the end of the day, she be breakin' off them arguments
I said fuck the ass and titties
I want the jewels and Benjies
I swear a nigga pockets was empty, starving
I whispered to myself, a nigga bout to come up
She like "Oh I beg your pardon"
Oh nothing, I was thinking bout your valet parking
Excuse me, now give me the [?] I know they [?]
I don't wife usually, but today I'll be your man
So we went to the restaurant, I said OK
I think about the getaway shit, over lunch
Like what type of jewels I want, everything
I ain't goin' back to the block 'till her body is clean
Snatch it off her cuticles, takin' off the pinky ring
I know this shit good but it bad as it seems
So hate conversation, little does she know
That nigga like you and me was patiently waiting, give it up
I wanted heartbeat, now thanks for the business
Go home, oh yeah please call me
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]

Yeah, a nigga starving out front of your place
Put the beam to your face, I don't really want the safe
I want everything in your house
From your TVs, couches your dog and your spouse
Everything is valuable, so is you
Cooperate so a nigga won't have to blast you
We all know what this Mac could do
At point blank range, it's a closed casket fool
I'm the Watts bandit, yeah I came up
Put all these goods in a pick-up truck
Rollin' down Central, I spotted me a target
This nigga, he was doin too much flossin'
Yea the truck I parked it
Hop out cock back the heater
Run up in his ass in his beemer
I'm yellin' out, "hand it over, 'fore it's all over"
Put a shell through you and your mother fucking chauffer
He was looking choked up, so he start sweating'
Looking down the barrel of my Wesson
Yeah he's getting robbed, he know he can't stop it
He gave me the keys, and every fucking thing up in his pockets
Started up the Beemer, parked it where my truck was
Young niggas like "what up blood"
I'm like what up blood, this nigga came behind me
Said "hand is over nigga, or that your ass is mine"

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
"Stay strong, keep your faith in God," what I told him
Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
Your brother's getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
Ain't recieved any mail
It's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine

[Chorus: Javonte]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out, 15 years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long
Haven't seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up, he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his Mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life
I can only imagine
That's fucked up
I can only imagine, Uncle Bob

[Chorus: Javonte]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
When blacks pack with minorities
System grab more of these 18 year olds
18 year sentence with no parole
The state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy?
That's what I call it, it's full of shit
A toilet can help quick, the government help?
No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah
It's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
Care? No
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
For 5 grand, with intentions to expand
More prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business
Imagine
We're being used
Imagine
The truth shall be told

[Chorus: Javonte]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Intro: The Argo Singers & J. Cole]
If you miss me
And you can't find
Me nowhere
I done seen it all, oh my God
Uh
I done seen it all, oh my God, I swear
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy

[Verse 2: Lute]
Potato over my gun
I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds
When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford ’til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with
[Verse 3: DaBaby]
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain’t tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out, "Rip," and they missin' you
They got me started, I might as well finish it (Talk your shit)
I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do
Baby
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

[Intro: Bilal]
Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is...
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life no longer infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive"
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
"What have you did for me"
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church

[Outro]
Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch

Pimp-pimp (Hooray)

Pimp-pimp

[Bridge 1]
I'm sick and tired of being tired
Can't pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesize if we live or not
Promise momma not to fear nobody
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

[Verse 1]
Get God on the phone, said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy, where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone, tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home
World is going brazy, where did we go wrong?
It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome
Get God on the phone
I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (Diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossing up (And I'm bossing up)
Bitch, get out the way (Bitch, get out the way)
I'm the only way, we can fornicate
Ah, pimping and posing, look what I drove in, ah
Having these hoes and I know that I'm chosen, ah
I live by the code and me and my bros and, ah
My dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie

[Bridge 2]
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

[Verse 2]
Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
(What's up, my nigga?)

[Verse 3]
Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
Parallel park like an alien came visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello, Billy)
So many plays, homie, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 911
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
Top billin', that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch, I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby
I'm fuckin, I'm crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda
Pistol and poverty, come get to know us
(Get Top on the phone)

[Outro]
Who doing the drums?
Man put that nigga on the drums man
Yep, all day, "Mortal Man" and "Kunta"
Alright, from the top

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said...

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What did the Asian say?) "A peace of mind"
That's what the Asian said—I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said "taking my time"
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What did the Indian say?) "A piece of land"
That's what the Indian said—I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(Now, what the black man say?) "A piece of pussy"
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said "nigga, come back to reality for a week"
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What the white man say?) A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
"Look at what you accomplishing"; what he said to the boy
"I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece"

[Saxophone Interlude: Terrace Martin]

[Hook: Bilal]
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
[Outro]
What the black man say?
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply

[Verse: SZA & Kendrick Lamar]
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
(Tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and...)
And welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you
(What about when you tried to do a side for that but you...)
They tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due
(Talk about the charge you got...)
And preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth, truth
(Do you believe in God? If you don't, it's cool)

[Segno: SZA & Kendrick Lamar]
(But) head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
(Don't tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot...)
Come on give me some help, hey
Head is the answer, do it for the future, girl

[Bridge: Lance Skiiiwalker & SZA]
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
And I just wanna
And I just wanna
Straight up
Eyes with my head
And I can't use some help
Straight up

[Outro: SZA]
Head is the future

[Hook: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And this I know

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk
How come I can make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone
[Hook: Anna Wise]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me

[Verse 2: Punch & Kendrick Lamar]
He drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle
Lit off Henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God and still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I'm passin' lives on the daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleepwalkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade
Wait[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, duality personalities always conflicted me

[Bridge 1: Kendrick Lamar &  CeeLo Green]
Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl
I can explain
I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor
Let me explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you how
I can explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
I'll be there with the answer
Let me explain

[Verse 1: CeeLo Green]
I'm bizarre, avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive, you're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make believe?
Anything you want
I can explain
I can explain it
Any misunderstandings, baby
Let me explain
I can explain it
Why don't you sit and talk to me?
I can explain
Let me explain it, ah yeah
Let me explain
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you are

[Bridge 2: Kendrick Lamar & CeeLo Green]
I can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed his body and soul
I can explain
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
Let me explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the odd
I am yours
I can explain
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours

Look, look

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Verse 1]
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
Wait a minute!
[Chorus]
Now, why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Verse 2]
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
[Chorus]
Why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Verse 3]
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (broke home baby)
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies (broke boy and babies)
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town
[Interlude]
In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker

[Chorus]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Outro]
Pimp pimp (hooray!)[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
You been down with me since I first started
No love for a friend, baby girl cold-hearted
I know it's really hard to believe
But fuck her with the shoe, I probably would never succeed
On my knees, beggin', 'Please' for the Lord to forgive me
I tried to bounce, but your spirit had bit me
I'm drinkin' the Remy, killin' niggas, squeezin' the semi
Ridin' 'round in a Cutlass, shit, I need me a Bentley
I missed bail cause of you, nigga, went to jail cause of you
Trialed niggas in my cell cause of you
I squeeze shells cause of you, I wouldn't tell cause of you
Even probably brought my ticket down to hell cause of you
Damn, look, see, I'm knowin' that I'm 'posed to shake
But anytime I leave you, I'm feelin' my heart ache
Hope you feelin' my vibe, holmes
Nah, not a chick, I mean the shit that you drive, holmes

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when you're around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin'
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Livin' a double life, havin' double shots of Patrón
With my mistress 'stead of my wife, I was on
Like the switch in my Marriott, can we get married, Dot?'
I fucked her three times, then I was gone, apparently not
Story of the 80–20 rule is me
Movin' cautiously, parked in the park with my back seat
Way back, her perfume on my white tee
Ignorin' calls from my wifey
See, I was dead wrong, but was tryin' to get a nut
And she had some great dome
Like the New Orleans Saints when they're playin' at home
What's a nigga to think? Oh, just throw away some pussy
Then my conscious called me, 'Pussy'
You don't understand, mama had ass
And I'm quite a butt man, I love my wife, but, man...
I never thought of the day I would quit
Till I opened the door, seen a nigga fuckin' my bitch

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when you're around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin'
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart

[Verse 1]
Two tears in a bucket, I cry with you, agh!
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight, I freeze up when I re-up
See, I barely have patience, and you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it? Went to work for it
See, a nine-to-five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment

They say time heals all, but if I can shortcut my success
Corvettes by tomorrow, ugh!

You know the poverty-stricken
The little broke boy and babies (Broke boy and babies)

Then he looked me in the eye
And said "Homie, you're messed up

Never been through 'ish, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
YSay you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t it, I live in a hut
You're living to keep warm, I'm living to pay rent
I paid my way through, praying to Allah
You played your way through, dealing with wi-fi
Bull-'ishing yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope, huh?
These days ain’t no compromise, ugh
Your pain ain’t mines half the time, ugh
A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
See, I made my moves with shackled feet"

Cornrow Kenny
All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt!
Morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt-skrrt!
Cornrow Kenny
So many plays on me, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe-and-Phil
A father figure; play with him, you get killed
Play with me and he-a kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juugin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juugin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 9-11
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Me, I'm about to let my hair down to hoes
Ali 'bout to let his hair down to hoes
Top billing, that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no-whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama, "Be more like Punch"
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mackwop, bet he do what he want
Level two, level two, no, I’m not done
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guaranteed, something that none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Ward is like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
Tell me that, tell me that that I'm the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got tell me that, what! I’m the one
Yes, I’m the one!

[Verse]
It's been a week already, feeling weak already
Got me at peak, possibility of what could be
Situation is heavy, I've got to prove
On February 26th I lost my life too
It's like I'm here in a dark dream
Nightmare, hear screams recorded
Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
Why didn't he defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch?
And for our community do you know what this does?
Add to a trail of hatred
2012 was taped for the world to see
Set us back another 400 years
This is modern day slavery
The reason why I'm by your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumped in your arm
Cut off the engine then sped off in the rain
I'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk
Had the vodka on the top
How come I can long time
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
See I'm living with anxiety
Giving up sobriety
Cussing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice ain't free
Therefore justice ain't me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinking by myself
At the end of Section Park
Caught you when you walk besides your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your spine drip to your arm
Cut off the engine then sped off in a wraith
I said Hiiipower, one time you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Hiiipower, two times you see it
Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us

[Verse 1]
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with the headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely had patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
Went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I could shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

[Hook]
But why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down

[Verse 2]
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a black woman wishin'
She sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

[Hook]
But why I'm so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down to the top

[Bridge]
I love god, I love speed, I love drank, I love me
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
But I’m scared of god speed
Sometimes

[Verse 3]
Wrote this song looking at a broke home maybe
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and baby
Somebody say "Kendrick American they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye
He said homie you messed up
You breaking my good luck
You wishing for miracles
Living through shit, you’re crying hysterical
Settle for everything, complain about everything
Say your soul crack, my world amphetamines
You projects ain’t it, I live in the hood
You living to keep warm
I’m living to pay rent
I paid my way through
Praying to Allah
You played your way through dealing with Wi-Fi
Bull shit yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
Your pain ain’t mine half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
See I made my moves, with shackled feet

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I fucked up the rap game and you ain't even know it
I just fucked what's her name and you ain't even know it (you ain't even know it)
She got a *beep* tattoo and you ain't even know it (real talk)
We about to form a little group and you ain't even know it, let's get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation, and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
It's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin' woman
Stank pussy-poppin' woman
You fuckin' fool don't know about you
But my dick need 17 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell 'em I need my credit when it's due
Tell 'em I need my lettuce when it's new
Tell 'em I got a fetish for fine fabric, Franklins and saying, "Fuck you"
Tell 'em it's TDE 'til I'm DDT'd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
'til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free
I'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup
(Dizzle)
[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
It's a groovy nigga, that's all day, Backwood hold three grams
Got a six-shooter, that revolver spinning, shell stuck inside, but won't jam
This hoody here about two stacks, hell yeah that bitch could gon' go ham
Molly in her drink, but she asked me to and oh yeah I got this on cam
Gangsta nigga, no trap beats, bet I still sound like that new shit
Originality in my blueprint, still Figg side, Figueroa pimp
Her big ass where my palm hit, pull my dick out, she gon' balm it
Swag surfin' all through the world, slide through the sea on a comet
O-X-Y for these morons, that be that new shit I'm pushin'
Raise off of them pockets, bring more of them coffins
These niggas ain't popping, tell them, old niggas, to move on
Aw damn I done said it, all them can beheaded

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
She ain't single but she solo, you ain't even know it
Unsigned with sold out shows, you ain't even know it
My lips black but they ain’t chapped, she ain’t even know that
Let’s have sex, she said, "Yes", you know she ain’t "no" that
Seed of life on my chest, my head next to her breast
My mind all in the clouds, just bought an ounce of the best
No talking when I’m off that loud
I came quick so she pissed
You know I’m good for another round
But it’s hard when everybody on your dick
Know real niggas that’s crips, I know real niggas that’s bloods
Know real niggas that’s thugging like you ain’t know what’s up
Got codeine in my cup, got a couple checks that need cashing
And you could take that to the bank, what’s life without a balance?
You ain't even know it, nigga, I be everywhere you ain’t even going
I thought it was snowing, but I’m just the coldest nigga out here flowin'
Sick of all that bullshit y’all been promoting, but (Soul!)
Carson in the motherfucking house
Del Amo, watch your motherfucking mouth
I took the game by storm, just to X men out
I'm crazy out my mind, I put my life on the line
The tortoise only makes progress when his neck sticks out
Just a little token of gold if you ain't know it, though
[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Respect, I get the utmost
I'm so dope I'm a walking kilo
36 Os, you don't even know I'm gettin' cheese like Cheetos
You mad that we BMFing, bitch-ass niggas steady PMSing
I never show my hands, can't know my plans
Gotta keep them guessing
Rock, I was off the scene
Now a nigga back like a four and a half
Shooting up the set like Spielberg
See the big picture when them hammers flash
I don't post a lot on Instagram
That's the quickest way they'll get you, man
Leave that shit for the bitches man
Alphabet boys, they'll get your ass
IRS, they was on a nigga
Cashed them out, now I'm scot-free
Got my passport in my JanSport, now I'm overseas
You don't even know it
Rock been killin' this shit, no gloves, no mask on me
Just 100 thousand cash on me
Back then, I was doing bad, homie
All my bitches bad now
My old hoes try to keep tabs on me
Safe to say I'm the man now
Fuck ass nigga just stand down
'Fore the shots go up and it's man down
Hands down, still popping
No prescription, I'm flexing
Suplex a pussy, I've been off the edge
Too late to push me, nigga I ain't fell off
Used to move Frosted Flakes like Kellogg's
Pull up to the bank, count paper like tellers
Top Dawg, Money Gang, bitch, we've been on
Clothesline the beat, nigga, John Cena
Been having stripes, can't walk in my Adidas
Kicked in the door, hand on the Nina
Black Hippy shit, rock gon' bleed 'em
[Outro: Future]
I’m turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin’, you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin’, you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don’t even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean, you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from the bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]

(Dizzle)[Intro: Consequence]
Crack's in your pocket
Weed in your pocket
Dope in your pocket
Who the hell could stop it?
You can't get caught with
So you might want it locked in

[Chorus: Consequence]
(I never thought you'd find me)
(I never thought you'd see me)
Crack's in your pocket
Weed in your pocket
(I never thought you'd find me)
Dope in your pocket
Who the hell could stop it?
Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall

[Verse 1: Consequence]
It was around two at night, I saw the blue and whites
There was one black officer and two were white
And I'll admit that I was wrong 'cause I blew the light
But I figured the black one was out to prove he white
And he'd prove me right and wouldn't do me right
So when I rolled the window down he wasn't too polite
Matter fact, he was screaming at the top of his tonsils
I said, "Sir, there's no need to be this hostile."
"Well, Mr. Cons, you got late registration"
I said, "It's me, Cons, from Late Registration"
He looked at me like I ain't take my medication
And this was the cause of his detonation
He told me, "Step away from the vehicle"
This is becoming way too much to read into
He called for back-up, so what'd you expected me to do?
To stand there like a horse at a feeding zoo?
Nah, I did what my feet should do
I tried to bolt but then the white one put the nine millimeter to my throat
And told me, "Freeze, or you'll be risking it all"
And that's how I wound up
[Pre-Chorus: Consequence]
Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall

[Chorus: Consequence]
(I never thought you'd find me)
(I never thought you'd see me)
Crack's in your pocket
Weed in your pocket
(I never thought you'd find me)
Dope in your pocket
Who the hell could stop it?
Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Yea, caught red-handed, ridin' with the cannon
Schemin' and scammin', livin' like Reggie Hammond
A phantom, snapshots from the man's Canon
Pigs got my pictures on the wall like a parent
I be disappearin' but the cameras
'll catch you doin' dirt if you be careless
You gotta be more aware of it
To save yourself the embarrassment of gettin' caught carryin'
They hit me homie with calendars, he was talented
And I'm still fightin' cases out in Maryland and breakin' up marriages
Like packages of white, like Marilyn
Still dabble in the crack game, baggin' it
Feds in the palaces, searchin' through the cabinets
I'm a capitalist, get off that faggot shit
My establishment, that's rather fabulous
Police threw us in the paddy wagon like savages
[Chorus: Consequence]
(I never thought you'd find me)
(I never thought you'd see me)

Yea, this shit got me feelin' kinda like Sunday evenin'
On the pulpit, me and my heathens
Me and Consequence circle your seven continents all in one weekend
Make sure your proposal is decent, get exposed to treason
The last of the dyin' Mohicans when mentionin' rappers
My niggas'll rat-tat-tat you, then kiss your mother right after
Disaster'll strike faster than a thief in the night
The thesis of a black man, policemen never could write
That's why our backs against the walls, gun raised
Takin' out everything, like bank withdrawals before the year 2K
And by the end of the day, I'll be America's most wanted
Shot and confronted while runnin' from the CIA
Livin' life as a rebel, the last Panther stuck in the ghetto
Tuckin' the metal like junkyards and rockstars
The smoke never settles, where I'm from
From a tree to the corner-stores is where we hung, uhh
[Chorus: Consequence]
(I never thought you'd find me)
(I never thought you'd see me)
Crack's in your pocket
Weed in your pocket
(I never thought you'd find me)
Dope in your pocket
Who the hell could stop it?
Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I want to lie
Sometimes I want to school the youth, sometimes I want to ride
Sometimes I want to not think, sometimes I want to vibe
Sometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone out
This song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside
When my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We killed the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much
If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush
If my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be, amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
It's not about the right price but more like the right scam
To rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw
The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
That lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's home
Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity, they parted our families
They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross (uh)
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
400 years of nothing, 400 years of suffering
400 years of tears, and tribulations, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
Called us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit
Of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do
Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to
About a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to 26's after riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the 400 years we never saw
The reason why the next 400 we gotta floss
Slaves

[Outro]
I said the 400 years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change
We over exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got 4,5,6 rings on your finger
Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an 02' Monte Carlo with 24's on it
And on the back of the window it says, "Get on my level ho"
You're a vanity slave
We're all vanity slaves, and with that being said
Can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here, hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month, checks coming in
I'm tryna get some
What up?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I swear you people don't know Kendrick, you don't know him
But you say you want some more Kendrick, I'm 'bout to show 'em
Everything inside this human being, I'm still growing
I'm a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini, I want 'em
Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in they graves
Burning money when I get it, fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements, just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on, I'm a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country, I bought this out the country
Whips and chains, whips and chains, Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta, you my brother, we come from the same modern world
That's ya girl? I see she rocking Fendi
Try this on
If it ain't upscale then you may offend me
Copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the black visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe, that's a punchline
They was hot and I wore ice, that's ironic huh?

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26's
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
It's the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Aw man videos got me wanting hoes
Appetite for flashing lights, all I can do is pose
A black male... on Melrose. I should get blackmailed
By my people hell rose, Niggas that ain't had shit
For 400 years overcompensate by over accessorizing with gear
Man y'all don't see my vision
I do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
Am I a hypocrite cause everyday I'm contradicting
I think of how I'm living, then I watch "How I'm Living" I know this can't be right
My conscience tell me to stay righteous
It's unlikely to see what I like and say I don't like it
Biggest dilemma my priorities ignoring me, I wanna move accordingly
But baby steps are premature remember?
I'm flying to the south and I'll be gone 'til November
To see my family tree but this a shame I'm yelling, out, timber

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26's
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
It's the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Cold, oh so cold
How ironic he bought it then sold his soul
Is it masonic for your vice to take it's toll?
The remote control is taking control
Lift up the doors
That Lamborghini I wanted come with a dumb ass model that in vogue
I like 'em both, I'll wife 'em both
Take these motherfucking Jordan's off, put on my loafs
Cause nothing goes bad, everytime I wear (Gucci)
I'm getting more ass, everytime I wear (Gucci)
They told me it's a fad, everytime I wear (Gucci)
But should I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
This a young nigga's pedigree, I pray the lord can better me
If not he 'bout to strike me down like this my third felony
The voices keep on telling me, Kendrick don't forget about us
I burned my wardrobe, hoping that I could live without it

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26's
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
It's the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave



[Emily Main]
You're the one who gets my heart to race and my arms to sweat
You're the one I'd risk my life and waste it on a bet

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Temptation sweet, I taste it
That casino waitress, drinks sedated
You the one I want, you the one I want, face it
You the one I want on a one-on-one basis
You can see my weakness, a week is not long enough
I need every season and this the only reason
You the one I want, you the one I want
Leave it all on the table even if they catch me cheatin'
Doin' blackjack, twenty-one, twenty thousand in it
Probably twenty more before I'm done
If gambling's a sin, then I'm rollin' dice with Lucifer
To make sure I ain't losin' you
That's what a craps shooter does, I'm bankin' on the win
Bankin' on the last, vacant from the job that I had
Life savings in my pocket
If I never make it back, then I had the option of takin' a risk
So before I slit my wrist, I'm a cash in on this last poker chip
You can bet

[Hook: Emily Main]
Ooh, Vegas, baby, ooh, Vegas, baby
Ooh, Vegas, baby, I was scared of you
Ooh, Vegas, baby, you're Vegas, baby
You're Vegas baby, I was scared of you

[Outro: Emily Main]
You're the one who's got me drinkin' wine until I'm fallin' down
You're the one who keeps the slot machines spinnin' around

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I can't stand myself
Big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit...

[Pre-Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Turn me up
Sin City, Sin City
Sin City, Sin City

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Big money, big booty bitches
Tell the truth, nigga, I'm lost without it
7 figures for a headline
You want some stage time? We can talk about it
Niggas actin' like they be rappin'
Like nice on the mic, truly doubt it
Go against the kid, y'all don't wanna live
That decision is hella childish
Rose gold for my old hoes
They ain't satisfied then I sit 'em down
10th grade, I gave her all shade
But now she got some ass, I wan' hit it now
I don't lease, I just all out feast
I put a blue Caprice on Gary Coleman
Bomb head and some cheese eggs
That's a new raise and a signing bonus
[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Fall in this bitch
Like some good pussy—can't stand myself
So good, she so hood
She a cheesehead, patty melt
GED with some EBTs, and some DVDs
That shit was happening
She reel me in with some chicken wings
And some collard greens, that shit was brackin'
Just cracked me a new bitch
Bust a new nut on her nigga's jersey
My bitch get off at 9 o'clock
So I had to shake her 'round 7:30
105, I'm stomping fast
With these big guns, I'm hella dirty
Get caught with this shit
I ain't comin' home 'til like 2030

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I can't stand myself
I just might ban myself
I just might... God!
[Bridge: Jay Rock]
I'm focused, feeling blessed
'Cause my eyes be the truth
I'm focused, feeling blessed
'Cause my eyes be the truth

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Mental window blurry as a bitch
Still lookin' out it
So much money off the fuckin' books
Could write a book about it
Took a minute, no, wait a minute
Let me think about it
Bout ten years, Crips, Bloods
Sweat and tears, and we still counting
Had a real thick bitch named Brooklyn
She fucked the whole squad
Now every time I land in Brooklyn
They fuck with the whole squad
I'm more spiritual than lyrical
I'm similar to Eli
Why? 'Cause I'm wearin' black shades
And I'm headed west with the word of God (Amen)
Yeah, I think I'm finally ready to talk about it
These niggas just talk about it
Homie don't play me for no fool
Poppin' bottles like enemigos
Os dios mio, I'm so cold
Get so deep in that water, water
They should call my johnson a harpoon
[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Feed the needy, don't know graffiti
Paint her walls like a cartoon
Beat the pussy up so bad
Send her home with some war wounds
Loaded off the 'gnac, hit her from the back
Goin' 'cross her head, bar stool
Touch her soul, 'til I curl her toes
Then it's time to reload, then it's part two

[Verse 5: ScHoolboy Q]
Damn near 30, still set trippin', cuz
Where you from? I'ma see about it
Last year I made ten million
That's where I've been, yeah, a private island
Smoking something, on autopilot
Got too many cars, I might crash a whip
New 'Rari pedal barely tapping
Nigga, vroom-vroom, yeah, I'm rich, bitch
Got two rollies, but one missing
Think my daughter flossing, she in kindergarten
Got one crib worth two cribs
And my front lawn, yeah, that's water fountain
You be talking boss, saying big words
Like philosophies, man, you weird homie
What it sounds to me that you broke as fuck
And your bitch gon' leave, and that's real, homie

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition
That shit gon' be the death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I just might go broke
I can't stand myself
I just might damn myself
I just might... GOD!
GOD!

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Two-two, what's the deal homeboy?
Aye

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Big money, big booty bitches, man that shit, we gon' death of me
You see me on TV thinking "oh, TDE got the recipe"
I cut, call me K. Dot and this is Jay Rock and y'all rest in peace
All the rappers they be talking about, bust right now we gon' IP
Hold up, I said hold up
You thinking oh what? You can't talk about it
If you want to see us come around and move the crowds out
Because we got the loudest
L.A., we in the streets right here
Niggas seen God in projects
Everybody in this crowd right now, go and tell me about that prospect

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Fall in this bitch
Like some good pussy, can't stand myself
So good, she so hood
She a cheesehead, patty melt
GED with some EBTs, and some DVDs
That shit was happening
She reel me in with some chicken wings
And some collard greens, that shit was brackin'
Just cracked me a new bitch
Bust a new nut on her nigga's jersey
My bitch get off at 9 o'clock
So I had to shake her 'round 7:30
105, I'm stomping fast
With these big guns, I'm hella dirty
Get caught with this shit
I ain't comin' home 'til like 2030

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm on Union Square
Kendrick Lamar, violin, we take it there
Me and my man, no one compare
That's like two left shoes, you fools
I'm so rude, my flow is so crude
Spit at the mouth, foam and drool
I'm on top of the world, I'm on my pedestal
Looking under your girl's dress - now that's a mess
Lift my flows like I flip your wife
And pass it to Sounwave down the way
You know he's nice
ADHD, producer, recruit ya
To the armies ?
Take a nigga to war
You know how I'm about to settle the score
Kendrick, Ramal spelled backwards
Come and get me, you're nothing but target practice
You're actors, coming at you with my flows
Like acrobatics. You never can stride into Compton
You get stomped on, what is you're talking about?
You don't want none..

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
So they looking for me
They don't know
I'm waiting on them
Right here, I'ma sit by the window
See they gonna have to get me
Yeah, they gonna have to get me
Come get me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Damn shame, why they let me get a champagne, uh
The young can produce thunder, I make black rain, uh
Blood stain saw all over his black range, uh
Catch him at the lights to turn off his lights mane
Life been treating me right so I can't complain, uh
Career 'bout to take flight, G4 plane (Yep)
I stunt niggas growth in this rap shit
Suggest you react quick or invest in some globe games
I'm propane and hard liquor, bow down to who
What nigga, toss bullets like flea flickers
To the fullest, I'ma get it to the core
And they tape pictures, yellow tape, stretched out, inches
I can't wait like the first day of school
Waking up, three in the morning, looking at my shoes
But this time around, I be looking are my tool
Wiping it down, [?] every other commercial now
Hold my mom, it's nothing to hurt you
Two straps on my side, I'm looking like [?], blaw
Did I do that, yes I did
I told you the truth, cause no witnesses, I'm the truth
Still, I remain calm like a soldier in war
Surrounded by, three bombs, cautious
Shots keep coming like I got three arms
Two trigger fingers over one bomb, let it breathe

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Hm, I'm surprise
Ya'll not here yet
Plans must have change
But I'm still here
I even let the backdoor open
Come on now

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Kill 'em, kill 'em, send 'em to the morgue
Let 'em fill him with a brimming fluid
We ain't sorry for nothing
We ain't tryna play hardcore nothing
But you overdid it when you push the button
So we caught the USSR, push the button on it
Let it blew up a few cars
You really don't want it [?] and your homie don't want it neither
Shoe string, choke 'em up, let 'em get no breather
No pressure, black and white, the skies
Looking like uncle Fester, poppin' up on you guys
The .22 fit right between my bitch thighs
If you blink once, it be pointing right between your eyes
You better off tryna plan your own suicide
Cause it's nothing, but torture if you want you to die
The 745 got weed in it, riding with the .45, times two the speed limit
I pop eyes for a [?] that spinach
Cut 'em down to the white meat, have 'em no skinnin'
I'm not finish until my niggas ate too
So any given time they can grace you
What you want? Casket, await due
My pain in a box is quite more you
So they can see the damage done at the wake view
Hide 'em hollow tips, hopscotch on the face you breathe

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
So ya'll still ain't here
So I guess there's a first time for everything if ya'll don't come
But I'm still here
In fact I'm still waiting for someone else
Punch

[Verse 3: Punch]
Yeah, I got the range of a [?]
From nine hundred yards by the grass I been walkin'
See, so don't think I don't see you dudes creepin'
Reaching for my spot, then spot a niggas breathin'
A grown man, ya'll cats barely [?]
Lil dudes tryna catch me like they wide receiving
Stop it, [?], custom drop it
That's one point two, minus the roof, don't stop rams
I'm in the cockpit, windows up, black tint
I'm not from 'round here, it's like I breathe with an accent
Whether you has been, future or present
I remove you from your flesh, teach you dudes a lesson
'Cuse the digression, abuse studio sessions
I'ma fool on the [?], the dude, no question
Uncomfortable homie, barefoot in the booth
Stop and breathe for a second, inhale the truth
Breathe niggas

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm restless know
Ya'll took to long
Maybe next time
Or maybe even I come to you
Hm, but for know
I'ma just get my



[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes
Don't walk away from me

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
Fragmented memories
Sentences incomplete
That's when she said
"Don't wanna put up a fight anymore
I'm down to the end of my rope
And I'm freefalling
I'll search inside myself
I need to know why I act this way"
A whisper turns to a scream
I can't ignore it no more

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
From my eyewitness binoculars (uh-huh)
To Argentina and Africa (uh-huh)
We mastered the (what?) pressure (yeah)
Hazardous (uh-huh), harassing us (that's right)
You laugh at us (you did)
More accurate at bagging dimes, now we bagging rhymes
Bodybags, price tags on your forehead
Nine times out of ten, young niggas are nine or ten
When the line becomes thin: be a killer or fireman
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I can't deny sin, condolences through these palms
I remember when your cousin was coming home
My bitch, why we plotted to kill him 'cause we ain't know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin'
We ain't want none of that urgent call
Well, I'ma act Turk and fall on my identity, percocets
For all the headaches, I'm 'bout to bring confetti
Tumble out this barrel soon as it ring, you ready?
That was the word 'for we moved on 'em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone come and can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
Your cousin wa'n't coming home from the pen but from the army
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read
Even though a bullet hit him in the leg, still walk on by

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby that's how it goes
Don't walk away from me

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes
Don’t walk away from me

[Intro]
It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

[Verse 1]
I used to wanna rap like JAY-Z
Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
Of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
I ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard

[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Verse 2]
What up DZYNE? I ain't forgot nigga
You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first, that's what's for sure
At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
And I was wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
But I'm telling you we ain't done
Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
With school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
Me, you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard

[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Verse 3]
So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?
That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays
Like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
To grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a Black one
With Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city
My niggas, tell me you with me
And if you is won't you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
Yeah, uh huh

[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Outro]
D-Dave, what up nigga?
Matt Jeezy, hahaha...

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Ha-ha-ha, ha, uh

[Verse]
I said chilling in my tipi, no Indian but he be
The realest shit, I must admit, I'm basking in my feces
My style is harder, yours is watered down, Fiji
The bible or my CD? Both of them are said to be the
Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill
Houseparty with killers, pray for it to defill us
Where exes think it's buffy, and chandeliers hang from ceilings
I'm dreaming, I'm scheming to be major
Composer like I'm Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus
Today is, the day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain
The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
Paper by the forest tree, acres of the THC
I don't smoke but homies do, find a cloud then have a seat
Wonder how Meyer Lansky live to see 80
I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes
'Knahmean?

[Pre-Chorus]
And guess what?
I need all of mine's—mo' paper, mo' dough
I need all of mine's—more pussy, more hoes
I-I need all of mine's—and yeah, publishing, can't forget publishing
Nigga
[Chorus]
Just ride, don't ask where we going (Ay)
Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no Boeing (Ay)
Baby take your time, I'ma keep it in control and
Give you what you need and give you what you want in life

[Outro]
I need all of mine's
I need all of mine's
I-I need all of mine's
Just ride, don't ask where we going
Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no bowing
Baby take your time, I'ma keep it in control
Give you what you need and give you what you want in life

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, ho, hey, want me
Hey, ho, hey, want me
Hey, ho, hey, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I wanna see you fall through, quick, fast, without havin' to call you
Quick fast, I know just what they all do
But you can do it better and it's all cool
Never seen a stop sign or a stop light
I wanna see what livin' on the top like
You wanna see what livin' on the top like
Then shadow me and take me on a joy-ride
Look both ways wherever there I go
In case I run into you, I drive slow
I know your sex-drive go all day
Then we can roll [?] 'till tomorrow
Lights out for the insecure, self-centered
I know your heart won't be the same when I
Dive in head first, I don't mind if I drown
In other words, girl I need you right now
I said--

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me

[Bridge 2: [Sample]]
Just like I want you
Just like I want you
Just like I want you
Just like I want you

[Bridge 3:Q-Tip]
She needs me, uh, I need her, uh
Downtown, uh, me first, uh, me first, uh me first
She needs me, uh, I need her, uh

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I wanna pick your brain too, I wanna get the brain too
Tell the truth I might even stand in the rain to (I might even stand in the rain)
Just to make you rain too
See your last one didn't recognize your worth (Uh-huh)
All good I let him go first, all good I let you go first
I come right after then second round occur

[Shortened Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me

[Bridge 2: ?]
Just like I want you

[Verse 1]
Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
I never felt the feeling of euphoria
Pain forever or prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
Wake up in the morning and I gotta win
Not taking the victory, that's my only sin
And so I send a message to your messenger
A warning shot to let em know I'm serious
I'm ready for a war, when I roar it can break a glass window
The only thing for sure: the perfect way to bend you
On your back even if I gotta slither through the cracks
I can crack every code you deliver, I attack
Every hole where the bomb squad sit it on the tripod
Even if you try hard, he can still die hard
Run but you can't hide: white flags
You can pull em out fast and tell me your last goodbye

[Hook]
I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love

[Verse 2]
Make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing
You know I take risk: dark clouds, I love it
Cause I can hide in the mist, hop out
And crush every soldier you're with, so I'm 6 for 6
I'm sick with determination: I'll terminate ya quick
I lead the pack, I follow no rules
I see the traps, I know you're close to
Falling on your face, unload, reload
Hand me another case, explode, explode
The fire of my eyes is waiting on your demise
I know you hope your help is close by

[Hook]
I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
There's sixteen ounces to every pound
Some shit is 'bout to go down
Got sixty-four of 'em
That's four of 'em, smoke somethin'
Burn it down, this shit is four for a pound
Y'all need cream, that's equivalent to a sixteen
See, when I'm rappin' I'm trappin'
Wasn't really good, well, subtract
Then I'm steady addin', this is just a fraction
Blunt matchin' after matchin'
Matchin' after matchin'
All by myself, ask Michael Phelps
Bean pies and Philadelph' cheesesteaks on the menu
Projects' right across from the venue
After the show, I went outside and mingled
I'm feelin' safe with the homie named God who's great
Elijah Muhammad the 8th
The Muslim homie told me he's straight
Sent him a dub and a demo tape
Penetrate the streets with the heat
Like [inaudible], global warmin' in December
Bathe in the [inaudible], that's how the kids' raised
So a burner ain't nothin'
Shoot him in his back for cold frontin'
Let him hold somethin', he with the Devil down south
Tell his ass to walk it out
Burner in his mouth, blindfolded on the couch
Give me the loot, give me the loot 'fore I shoot
Rip a tooth and your tonsils too
Exit out your neck bone, man, your shit gone
I'm [inaudible] and notorious
Niggas always gettin' me understood
Better ask your hood, they know what's good
Warnin' shot, Q, bitch
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I could stand in a pool of gasoline lightin' a blunt
And never catch on fire
How come? You silly motherfucker, I'm fire
Smack the Devil over the cheek
Gave him a third-degree burn
Iced it down the same week and told him, 'You'll be okay'
A lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day
They hydroplanin'
They hopin' that they catch they big break
What are you sayin'?
I feel I'm the one like a magician
With a stick inside his hand of a name of a messy cane
I gets ignorant with you
Snap your picture, bitch, I'm famous
I came in this world with nuts in my palm
And drinkin' Paul Masson
In a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron
Locked him in a basement and amputated his shootin' arm
Now that's a stretch, Ab-Soul
Like the fifty-mile strip when I'm pimpin' these hoes
Call me Dolemite, no, I take that back
Found out he gay as a [inaudible] or the way that they rap

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I wish I had the very first verse I wrote
I'd spit it right now
So you can see the vast progression and the style
Started as a child
Now I'm a grown man like Benjamin Button in his fifties
Fuck with me
Still ain't learnt the power of a dollar, disregardin' Fif'
Not cause I don't like him, just cause I don't save shit
So high on my horse
If I fall off I get kicked by a hoof 'fore I hit the hood
And that was over they head, but I wish a nigga would
Disrespect my intellect, I'm a cocky individual
No subliminals, try to attack and I'll react like chemicals
The doc should've brought him some of my mom's inner tubes
Cause now I'm in the view of millions, takin' interviews
I got interludes better than your singles
Won't stop till I got a better reason to [inaudible]
And if any of y'all want a piece of the God
On 12/25 we send grief to your squad
The only problem I got now is label offers on the table
Like a table cloth is but I'm cautious
I'm like what Jaws is to crawfish
The big shot, that's why I talk my shit
That's why they on my dick
Like them little tricks that I taught your bitch
She'd probably lick it if I unzipped these Dickies
You need to quit it, knock it off
I'm in your girl ear like a cotton swab
And anythin' I say, I'm a blame it on that alcohol
Like T-Pain on a song with Jamie Foxx
I'm here cause it's my time, you came to watch
Every day it's ceramics class, pass the pot

[Intro]
Come on
Yeah
Punch, what's happening brother?
Niggas be poppin' that shit at me like it's something new to me or something, know what I'm talking about
I tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me, nigga
I've been doing this shit since Vanguard, brother
And tell me what's happening with it
Niggas hate on me but hop right on my dick as soon as they see me
Soon as they see me, they be like

[Verse 1]
What up doc
That's what they tell me every second around the clock
Everytime I clock in, rappers checkin' they watch
Studio paid for, hours unlimited
Assholes, how many MC's I knock off they payroll?
How many God MC's I knock off they halo?
Hip-Hop ain’t dead, consumers changed up
Rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
I stay low, like my socks under my ankles
Play the back like a turtle shell, know well
That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit, so if I fall?
Guess what, I don't even trip
It's like that, crushin' little battle raps
Punchlines, I did that in '99, you think it's a gold mine when you think of one
You think you hot, but I think you done
Like Queens, New York slang, look what the killer brung
Machine guns to a fight, fucking right
Pay the bill or I'm turning out your lights, good night
I shatter niggas' dreams, thinkin' they the West Coast kings
Till I drop like visine, tell a nigga quick, it ain't always what it seems
Like the stitching on swap meet jeans
I'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper, snuff him like a rude capper
Got a cool bladder, but I'm pissed off, at ya

[Hook]
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me? I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, "Are you not entertained?"
Body any nigga that wanna holla my name
And what, no cut, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up

[Verse 2]
Nigga said he'd snatch my chain in the streets
What chain? I barely wear jewelry
So I ever had one, you barely seen it on me
And if I ever had a gun, you wouldn't know it was on me
So snatch it and then you're done
I'm in a studio, just sipping on Parmesan
Thinkin' about who could fuck with Kenny and Paula's son
I live this shit, try stop me, you won't live to shit properly
Catch four between your abdomen
Next time you see me, don't ask me who I'm collabin' with
Between me and you, some of the new West is actresses
New hate activists, lowkey can't stand our shit
But still we continue to drink laxatives
Cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget
This is mine don't touch (pow pow), did I stutter?
Catch two, cats knew, I been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo
Yup, you little monkeys know what it do, come test me

[Hook]
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me? I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, "Are you not entertained?"
Body, any nigga that wanna holla my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up

[Verse 3]
Dayum, you killin' 'em K-Dizzle
And if you don't kill 'em, then you send 'em to hospitals
Sleepin' on a recliner bed, with a thin pillow
I'm with a white bitch, ass like a black widow
Bet I dribble to the end of my lifeline
So when I die, you can say I balled for a long time
The 0-8 Frankenstein, beast like Sasquatch
Feet size thirty-six, steppin' on Hip-Hop 'cause that's my bitch
I write a rhyme, then she ride my dick
The girl is mine, I don't know the ho that you with
You niggas know this, I'm way better than I've ever been
So focused, like a sniper when he zoom in
What's your motive?
I bet it's to go against, like the GT
Get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets
I'm the almighty K, Compton
Rep it 'til my very death day, let the reaper in his face
And recite every song from NWA
I pay homage for those great who paved the way
Wait, back to the subject of who's, and who doesn't do what I do
Bluffin' until I touch 'em like a masseuse do
Nothing compares to me, but the throne, so tell 'em bring the chair to me
I'm a rare bully, small nigga but I handle y'all niggas like I'm eight feet tall
Nigga

[Intro: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Chh- (slurp)

Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
I'm a soldier mane, thought I told ya mane
I aim and flame ya, I'm the pro-to-pane Ahh
Niggas sizing me up like I'm buying a tux
So I interrupt, crease 'em, iron 'em up
With the nina, not talking 'bout the two singers
'Cause a leprechaun wouldn't even press his luck
I'm sure to pluck any chicken with a rhythm I could fuck
I tell 'em call me up
Like is it on or what?
Can I cut 'til dawn, or what?
A slut say she want a slice of all of us
Intelligent, say her marble's marvelous
She go down south like black colleges
I'm a psychologist, I tell her I can adjust
Anything in the world that be bothering her
Everywhere I go, guarantee she go
Pussy pop on the low, like a silencer
[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damn it I'm the brightest

Uh, back to the realist shit
Niggas ain't raw, you grillin'
I'ma menage a woman and I—
Barrage be intimate, a massage beginning with
Caress from her tongue, deep throat raw
Lot's of trauma, your baby momma
Brain is crazy—Jeffrey Dahmer
And I'm finna shoot—like a dirty llama
Big truck kicking up dust—conquer
Chocolate seats—Willy Wonka
Passenger—Pretty Woman
Direct a fact—bring your compass
You bringing Carson—you bringing Compton
Y'all bring the nonsense
We bring the real, like Pro Tools, never gross 500 mil
And we out in Brazil, in the green like Blanka
Bonkers—tell 'em Top Dawg is here

Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Ab-Soul]
I think it's that, give us that gat
Whatever war you bring, just send me to Iraq
I rap like my tongue was sitting on a match
You struck by lightning, frightening, gotta be a Heisman
Trophy, low-key, the one and only
Slay a ho, play a ho like a oldie
Yup, and I'm dope like Opie
Um, so I'm out when the police
Come, like a nut, I'm a nut
For the bucks like a shotgun bust, and I bust
Venom inside the brains of young dames
Like Mr. Dash speaking to his kids on Jay-
Z—We runnin' the game
Y'all slipping like run in the rain
Ya bitches running away from y'all to us
In God we trust, at y'all we bust

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
I cut my hair and bump my head and fell on top
And run on sins, and front on friends
If we don't win then pay your Tithes and mend your fence
And we alright, the Kaio Ken and big old rims
And LA hoes, if that ain't wrong, if I ain't gone
I ain't home, I ain't them, I ain't them
No more ends and no more trends
And photo tint and photo lens, notice this
Pour this shit, bonafide, woe is me
Bowl of grits, naked pimp, beamin' up, clean as fuck
Other side chill for niggas, makin' life look clear for niggas
Hill for niggas, tip top cliff for niggas, this the vision side to side
So give the nigga, if we honest you gon' miss a nigga
Twisted with 'em, this the isms
See your bitch might kiss a nigga, which nigga? Get specific
Big ass pot, wrist is glistened, your list is shit
And your, if it isn't, this cost some titties and scar your face
The wrong of wrongs has caught a case
Other niggas they Mobb like Carter say from far away
All my niggas like "Calm down"
Lovin' life above a reason, just can't find it like a dozen people
Catch that vibe at night, and Bobby Whitney
Get too tired to write and died in prison
Felt like Rob tonight, lost my god tonight?
[Hook: Zacari]
Oh sometimes I get so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now
Let's go

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
How many souls do you touch a day?
How many hoes do you fuck a day?
How many flows do your thought convey?
How many know you can't walk away?
Depending on the way I feel, I might kill everybody around me
Might heal everybody around me, how the wind blow
Open your window, let the debris in, never let me in
I kick back with kick do'
Maybe if I could live hundred years that be real?
Pay me if I'mma be rhymin' these homonyms
Crazy, my other show went to my mom 'n' 'em
My daddy said a Mercedes had haunted him
But now he got one, I'm ridin' shotgun
With a three-piece chicken dinner and shot gun
I bring your weekend to an ending and pop one
I'm in the deep end, boss nigga you not one
And I believe in Kool-Aid and God's son
Do you believe that Black man is our sun?
I made enough residuals to hide some
I gave enough, my niggas know I divide some
I told Zay, I'm the best rapper since twenty five
Been like that for a while now, I'm twenty-nine
Any nigga that disagree is a fuckin' liar
Pardon me, see my alter ego was Gemini
Him and I been around ever since Reagan was criticized
Might stay in the Trump Tower for one week
Spray paint all the walls and smoke weed
Fuck them and fuck y'all and fuck me
I proceed my last check in proceeds
To all the kids, the hood, the bricks, the books
To fix the blocks we on to right my wrongs
The word, to give the life we live as I get...
[Hook: Zacari]
...so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now
Let's go

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
Oh you got two Xannies, oh, just don't forget me
Love me for the moment (all in the air now) hug me like your sibling
Weed ain't that important, vice cops in the kitchen
Grew with Apollonia (all in the air now) Rob was makin' chicken
Beat me down, you beat me down, reorganize my face
Now when I go home, I don't know what my fam gon' say
Zay, say it ain't love cause you bought flowers yesterday
Thoughts was always cheap, cheap, cheap
But now let's talk 'bout me, me, me
Lately I been comin', this ain't goin' how I wanted
When I pull up at your window, bitch come out, you hear that beep, beep, beep
Faithful as your EBT, closer than you momma kin
Anger when you rang about my dog but I'm gon' call again
Freak me out, keep me out, why they always leave me out
Niggas that been hatin'  just can't wait to have my CD now
Don't we look like CP and Nirvana on that keep me pound
Please be down, I been more than late...
[Hook: Zacari]
Oh sometimes I get so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my breath
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now
All in the air now
Let's go

[Outro: Dave Free]
Okay, I'mma tell you this story, man...A few years ago, I gave my pops, uh, Cilvia, Cilvia Demo and my pops said, uh...he listened to it for about a week, came back to me, said, uh...said, "Dang, boy, why...Zay talkin' 'bout he gon' run up in somebody house? He...he...he talkin' 'bout you?"

[Verse 1: Emjae]

Two in their ass and one in their head
And bitch I ain't stopping 'till I get this bread
I know that you heard me but do as I said
I'd rather be [?] than [?] with the feds
I'm back at the bridge
You niggas is sipping on 40's, I'm topping the keg
You know how we play
Like G's coming up off the [?]
Two in their ass and one in their head
And bitch I ain't stopping 'till I get this bread
I know that you heard me but do as I said
I'd rather be [?] than [?] with the feds
I'm back at the bridge
You niggas is sipping on 40's, I'm topping the keg
You know how we play
Like G's coming up off [?]

[Hook: Emjae and (Jay Rock)]

Watts boys in the hood spit nothing but that hot shit
Doing what we gotta do to make a profit
Keep that thing on your waist cause niggas poppin'
Hesitate cuz, they'll let you feel them shots boy
(Watts boys don't play
Watts boys stay struttin'
Watts boys survey
Watts boys bust gats
Watts boys pushing weight
Watts boys got cake
Watts boys throw K's
Watts boys throw [?])

[Verse 2: Emjae]

They hate your boy cause he ripping up your track
I was gone for a minute but now I'm back
I never fall victim to the struggle
Keep your eyes on that nigga cause you know I'm 'bout to rumble
They call me Emjae
Got a cerebral for the stingers
Competition gets the finger
When I'm switchin' my demeanour
I'm hotter than that 745 series Beemer
I blaze so many trees, when I leave smoke lingers
I been addicted spittin'
Niggas freestylin', they grittin'
Get to forgettin', then it's on they album when it drop
My verses steady, be hittin'
I do this here for a livin'
Flow with precision, yeah you know my style is too hot
You know I'm lava
Instinctive just like MacGyver
Pop haters, like they surprised
Don't fuck with those night riders
I treat my rap book like a whole Ki
Keep it on the low then get if off like a OG

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]

K.Dot get dough
K.Dot get paid
K.Dot get hoes
K.Dot is not afraid
Whenever them vultures, start flocking 'round my way
Got my back against the wall, uh, I'm ready to spray
Standing by the lightpost, breakfast
Got my hand on my hand on my right toes
Cause shit gets, hotter than Hell's Kitchen
When fingers itching, it's more scratching
The DJs practice mixing
It's not baseball, but we stay pitching
No waist like [?], I'm trying to tell who you are
Somebody come up missing, I swear it never fail y'all
Bullets is like shadows, the way that shit [?] y'all
Them feds got the line tapped, so we make collect calls
Local payphone, Superman, no cape on
Monkey on my shoulders, I got the [?] apes on
We love blowing up shit, my style is like napalm
What nigga?, who nigga?, begin to fuck with the kid
And we'll shoot, at you niggas, what type of shit you got in?
Yeah, it's just a simple assignment
To make to make you niggas lose conscience

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]

I roll deep like the president
Nigga Watts is my resident
On the block I hustle hard for them presidents
Raised in a dangerous environment
In the projects where you gotta stay close to [?]
He like a fireman
Refrigerator filled with no food, only a lot of gin
So much weed smoke in the place, can't breathe in oxygen
Job didn't work, back in the hood selling rocks again
I'm starving, real [?] so I gotta feed my poppas then
It's gutta, I'll rob a nigga for birds
Leave his coupe on fire
Leave his brains on the side of the curb
In the hood, yeah I'm blowing that herb
My phones tapped, Rock making business over the chirp
Yeah the block stay hot, like a furnace
[?] the corner with a burner
Put a shell to their back, like a hermit
This is just a warning dog
You made us [?]
They don't want it with them boys from Watts, California

[Intro: Gee Watts]
One for the money, two for my bros
Three for the city, now everybody knows

[Verse 1: Gee Watts]
Watts up, no faking – one shot taken
My life was enticed with mayhem, just praying to God I'd make it
City hot as Jamaicans, laying naked with Satan
Just a kid, but what I did would probably leave Jesus shaking
For real – it get real in the field, they kill for pills
And sling packs to dingbats, hoping they’ll cop ‘em some wheels
Niggas start hating, that pistol start clapping
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tatting, no yapping, dapping
Fake fashions? That’ll never happen
We really with this shit – you clowns jiggy rapping
Gee like if Biggie happened to splice with Pac and get it cracking
I take action on acting, I ain’t playing with you
Real whales gave me game, soaked like kiddie pistols
K.Dot gave me respect, the homie like “you crazy blessed”
We finna blow like C4 with no bull in that text
Yes – Mike Jack wouldn’t make it in this thriller
Watts up, watch everybody get familiar

[Chorus: Gee Watts]
One for the money, two for my bros
Three for the city, now everybody knows
Watts up in this motherfucker
Watts up in this motherfucker

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Swallow your pride and then eat a dick, uh
Make the rulers apologize, you ain’t ruling shit, uh
I’m Rick Rubin in ’85 with the beard thick
Thick bitch, type Peruvian, slanted eyes, that’s quench
They tell you that I’m one-up, from sundown to sunup
Son, I son niggas, I probably fucked your mama
With no condom, that’s good pussy
Pussy, tell it to your honor, this drama is Jeffrey Dahmer
It took me through many moons just to set up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kick-pushed with push brooms
Man, look, your man look like Sweet Water
Cornbread that break under pressure if he caught up
Big homie said “I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ever run my mouth then my legs'll get cut off”
See, I’m just a young boss in the bat cave
Back against the wall, and if I fall, Gee Watts bring it back, bang

[Chorus: Gee Watts]
One for the money, two for my bros
Three for the city, now everybody knows
Watts up in this motherfucker
Watts up in this motherfucker
One for the money, two for my bros
Three for the city, now everybody knows
Watts up in this motherfucker
Watts up in this motherfucker



[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
We ball, we drink
Fuck hoes, rock mink
New watch, gold links
She going down, no teeth

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
LA, that's me, you wanna meet somebody, ask me
You wanna see somebody, ask me
Ay, I tell her let's get in the back seat
Yo crew, last week, my niggas, mad deep
My bitch, bad piece, yo bitch got bad feet
I pray to God, I never flop, I get a loft, a better spot
Another Rollie, a better watch, I get a plane, and then a yacht
And my haters, let 'em watch, line 'em up, give 'em shots
Don't save 'em, just let 'em drop
They said I'd never make it to the top
But we ball, take shots, I won another, it don't stop
Ya big mouth, a big Glock, I love you all, fuck the cops

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot
We ball, bust a shot

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Okay, I'm riding through Leimert, my tires in reverse
I'm lost but I know this foreign navigation works
I made a right on King, I seen a couple skirts
I said "bitch get in but dust them sandals off first"
Okay, I'm doing 105 on 105
Witnesses had said they seen a ball of fire
Bitch I'm tryna president at Jive while you talking jive
All these presidents, won't be surprised if one came alive
I only fuck with playas and pimps nigga
You a created player like Sims nigga
My cup be filled up to the brim nigga
Yo bitch fixing her make-up in my rims nigga
You just target practice
Everybody say they seen it but nobody know what happened
What happened yesterday baby girl fix your mood
Cause I don't like my head with some attitude
And I don't like your legs 'less they at the roof
Pedicure toward the ceiling, mollys in the cabinet too
Pop, pop, pop, popping pussy rather casual
Section 80 paid me ho so this is what I had to do
Ball, I ball, iPhone, million dollar missed calls
I hit the bank, withdrawals
I make her plank, with no drawers
Mothafucka, I ball

[Outro: Ric Flair]
But the bottom line is
[Interruptions]
I’m talking right now, and let me tell ya something
If you like talking to me on this show
You’ll let me talk when I'm out here
[*Attempted Interruptions*]
The bottom line for these people right here is
If you’re a man, you don’t cry about it
Ya take life, the ups and downs
If you’re a real man, ya never go down, ya just stay up
That’s why I’m the World Champion
That’s why this sport coat cost Eight hundred dollars
And that cost two hundred
And I dunno what that cost, I’d be ashamed to wear it
That’s why I wear Lizard shoes, and a Rolex watch
And I’ve got a limousine sitting out there, a mile long
With twenty-five women, just dying for me to go
Woo!
Because I'm the World Champion, sucker
No man's gonna take this from me unless it's done in the ring
And next time you have the opportunity, talk to your accountant
And look who built the building your officed in



[Verse 1: Murs]
Now I'm the one that you call when it's time to ball
With my west coast niggas, this is a 3 piece, y'all

Star in my own right, [?] zone tight
When I'm in my zone, you know I'm going all night
Turn the lights out, [?]

Touch an NBA live wire and get burned

[Chorus: Murs]

Going crazy, now they calling, calling
Living like this, you know we flawless

Ballin out of control, like an offencive
[?] you should know my style
[?] like a root canalle
[?] I'm the truth, you should wipe me down
Matter fact, you should follo my word
I'm in a merger lane with Murs looking for [?]

Footprints, so you know I came

[Chorus: Murs]

Going crazy, now they calling, calling

[Intro] x16
We Get High

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac
In his prime, thug life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickriding, I'm addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
"Compton!", a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit, now everybody sing that shit

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Smoking, choking, always rollin' something
I don't need a key to start my car bitch, I just push a button
Did a show and got a half a mill and spent it like it's nothing
Money flowing, never sober
Smoking till I got concussions, no discussions
Man I got a condo and got a big crib
Pounds all over my kitchen is
If I ain't on the road gettin' it
Then I'm in the hood where my niggas live
Did a tour, sold it out, just bought a pound 'bout to finish it
Now all my pasta got shrimp in it
You talk about and I'm living it
Fucking little bitch

[Verse 1]
It gets so hard
Just trying to figure it out, fighting doubt
Tryna believe God
Tryna watch the words of my mouth and stay on the route
Troubles come and go
Even on the mountain high or the valley low
Never let your faith go (Ooh)
Never let your faith go (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I've been there before
So confused, don't know which way to go, ay
Stressed out
World so crazy might as well as stay in the house
Fear tryna rise up
Got terrorist disguised, they look like us
But we know who we trust
Trust when I say that

[Chorus]
We gon' be alright, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright, alright
We gon' be alright, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright, alright

[Verse 3]
In these last days
Evil times will come and it's here today
Look at all the hate
Senseless crime and murder every day
Human trafficking, racism, police brutality
Bullying, rape, child molesta-
Shun the appearance of evil I pray

[Verse 4]
Let Your Kingdom come, let Your will be done
In the Earth
Let Your glory rise, let Your Son shine
Let it burst
Through the dark clouds
Even through the storm and the rain
We will shout
'Cause we know after the night

[Chorus]
We gon' be alright
Hey, all things work together for good
We gon' be alright (Wooh)
Time and time again He brought me out, I knew He would
We gon' be alright, ay
I ain't worried 'bout it (Oh no)
Don't you worry 'bout it, ay (Oh no)
I believe, I receive every word that He promised me
We gon' be alright (Wooh, oh Jesus)
We gon' be alright (Ay, we believe You)
We gon' be alright
Ay, don't worry 'bout it (Oh no)
Don't lose no sleep over it, ay (Oh no)
Just believe and receive every word that He promised ya
We gon' be alright
So lift your hands up
We gon' be alright
Ay, hallelujah
Just give Him worship, yeah
We gon' be alright
I ain't worried 'bout it (Oh no)
I won't lose sleep over it, ay (Oh no)
He got everything under control, that's how I know that
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright (Yeah)
We gon' be alright
The battle isn't yours, this belongs to the Lord
Stand still, don't fight, we know that
We gon' be alright

[Outro]
It's gonna be alright now
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright now
It's gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright now
Be alright
It's gonna be alright now

Beyoncé, Beyoncé, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Beyoncé, Beyoncé, Beyoncé, Beyoncé[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I can't be stopped
It's payday and I'm in the candy drop
So for real, Candy Rain flooding your spot
Firestone tires hot, burning the block
For pete's sake I'm a heatwave melting your dot
My ship sail, so I should move units and quick
The whip trail like a mixed, variation of chips
So when I dip, it's kinda ironic
And all I do is hotbox Hydro, call it a carpool
I'm from the west, where the Tec's is drawn like Cartoon Network
Wetshirt, a marksman will become my ex expert
Welcome to school fools, don't get an F for effort
Top Dawg money gang, winter fresh, sunny chain
Bad bitches
Angry paper, got mad riches
Who the fuck you think you're up against? Come again?
Shades darker than the bitch, but I see you niggas
And I, see you niggas, wouldn't wanna be you niggas

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to the C4
I got the bombs and the rental
Meet me on Central, and Rosecrans
Goddamn, I'm the man, for life
The left coast, bitch get it right
Welcome to the C4, got the bombs and the rental
[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
It's Top Dawg
They call me Rock, boy
Shit I came a long way from selling rocks, boy
'Bout my cash money, you can call me hot boy
I throw shots, guns clap, like an encore
B's up, hoes down, that's right blood
Can't be street sweepers, get your ass mopped up
Damn, I'm in a 2008 something
Sitting on chrome buttons, nigga no bluffing
Hit a club, all eyes on my neck
Got $20,000 worth of diamonds on my chest, nigga
Fuck VIP, I'm on the floor chunking up my sets
Twisting fingers with my niggas, blowing swishers, sipping liquor, 'till I'm pissy, fucking bitches, it's so easy
Get the name, tell them the telly nothing but pipe in their belly
.380 keep it on my waist like a celly
K.Dot 'bout to bomb on you niggas, get ready motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
I keep a big loaf of the toast, be careful when the toaster pop (Q)
Hashbrowns and all, shooting out tater tots
Around 8 o'clock I let it go for 8 a pop
Taking off wigs like I'm working at a beauty shop
I'm getting money, most success what I'm achieving
Being broke is childish and most of these rappers teething
Still whipping the stick-shift, bottles pop, big sips
Green hash in the back, something to make my heart skip (damn)
You ain't seen a dresser that's fresher and keep it ghetto
Had a gat utter, sing to you; Reuben Studdard
See my team rougher, y'all fat; cream puffer
Your broad serve the whole squad, call her clique fucker
Start to thinking that I'm the best, just sort of speaking
More than decent, and fucking something that's Puerto Rican
I'm cool as ever, not concerned about the weather
Getting every dollar, I'm steady stacking my cheddar
Hard as ever, y'all cats soft as a feather
Super clever, outdoing me? Nigga never
Try to fuck me out my cash, dawg I'm no pussy
Got big cajones, my nigga you can't douche me
Look, hard as a rock, look, yo I'm hard to smash
New in-dash, bump loud, speakers blast
Heard a couple of your songs, your whole shit was trash
Fucking over the game, your whole squad is ass
[Hook]

[Verse 4: BO]
Yeah, I tell 'em, I tell 'em, bang, bow, pop the man shit
As a young whippersnapper, been toting guns in my pants
Niggas bitches, niggas snitching, yeah they taking the stand
Cause a nigga on the block moves a couple of grand
Coming in wild, with 32 guns, and 10 guys, 3 Puerto Rican bitches, and a couple of 9s
Shit, BO never stopping, cause the flow is a headache, and my swag is a Oxycotin
It's Top Dawg money gang, 20 grand verte chain
Bentley GT, 3 pieces, nigga fuck a raise
Hustle like I'm broke man, advise you to do the same
Nigga rob me? Better knock it off man
Shit, these niggas teddy bear soft
They pull up to new coupe, watch me fucking knock their top off
Bone marrow falling off, Mr. Swag dance, still lean, to the left, when they taking my pants
Try to play this MC like he was light, cause you can get it worse than Harold did at that red light
Pimping 24/7 like the day to the night
Now you mad cause your girlfriend giving head right

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Moving through the block like a centipede
No rooftop, who hot? I'mma show them where the antifreeze
I hit the dealership, and tell them hand me keys, like a grand pianist
Damage anything said, then landing on top of your bitch, oops I tripped
I'm clumsy like Michelle Williams, or Jaleel White
I feel like a Predator, and none of you Danny Glovers are ready for, Alien tactics
The god is back, they're on their knees praying like a mantis
As I perform like Santa Clause
Pause TVs in the Phantom
Bitches on my left and my right like I pant them
Dancing on the coast, emerging from the smoke
Pimping in my blood, tell doc to check my pulse
They knew that was K.Dot the gemini, with another cut like a Samurai
Anything else is uncivilized
Fucker

[Part I]

[Yara Shahidi]
(Laughs) What are you doing?

[Baby Keem]
Watchin' the sun.

[Yara Shahidi]
Yeah? Why are you watching the sun?

[Baby Keem]
I’ve always wondered why people say we shouldn't stare at this powerful source of energy. Made me curious.

[Yara Shahidi]
What if you go blind?

[Baby Keem]
I've never heard of anyone goin’ blind from starin' at the Sun.

[Yara Shahidi]
Guess you got a point there. Have you seen anything yet?

[Baby Keem]
Many things.

[Yara Shahidi]
Like what?

[Baby Keem]
See for yourself. You should turn off the phone.

[Baby Keem]
Welcome to the present.

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Too many opinions in the glasshouse
This world full of ego, let me cash out

Jump in that—, jump in that bitch (Ho)
Jump in that— (Ho), jump in that bitch (Ho)
Jump in that— (Ho, ho), jump in that—

Jump in that bitch, run in that bitch
Jump in that-jump in that bitch

[Verse: Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar]
Two trench coats in the bag
Baby Keem, king of rap
And I think he just came back
How the fuck did I go back? (pgLang)
Get your case off my back (pgLang)
That my son, wait, relax (It's the language)
Beat my son, go to your room (pgLang, pgLang)
Stop sneak-dissin', that ain't bool
Play both sides, huh
She love all my guys, huh

[Part III]

[Spoken Word: Unknown & Baby Keem]
As we grow up, we begin to identify with things (Bitch). Which means, identify means, we divide all sense of who we are from certain things. When you're identified with something that you are not, it always leads to suffering and unhappiness.

Hey
Yea, yeah

[Verse 1]
Seesaw, life goes up and down like a seesaw
Sheepdog, used to keep my boys together - sheepdog
Real talk, tell those giants I'm here with a slingshot
Hiphop, has never been the same, ever since, ever since I got
Here

Tiptop flow, all the knowledge in a bookshop
Wouldn't match up to my, wisdom
I'm no prince but I used to run this kingdom
It don't matter what y'all think though,...
Still when I start, Shit stops. Straight up
Never Chewbacca but these Hands Solo

Once the Star y'all wise men followеd
Still got the heart of Pharaoh
Used to bе your hero
Now I don't weigh no kilo to you
Ain't no open windows
Aba saa, e come so
Simba, King of the jungle
Who woulda thought s3 m3we Kanzo
But we move

[Chorus]
Used to be geng-geng but we move
Chop time no friend but we move
Used to be geng-geng, chop time no friend
But we move. Aba saa, Ofie mpo ni. But we move

Used to be geng-geng but we move
Chop time no friend but we move
Used to be geng-geng, chop time no friend
But we move. Aba saa, Ofie mpo ni, But we move

[Verse 2]
Got so furious
Felt so used but
Hallelujah
E pass your suliya - nutmeg
Y'all ain't ready for what next
I'm just, too blessed
Jah for claim in balance

Had to bend down to pick you up
Don't say you levitated, nah
You don't wanna make me size you up
And shake my head, Daabi da
Take me, leave me, love me, hate me
Nothing, changes, I still, believe in...
Me

Chop time no friend but we move
Used to be geng-geng, chop time no friend
But we move. Aba saa, Ofie mpo ni, But we move

[Intro: Josef Leimberg]
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
(Everybody get out)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat & George Clinton]
At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?

[Break: Dr. Dre]
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, "Fuck your haters"
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

[Outro: Anna Wise & Whitney Alford]
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Whoo Ha!
Backpack raps with gats in it
Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
K-Dot thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier, on point like a pyramid
A forced to be reckoned with, fuck with the best shit
Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
This is it, I'm in the lab cooking up all day
Fuck 'em up all day like a nympho
I been dope since S curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well there's chemicals there
I'm in the hood with the 17 year-olds that's on hood patrol
And they want stripes, so they shoot off bikes
And you know any moment you can lose your life
So kiss your kids and hug your wife, and what not yo
I spar with a dragon, he tried to throw a flame
But I ducked, then I stabbed him and came out the battle laughin'
That's a metaphor for any rapper who wants it
I smack 'em til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if I'm there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit the hotel
There's no assumptions
Cool out before I move out, hop on the 105
Do about 105 before your ass gets threw out the back seat
(There's a dead guy on the freeway)
Oh, It's not Dot? Tell the medics it's okay
A beast when the beat break
You probably think I'm dope like this the realest shit I wrote
But to me, it's a throw-away
I stare at the four walls and rap like I'm mad at God
Nice enough to throw a spear at Nas
Launch at Jay, matter fact, let me take that back
See I don't fuck with real legends in rap like you do
I'm crucial, concealed by real crips and suwoo
And they shoot like photography students when beef gets to brewing
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Come again, no introduction, you know my name
Soul brother, Dueces suck the juice from my ding-a-ling
Orangutan arms banging niggas like a set
When I speak, they fucking silent like sex for the deaf
Violence, I play it like violins in the orchestra
Treat you like vitamins then spit you back out
Like a verse I had way back before I had it mapped out
Rip a page out the Almanac then cross reference when I wreck shit
I wish jaw bone fractures on all of you rappers bumping your gums
Like the measles when the record meets the needle
Heads spinning like a twelve-inch, Smoking the best Celtic
Like I shot Larry Bird, follow my word
Big Herb, Ill with it, I need a hospital gown
You need 54 cards, deal with it
You may think I'm killing it, but I'm healing it
Like a bitch in the club, Shoe game
[Verse 3: Punch]
Ay yo yo, the flow potent
Who's more focused? Kick doors open
Deliver the golden opus leave with two guns smoking
It's me, the podium closing, a poet well-spoken
The gropes is most consistent with imminent penmanship
Mind-bending, co-existing with the written
Verbal assassin, Internally smashing, Spazzing on tracks
Translation, I'm disgusting in action
A lyrical glutton busting over Sounwave productions
Y'all don't want nothing, The sum of all fears
Mercury rising, I'm summer all year
I sixteen 'em to death and wish them the best
I guess that's the gift and a curse, You see my pattering
Y'all still rapping like that's what's happening
I write rhymes with fire on stone tablets
Peep the malice, I'm a monster
Ya Boy running like William Joseph Crawford touche

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Straight up, Don't get ate up
Put rappers in quicksand, Dot leaned on 'em like kickstands
I'm so hot, kids put me in their iPod
Even atheists play my shit and say, "My God, Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, he's nice"
Don't compare me to them, just compare me to Mike Jordan
When I record and the verse and the chorus is ill
You can land in lab of fortune when biting my skills, playa'
Watch I lay-up bar after bar like I'm trying to build a gate up
See me on the way up like an elevator, I'mma let you take the stairs
That metaphor meaning I'm already there (Greatness)
I'm in the booth with an apron
Cooking up shit like Martha Stewart was my bitch, Amen
Stay on the curb like a spray day tan?
Blowing herb with my nigga Herb, Fuck what you niggas heard
We the new West Coast Wu Tang bitch and I'm the best
Think less, You can suck my dick
Who from the West can kill it like us? Give me their name
Now I take 'em to the house of pain, Top Dawg headquarters

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them

[Intro: The Sylvers & Kendrick Lamar]
Pillars of joy can be found
Through the thought of you
I'll be troubled and bustled and scorned for your love
Canei Finch on the beat
Turn the headphones up, Ali
Here we go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up this morning with my dick on hard
Didn't know why 'til I said fuck all y'all
Or fuck this world, or I'mma fuck that girl
Good kid, m.A.A.d city, watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences
Fucking right, it's either that or life sentences
I'm relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up? I'm at your neck like a Pendleton
Nigga, I need that, bitch, I need that
Twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
They say he got smoke, like where the weed at?
And everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that
Pockets on Kelly Price back when it was '95
Buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
Give you dap and then we slide through your hood three dozen times
So what's good? I'm looking for a pedicure
Pink pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
Bomb-ass head 'til she can't blink
And her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me

[Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so damn turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I woke up this morning like fuck the world
Been hustling since I was twelve, man, I've been through hell
Now these motherfuckers is trying to tell me I don't care
Trying to tell y'all motherfuckers, look, y'all wasn't there
Turnt, posted up on the block, waiting for mail
From my niggas posted up in the county, praying for bail
Could've cost your boy everything, man, it wasn't cheap
Coming for a nigga, just don't sleep, shit for the weak
Got on my Malcolm X frames, now I count the check, mane
'Cause every time I speak, you hear my Malcolm X pain
Now them doors go up on that Lamb, they like judo
Young, you like your bitches with ass? I like you, hoe!
First, them bitches see me, I'm gone, I'm like Pluto
Plus, I keep them choppers that sing, they Mars Bruno
Brown bag full of cash, baby, MCM
When they ask me my name, I tell 'em MC him, straight up

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
All praise go to the most high
All fades turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets, after fucking with police guaranteed
Last nigga did that died, don't you, don't you, don't you
Wanna live where the AK go for only 8K
Minus six racks, minus one on top of that?
Melee, stomp him out then drug him out like a date rape
Daytonas bending every corner while they say

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
All I ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
And my teacher as my woman, when she smiled, I stick my tongue in
Plus some cartoons and some cereal, Snoop Doggy on my stereo
Some British Knights or LA Gears with glowing lights or Perry Ellis jacket
I would love a swapmeet full of Chevrolets in candy paint
That's wet with Tammy on the bumper, can I hump her? Poppa tell me yes
A DPGC concert and a DJ Quik song on cassette
Twenty years later: hi hater, I'm the fucking best

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, uh-huh
They don't do it how we do
Niggas ain’t on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm 'round the bullshit like a matador
I’m used to the bullshit, it don’t matter boy
Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion
That pussy make a weak nigga break down
So which you want, the cheese or the cheeks
You want the cheeks but she want the cheese, a bitch gotta eat
I’m havin’ the epiphany you niggas ain’t shit to me
Worse than the scum in the slum I’m from
I’m a Southside nigga, yeah I’m ‘bout mine
You be that next nigga coroners come outline
You ain’t made of what I’m made of
You a bum nigga with a bum bitch, her shoes come from Bakers
Counterfeit, fraudulent fakers
What kind of rich nigga bitch look like that?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We on now; we pullin’ off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling, down the top
Shine’s on stuntin’ and I’m pullin’ out a knot
Strapped with the Glock won’t pull it out a lot but front, I’ll make it pop
Y’all don’t do it how we do
Niggas ain’t on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)
We up, nigga!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Visualize everything I needed and dream (uh-huh)
Penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?)
Guns in your video get you locked in a bing
Yeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean
Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
Charity work, parking tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody
I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer
Debating on should I fuck her or jump on her single
20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib
I'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids, K-Dot

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We on now; we pullin’ off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling, down the top
Shine’s on stuntin’ and I’m pullin’ out a knot
Strapped with the Glock won’t pull it out a lot but front, I’ll make it pop
Y’all don’t do it how we do
Niggas ain’t on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)
We up, nigga!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Good pussy for dinner, bomb kush for breakfast
D colored VS stones around my neck bitch
It feels like a nigga dreamin’
Seat back, music bumpin’, niggas leanin’
Bulls eye, that’s what we came for
The bread, now a nigga run the game boy
I should’ve sent the broad to report what’s in the yard
Aloof livin’, I came up so hard
No pain, no gain, it’s embedded in the brain
I’m in it for the grip, motherfuck the fame

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We on now; we pullin’ off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling, down the top
Shine’s on stuntin’ and I’m pullin’ out a knot
Strapped with the Glock won’t pull it out a lot but front, I’ll make it pop
Y’all don’t do it how we do
Niggas ain’t on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)
We up, nigga!

[Verse 4: Kidd Kidd]
‘Round the world tourin’, the city got boring
Bury me a G with a new pair of Jordans
Coupe foreign, top peeled like an orange
Blue Ferrari, so many iron horses
Living life with no worries
My gun got a Zodiac sign, it's a Taurus
Don't make it slam on you like Amar'e
M-Zone Rida Gang end the story
Oops, that's your baby, my bad, I'm sorry
She call me daddy too, we should be on Maury
Everything you aren't, fly nigga soaring
Purple label Ralph Lauren, kick game like Atari
You so special, bedroom or restroom
Just keep performing, go girl
About to film a movie, guess who's starring



[Verse 1]
I've been known to flip on niggas, spaz on bitches
One state of mind, I'm out for the riches
I've seen good crack, uncle stuck in the kitchen
Now behind prison, phone calls can't visit
Seventeen, half of my life has been explicit
Rated R content, no supervision
With you talking nonsense, I'm not trynna listen
I'm a point guard, small forward, play your position
Before you wind up in the lake with the fishes
On a blind date with a crocodile, vicious
I switch the flow so you say that I sound different
But the flow is the same reason my dick kill bitch kissing??
And that's the same reason your not in my competition
Cause I swear right now that none of yall existing
Fall off is probably what you wishing
But I can't stop, won't stop, young gunning you niggas
I've been known to have stash for the burnnin
And break a bitch down to the point that I learn them
And when I get dough, I'mma let you know, throw the cake in your face like Ike Turner
I turn a schoolgirl into a dick smuggler, sex publisher, rated X government
See me in the hooptie boy, it's not a cover up
See I'm a young black boy who don't give a fuck, what
This that gangsta shit that make you wanna grab your shit
Cock back and blast some shit
Empty, reload the clip
You won't find nothing hotter than this
Whatcha know about it
This that gangsta shit that make you wanna blaze this spliff
Get drunk, grab a fifth, open it, guzzle it quick
You won't find nothing hotter than this
Whatcha know about it

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yo the boss is back
Off the strip with 10 horses
Town on his back, flawless rap
But check my motives its big checks in the check I wrote it
Hardcore kills raps, spin it back
One flick off the wrist and wahla it is Ab
So if you see the kid napping that don’t mean I took em
That mean the cemetery got to find a place to put em
I think you might have put your hands in the wrong pudding
Or your man ? fucking with the wrong hoodlum
I’m not Bum J but all it takes is one day
Or one hour of recess to lets the guns play
(what happen?) I had to let the gun spray in his direction
Like Raid to an insect, I'm infectin' em'
Straight letting em go like its 8 seconds to go

[Hook: Kendrick]
If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
Cause we don’t give a fuck about who you running’ with
We will flame yo shit and all you gonna hear is (what happen) yeah (what happen)
Oh nothing that boy was being himself
Like, sike, nah I’m bluffin’ that boy was somebody else
So we hurt that boy, hurt that boy

[Verse 2: Kendrick]
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
But a loud mouth get a entrée of bullets right to the head, shit
Bon appetite, I climb out my window I shoot ya block up then I’m back in the bed, sleep
Back to the business, backpack with blocks all in it
When it comes to beef I’m doing the dishes, shit
More beef then I’m stuck in the kitchen
To stop my trigger finger from itchin’ I’ll probably need a prescription
Plus, I told you niggas too many times, you're not in my division divide mathematician
Counting money like it grow on trees
Matter of fact it do, I got a lawn full of hundred dollar bills, no leaves
My bitch got a blade in her weave just incase mine break she hand one to me
Cataracts I know y’all can’t see I infact I apologize about that
[Hook: Kendrick]
If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
Cause we don’t give a fuck about who you running’ with
We will flame yo shit and all you gonna hear is (what happen) yeah (what happen)
Oh nothing that boy was being himself
Sike, sike, nah I’m bluffin’ that boy was somebody else
So we hurt that boy, hurt that boy

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I walk it how I live it
Call it how I see it
I don’t live by a script you wanna be whats on the TV
Yeah I’m Jay rock  I’m the one haters love to envy
So I keep burners, busting clips until they empty
Straight to his head til his skullcap is empty
And if I’m ? I’ll be back up in a jiffy with a semi
Smoke his ass fast like a Philly watch the automatic lean his ass back like a willy
I’m silly with the 9 millimeter shot to his bathing ape outfit
Put his flame out quick I’m bout G shit you you, ain’t bout spit
Sniper his ass watch his ass drop unexpected like bird shit
A general so you gotta salute the Colonel
Give you a warning Disobey you gone by the morning
The bullets come free with a casket see
But you broke so you can’t funeral with fear

[Hook: Kendrick]
If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
Cause we don’t give a fuck about who you running’ with
We will flame yo shit and all you gonna hear is (what happen) yeah (what happen)
Oh nothing that boy was being himself
Sike, sike, nah I’m bluffin’ that boy was somebody else
So we hurt that boy, hurt that boy

[Verse]
Livin' in my own world, I could never die
Ambition of a hundred kings livin' in the sky
Nothin' can stop me, no nothin' can stop me
My destiny tellin' me that God got me
Grace in my own greatness and I made this
Pandemonium and victory, I can taste it
Set me free, I wanna be set free
I wanna be remembered in my own legacy

[Hook]
We fight, we cry, we live, we die as kings
We multiply with gold, our hearts will bleed
You recognize this more than just my dream
Once you realize, you'll know what lies beneath
Know what lies beneath, know what lies beneath
Close your eyes and you'll realize you know what lies beneath

[Verse]
Nothin' can stop me, no nothin' can stop me
My destiny tellin' me that God got me
Came from darkness, I made it with sharpness
Back when I said that I tried my hardest
I will not lose, I paid my dues
I failed several times, I tied my shoes



[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me you love me
Know that it's real
I can see more
See how you feel
Look at my eyes
Do you realise
What is the truth
Your surprise
I despise, whatever's right
You're the wrong
This is my life
This is of you
This is of me
This is the truth
This is of we
This is for love
This here is God
This here is yours
This here is ours
Look at my eyes
Tell me you want me
Tell me you see me
I know you haunt me
I know you love me
I know the truth
I know the real
I'm speaking in you
I'm speaking in us
I'm speaking in we
I'm speaking in God
I'm speaking in free
You know who we be
You know that it's life
I know when you're wrong
I know when you're right
Just look in my eyes
I know your surprised
You tell me the truth
I know you despise
Ho!

[Bridge: Prince]
Take this mic, I can't sing
It only makes me wish for
The way things used to be
You can slap my face, PSH!
But I got to say it
You never would have drank my coffee
If I would have served you cream

[Chorus: Prince]
Tell me what's my name?
Tell me what's my name?
Tell me what's my name?
Tell me what's my, name? Oww!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me it's real
I know the truth
I know you feel
Look at my eyes
Do you despise?
What have I said?
You're surprised
My lies
We hide in lies
What is free?
What is God?
This is the truth
This is the earth
This is for you
This is for her
This is for me
This is for we
This is for us
You can see
You're surprised
I realize
What is the truth
So help me God
I know that it's real
Know you fulfill
What I do love
What I do feel
Looking at you
Looking at we
This is more
Than jewelry
This is your life
This is my life
Look at me once
Look at me twice
Say it again
Born to win
Living in God
Hoping it's the end
I....Ho! Ho! Ho!



[Intro]
Uh-huh, yeah
You know what it is
It's that Compton shit nigga
Get back

[Hook]
If I gotta ride
Then you's gonna die

[Verse]
I hope niggas ain't really tryin' to break my bones
Cause if you are make sure you know a nickname you want for that tombstone
Play hard as a rock bullets can break stones
Break bad boys down like Jenny did Sean Combs
I'm hot as an oven you just a pressin' comb
I'm not impressed homes you should've stayed home
And prayed that rooftop blocked you from gettin' shitted on
I gives a fuck if A&R's don't pick up the phone
I swear there's no one like me but if there is then I gotta long lost twin or they made me a clone
I don't care about friends I was made to be on my own
I came in this world by myself and I'm leavin' alone
Hopefully with a crib that I can call my own
With a backyard the size of the fuckin' Georgia Dome
Pop you popped shit and I might pop your dome
Give your homies a reason to make a memory song
Niggas swear that they love when the beef is on
Knowin' that plummet time the only time he'll roam
You better hold your breath I give you workin' death
And recommend the gun be your chaperone
I know young niggas that look up to Al Capone
And they look 17 but I swear that their mind is grown, shit
I'm so grown and the reason why I write this way
Pac and Big be ghostwritin' my songs
You can play the boss but if you get shot
From bein on top then homie that's your loss
I'm nice wit it
I'll pop your man then leave some money on him so it can pay for his funeral costs, get it?
The niggas tryin' to get money like Fort Knox
Either from the rap shit or back down to the cut rock
And you can play a baller but deep inside you know you just an actor
Yeah, somethin' like Rick Fox
You ain't a thug homie you just a fox
In the midst of werewolves somewhere in the boondocks
And I'm really from the streets
So if I ask for beef homeboy don't bring me no pork chop
I turn your skin to pork homie with one chop
With a rusty switchblade that's dirty like bum socks, heh
They say the flow is crack
So wherever I rap best believe you can call it a dope spot, bitch

[Hook]
I swear if I gotta ride (You know what it's)
Then you's gonna die

Dropped 40 for a Glock 40 that's a hood discount
That's an accessory gun, sesemy seed buns
For the beef y'all brung, y'all done fucked up
Fucked with the wrong fuck up
I've been a nut since pops fucked moms
Fucked up in the head, I'm living, but I'm brain-dead
Life goes on and you don't need a psychic in order to read my palm
Niggas'll get you first where I'm from
That's why I Creep on 'em, I creep on 'em, I creep on 'em
Niggas play cool, put the heat on 'em
Make the temperature reach the highest peak on 'em

I said you don't need a pyschic in order to read my palm[Chorus: Slim The Mobster]
Whose house is this? Money out the … can’t count that shit
Stacking death prez, mouth to mouth that shit
When they said a nigga wouldn't amount to shit
Now whose house is this? Laughing so hard my tongue is out and shit
Run you dick suckers, keep me out that bitch
Before I spazz and squirt and I’m out that...bitch

[Verse 1: Slim The Mobster]
Broadcasting live from south central Los Angeles
Where the babies born scandalous
The street I keep my hand in it
The gun I keep my hand on it
Niggas is going to need bandages
If I brandish it ambulances, the chance you make it slim nigga
I’m good in the hood cause I motivated them niggas
I graduated from dumb hoes and mault liquor
To expensive wine and dime bitches
Red lining the DB9 like it’s my time pimping
Audemar [?] quality time spending
And you niggas is borderline bitches
That’s my opinion
And my niggas is ride or die Aftermath my religion
Talk out but I don’t listen
Act out and come up missing
That click clack pow did it
Like Colin Powell did it
And I’m so west coast, ok corral with it
My new foreign car can't pronounce that shit
You fuck around…count that shit
[Chorus: Slim The Mobster]
Whose house is this? Money out the … can’t count that shit
Stacking death prez, mouth to mouth that shit
When they said a nigga wouldn't amount to shit
Now whose house is this? Laughing so hard my tongue is out and shit
Run you dick suckers, keep me out that bitch
Before I spazz and squirt and I’m out that...bitch

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Broadcasting live from Compton California where foreigners never come
Mothers are worrisome and we dislike the governor
I hope these angels can cover us
If the LAPD ain’t doing it then it was a cover up
Coroners about to cover up everybody
I’m serious, every shotty is saw'd off
And every nigga is militant
And your gut like...What?
EBT Cards, no credit can't ease cards
All my life beed OG aw now my life on the billboard soon
Give me room, I react like a wildebeest and
Throw salt inside your wound your just diabetes to me
Ain't shit sweet with these hotels homie
That crip shit got my uncle’s life in jail ho
So if I put the same line, they'll never forgive me
Or worse than that the niggas right around the corner might kill me
I’m fighting back when it’s hard what
No barber my guards up, the author of fallen fathers that did it without much, this my house nigga
[Chorus: Slim The Mobster]
Whose house is this? Money out the … can’t count that shit
Stacking death prez, mouth to mouth that shit

Run you dick suckers, keep me out that bitch
Before I spazz and squirt and I’m out that...bitch[Intro]
I welcome y'all to boot camp
Training Day
Fasten your seatbelts

[Verse]
Who shot ya, I don't know but you're best to call a doctor
Make sure them rookie medical surgeons can oper-rate on you
Pistol whip break the face on you, shit I does it my way like Sinatra
Let them infrared's Dalmatian dot ya
Scope'll spot ya, move wrong and I got ya
Through my vision like perennial
Creepin' to your house, you hear footsteps slowly as I tippy-toe
The tip I owe is through your window pane, I'm insane
One shot could leave 'em senseless, Marlon Wayans
Psychiatrist can't restrain the mind of a sick patient
Spray everything, not a single bullet wasted
Be patient, you gon' be meeting mad links
Put 'em in the basement
BET, I'm strapped with TNT
Follow rules every morning, this bitch coming with me, ooh
That's what they say when they see me in your coupe
Sunroof, rims spinning like a fucking hoola-hoop
You tried to play big and say "gimmie the loot"
Tables turned, now the people saying "please don't shoot"
Get out the way, label, and try to make it to safety
Cause I doubt that my shit is on safety
Spray niggas, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
Ride shotgun, 745 Maybe
That's Maybach for you dumb motherfuckers
I'm wise like my pops but I'm young, motherfucker
I'm the one, motherfucker, bust around hustlers
You want it? They could serve you, butler
Excuse me Ma, I ain't going for your lover
So when I fuck you, the same time I'm like "fuck you"
You're better off looking for your next sucker
Money talks, I thought you heard Chris Tucker
I ball as if I play for the Rucker
Black Widow, keep something under my pillow to buck ya
He talk about it and when the fifth touch ya, no confession, no Usher, for real
Your whole spot is a movie like Blockbuster
If I want you imma bring it to your block, busta
And make it clap, no I'm not spliff star and busta
In fact, my niggas is linemen the way they rush ya
I keep it street from Compton to Russia
Rhyme technique is something like none other
It's warfare, choke if you scared, go buy a flashlight and pray under your covers
I slaughter niggas, one hand bang, Vince Carter niggas
Young boy I'm a father figure to kids who's minds is bigger
And they pops still sprung off the hardest liquor, I'm young
Please move in orderly fashion
For the love of money and crime I got a passion
Blow your body and spine whenever I'm blastin'
Makeover your whole face, you look like a Jackson
Any one, pick one
[Outro]
Aye
I told you we gonna send you niggas to boot camp
Training Day
Fasten your seatbelts
The ride is rough
Lace your boots too
This is practice right here, we do this shit in our sleep
Yeah

[Chorus: Slim The Mobster]
Whose house is this? Money out the … can’t count that shit
Stacking death prez, mouth to mouth that shit
When they said a nigga wouldn't amount to shit
Now whose house is this? Laughing so hard my tongue is out and shit
Run you dick suckers, keep me out that bitch
Before I spazz and squirt and I’m out that...bitch

[Verse 1: Kanin]
Mama said, mama said, mama said
Boy you a star
Livin in a place with a bad mind state
Where a lot of good niggas don’t make it that far
Lot of good niggas didn’t lost they lives
These niggas didn’t lost they minds
For a piece of the pie
Everybody try to get rich fore they die
Uh, fuck any nigga tryna stop mines
Eject any nigga tryna waste time
Bitch you fuckin with a gifted mind
Eat these niggas like pork rinds
Fuck these hoes like one time
But bitch niggas ain’t one time
Seen this shit too many times
So I grab my balls, got on the grind
No I’m getting paid and livin life
Livin life in the winner circle
Cus I suffered much, suffered much
Cold world on color purple
Puffin on that color purple
Pockets green like Ninja Turtle
Turnt up when I’m off the herb
But jump through the hurdles when I use my verbals
Fuck you fake niggas talkin bout
Fuck these lame niggas lookin at?
I’m in a circle full of real niggas
And when I take this bitch you can’t have it back
It’s called hijack, hijack
TDE where the riders at
THC, we got pounds of that
Fuckin around in our circle, riders

[Chorus: Kanin]
We livin life in the winner circle
Ain’t no fake niggas allowed
We livin life in the winner circle
I’m gon make my mama proud
We livin life in the winner circle
Ain’t no fake niggas allowed
We livin life in the winner circle
I’m gon make my mama proud

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Life never did seem like it seen some life in me
Lights in the cloud that read, "Little nigga just use yo head you might can be
Just like Mike on the mic", Jordan
You’re recording more than twice a week
That’s not enough if you’re nice as thee Eminems
You mimic them legends but your work ethic is quite petite
Everything you like somehow retreat
From the page I’m so impatient
Pacin back and forth my sleeping pattern is getting badder than insomniacs
I’m a zombie at the studio, Can you ponder that?
I soon will blow like an arsonist
All I wanna do is be heard uh
All I ever do is strike nerves (Huh!)
A lot of fuck niggas and a lot of fuck bitches
That’s one thing that I observe (Uh!)
Cus when you doin you, everybody seem cool
Til you fuck around, get a blessing
And you look in the mirror, see the same old nigga
But everybody around you stressin'
I ain’t ask nobody for nothing
I went and got it my own nigga it’s nothin
And if you don’t condone or respect that
Then step back off my nuts nigga it’s fuck ya
I got a an appetite for more supper
And I lack advice for these suckers
And I sacrifice what I made, God bless my days while I’m in this circle
Ridin

[Chorus: Kanin]
We livin life in the winner circle
Ain’t no fake niggas allowed
We livin life in the winner circle
I’m gon make my mama proud
We livin life in the winner circle
Ain’t no fake niggas allowed
We livin life in the winner circle
I’m gon make my mama proud

On my chest is the letter C, poetically
So inclined, genuine, suspicious lies
Your bitch is mine and in due time
You'll see that I am certified and intertwined
Cover two like a cornerback
Yeah, loc' I need the corner back
I'm on it, I want it, I get it
LeBron with the Late Show, we get it
Imperialistic, magic mystic
Aaron Donald with the helmet lipstick
I don't lose, in case you missed it
Facts on facts, check my statistics
Don Dada, Doggfather
Drip on a bitch like cold water
Me and my niggas we known to cut up
Slice the bread, cut the butter
Pop the pain, roll the bud up
All of my niggas and bitches, what up?
All of my cousins crippin', throw it up
Wuh-wuh-win, nigga I ain't stutter

[Intro: Ab-Soul]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Watch how I kill them with the funky rhythm
Embalming fluid fill 'em
Piranha's in 'em
Peep my persona as I
Get deep as Nostradamus
You stalling? Like the '89 I-I-Isiah Thomas
I'm ballin', cut up your pajamas if you sleepin' on me
I promise no peekin' homie you tryin' to confiscate the flow, I know
So, I switch it quicker than my bitches in mini skirts that want your attention
One thing for sure, they gon' get it
I'm cursed with the world's negatives
Probably thinkin' I'm hurt but that's the only way I can live
More money, cash, drugs, got me feeling like Ace walking inside the club
Paid in Full, MOB license plates
38's slug hugging my waist like it had arms
Then I bear it so I guess it really does
No paper work on this marriage, but I'm in love with life corruptions rather than life (woah)

[Hook]
Oh, you ain't know? I need that
More money, more drugs I need that
More murder, more guns I need that, wondering how I live with the world's negatives

This the last days my nigga
We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Mamacita had a bangin' body
Drove a black beamer, present from her baby daddy probably
He knew the nigga from high school
10th grade? they was cool, fell out over a dice game
She knew that but still wanted him to penetrate through that
Shorty wait, me and your man go way back
She said so what? He don't need to know what go on between us besides, I just wanna fuck
She blew his mind
Know what? we can exchange digits
Lets hook up later pay one of them hotels a visit
She seemed more than interested, more like desperate to be intimate
Either she this polite or his lucky night
Got the champagne sittin' on ice
Room 112 fuckin' all night then interrupted by her baby daddy and some niggas that he fuck with
Got him for everything, pussy's a negative
Adam & Eve, he should've known

Oh you ain't know? you need that
More pussy, more hoes you need that
Even if it's dirty pussy you need that
Wondering how he lives with the world's negatives

This the last days my nigga
We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?
We livin' in hell waiting on heaven but you don't know so
Might as well try to accept it, go with the flow oh
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)
Seem's like we never see home, you know?
So we screaming
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Goes out to everybody that know about bad habits
And willing to accept them as a fatal attraction, what a reaction
Rolling with the punches that life gives us and end up like Ke$ha's
Liver cirrhosis, matches givin' us cancer
Bitches givin' us gono-rrhea
I promise to practice safe sex, momma, don't cry
They say the good die young but a crackhead live a long time
So I crack open a beer keg, take that bitch to the head
Sippin' it slow hopin' it prolongs my soul
And that's crazy yo
When heat is on, I put on a coat
Then take it off when it's about to get cold
I've adapted to my environment, murder environment
20 years worth of it so I gotta love it, you can't blame me
Negative energy, public pulled by evil string
As I open a bible I start to sing

[Ab-Soul]
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off momma forgive me
I can't be held accountable that negative's be gettin me down
Got me rolling with guys, making g's
Got me tellin' lies that sound true come test me

This the last days my nigga
We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?
We livin' in hell waiting on heaven but you don't know so
Might as well try to accept it, go with the flow oh
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)
Seem's like we never see home, you know?
So we screaming
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)

[Intro]
We got London on the track
Got my bae with me, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus]
If she don’t get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (I'm so happy)
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that

[Verse 1]
I know she livin' for a nigga, dyin' for a nigga
I whip that pussy with no ballers jumpin' out, lil' nigga
That pussy look just like a cut, a soakin' cut, lil' nigga (Woah)
Yeah, I'm a freak, you know I'm pullin' up to lush, lil' nigga (On Blood)
I'd never snooze to lose, I would never snooze to lose on you
Yeah, I'ma give you a couple bands, want some more boobs on you (Want some more)
Hey, I'ma sit back and pay attention like school on you
Yeah, I'ma shoot inside that pussy like a wholly on you
Goddamn, I'm sorry, B, I know you'd accepted my apology
I know that ass fat, apple bottom please
I need a deep throat baby, swallow me
I love it when you're around baby, follow me (Follow)
I only eat green, yeah, koala leaf
We shoot with big guns like a Call of D
She never say no, she ain't stallin' me
I kept my heart locked up in a safe, hey
You can't shoot with a pistol, need a K (Ha)
No, you can't see it, it is tragic by your face (Ooh)
But when it need air, let it out in a safe lil' place
I can see it on her face that if she don't get what she want
[Chorus]
When she don’t get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth
No these ain't no drugs, I know she worth
Yah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp (hey)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I broke her heart, now my heart hurt
I don't know why but I done cut down on that syrup
At least I got that lil' bitch ballin', she don't gotta work
Oh-no-no, she ain't had no job, but she having purses
Yeah-yeah-yeah, she know I'm the truth, places I'm in first
No-no-no, I don't want you bitches, y'all basic and thirsty (Y'all soft)
Yeah-yeah, she taught me well, it took some time, but it was worth it
She get on top and she ride it, Kentucky derby
You should see, I count that money like a nerd bitch
I'ma ball some with my dawgs but they ain't Courage
Her whole body same color, I call it perfect

[Chorus]
Since she don't get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (Yeah)
Looked up baby and say goodbye (Bobby Bruh)
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth
No, these ain't no drugs, I know she worth
Yah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Cap on, and I got racks on
Spend four nights in a country I like
Then take my rich ass back home
Glow so bright, I could make moonlight
See this ain't like your pheromones
Blew one, big gun, baritone
Who won? We won, yeah, holmes
We old school like Capitol
My old school made doctor note

Writer At WarKendrick Lamar in his own words.A lot of times in interviews, people ask me things like, “How does it feel now? What have you bought your mom and your pops and family?” Nobody ever really asks about what it’s like trying to adapt to fame and money and how much of a depression it can make for you. How much of a depression it could put you in knowing that so many kids hang on to your words. I can’t make a song like “i” without being in that dark place. “i” comes from going overseas, going to New York, being in L.A. and hearing kids saying, “Kendrick, I was gonna kill myself last week. Section.80, good kid, m.A.A.d city saved my life.” Or “I was gonna kill myself tonight until I came to your show.”

I believe that they are telling the truth. At first I wasn’t so sure, maybe it was just they were excited to meet me. But then they showed me their wrists and had all these different scars from when they tried to take their lives but failed. Or I look into their eyes and their pupils are dilated and they on all these types of meds and drugs, it’s a whole different story to me. That’s when I learned that while I’m making music for myself, drawing from my own experiences and conflictions and battles within myself, this teenager listens to every word I say. And that’s spooky

I think one of my biggest battles within myself is embracing leadership. You always grow up and you hate the term “role model.” You would say, “I don’t wanna be a role model. I don’t want none of that.” But in actuality, you are the biggest role model. It’s impossible to fight the title of role model. Especially when the type of music I make is so personal. People feel like they can relate to me or that they are me. They feel like they know my whole life story even though we from different worlds. So when I go out and meet them in public, I don’t get a response like, “Kendrick, will you sign this real quick?” Or, “I wanna just take this picture with you.” No, they want to have full conversations. I find out that they live their lives by my music and that right there is something[Kendrick Lamar's XXL Cover Story - Second Clip]When I try to soak it all in, that’s the only thing that kind’ve scare me, feel me? Life is sad in general and I’m meeting these different people every day. It kind’ve snaps me back into reality outside of what I do. Outside of the girls, outside of the cars, the money, it really ain’t that important when you meeting somebody that’s still in the struggle. These the people that live their lives in dark spaces, every day , you know, and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going, almost like a Bible, you know? These kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say, “Kendrick, I believe in you. I believe in your music.” And what happens it puts me in some type of space where it’s almost like some type of worship or responsibility, but I know it. I can see itAnything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret.I think one of my biggest assets is not knowing how famous I am. Or even excluding the word, I hate the word “famous.” I’m aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it’s really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others

I had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, “Try to completely throw away your ego.” How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It’s tough. It’s something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places—the big spots, all the events, the lights—it’s all for your ego. It’s all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I’m somebody. But truthfully, you’ve always been somebody. You don’t need the lights




I try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what’s ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I’m missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can’t get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things

It’s definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it’s not just me you’re focusing on now when I’m out in public, but also on individual characters that I’m talking about in my music. So that’s a whole other ballgame and it’s just something that I’ve gotta acceptWhen I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project.I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it’s more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom’s van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I’d never think that would happen, but it’s happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can’t drive that thing no more. And she’s old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn’t be able to handle the day-to-day. It’s a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it’s just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it

I’d be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, “This is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I’m finna put it to you in a whole album—from Compton, from the hood, from the streets—it’s a whole other perspective and light, I’ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and ’Pac did it. And I’ma tell my story.” Then I wrapped up with it and said, “Man, what’s on the radio right now? I don’t think they doin’ skits and things like that.” I don’t know if the people are gonna understand what I’m talkin’ about on this album because it’s almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain’t been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the masses, at least




My whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don’t know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn’t know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, “Man, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don’t know. Y’all sure I’m right?”

I was nervous because I didn’t think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it’s amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, “Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this.” This is his words verbatim, he said, “Watch what’s gonna happen.”I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I’ve always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn’t the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family

Because that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that’s all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn’t satisfied. I’m looking around like, this is great security, but I don’t even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that’s in need. But at the same time, I’m feeling like, okay, what’s after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, “Thank you.” And them being able to recite them lyricsKendrick Lamar - Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe ([Explicit)]I think the first time I played “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I’m creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, “Play some stuff .” I can’t say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I’m gonna be influenced and I don’t want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it’s really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It’s selfishness for sure, but it’s my selfishness and I own it
I know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret. That’s how I was feeling at the time and that’s how y’all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that’s how I look at itFrom 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper’s rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a fuckin’ barbarian. That’s all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper ’cause this is around the same time where cats weren’t putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn’t even signed to a major label. So by that time, that’s when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer’s point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that’s how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It’s the art of writingSo you ask yourself in the midnight hour, ‘Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?'This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I’m obsessed with it. And that’s how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I’m already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That’s for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that’s something that I hold dear

When I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn’t tamper with, I’ve already had done, that’s when I’m done and I know I’ve exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I’m drawn away from it, that’s when I say, okay, let’s take all these pieces—they might not even be songs—let’s take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear




It’s the best part because the things that I say on my records—this is another reason why I don’t just play records for people—you won’t necessarily get it until it’s constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I’m not an artist that’s gonna give you a single and say, “This is what my album’s gonna sound like, go sell it.” That’s not me. I’m just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that’s exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don’t want to jump in somebody else’s lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I’m inspired

What’s crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there’s lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don’t necessarily scare me. It’s almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: “Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now.”

Thank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back[Kendrick Lamar Covers XXL Magazine's Winter 2014 Issue]I thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn’t have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn’t really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you’re saying, “rap,” that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep

I found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It’s scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I’m in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like thatWhat I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, “Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?” It’s a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it’s something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don’t necessarily change, it’s usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don’t care about them or you don’t fuck with them no more when that’s not the case. You’re just more focused on what you have to do because it’s biggerThe moment I start seeing change in people around me, that’s when I know something is a little bit different. Then there’s tension in the air that I probably can’t necessarily deal with at the moment. ’Cause when the industry don’t understand me, and the business don’t understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can’t run to them?

Artists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I’m always paranoid. I’m already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you’re put into a space where you feel like you can’t necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day

The hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It’s almost like you go on the road and you’re gone for two years. And this place you’ve known your whole life, these people you’ve known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that’s one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don’t have control over your own life. Over your own well-being

What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I’ve seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I’m saying this right now to let everyone know, it’s real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity

Niggas couldn't see, let me part the sea
Part a part of me, nothing pardons me
You niggas arguably is worse than me
Get your whole squad, let me go hearse your team
Pop bullets in his back, make him work his knees
This is sick I'm on top now
I remember in the hood I was locked down Oakland, Yosemite
Having YA dreams appearing right ahead of me
Now I'm getting glad that you niggas ain't ahead of me
And you'll never be forgetting me
Hard drive, man, it's all about the memory
Strapped with a vest screaming "Motherfuck my enemies"
Uh, have 'em moving like a centipede
I'm the weed-man so you know I got the remedy
Plus I'm a user, dope-fiend music
Plus I'm a robber and I dare you suckas push me
Got the same pistol that they shooting—I'm too nice
I'm the rawest rapper, I'm done, I'm done
[Verse 4: Cyhi Da Prynce]
Nah, I ain't done no faking but here come the H-game
We were the shit before the cake came
I hate lames, they get mad because we make change
And I ain't even had to bake caine
But I keep the weight gain on the freight train
Fuck dope, I'm on the kush and the haze game
In the streets I got a great name
I'm a pimp cause I break dames
Play with my pay, I see my great danes
Pauls let the face bang, huh
Trapping was cool till the J came
Then they found a couple tools and the ye, damn
Then niggas change colors like a fake chain
Prince of the South, hoe, you won't catch me without Dro
I'm like T.I., pimping's in my genes, and ain't talking 'bout Levi's
I keep the kush and like the couch fold
And the toy like G.I. Joe
Bet a G I. blow
You pussy niggas wanna fight I outdoors
The devil stay right, Ali eat, ya'll close
Cause I'm swinging the three plus three-five O's
We got chickens nigga E-I-O
What you seeing off a pound nigga, we see off O's
Catch me in the 'Lac with three [?]
And I ain't fucking with you niggas 'cause I see y'all hoes
Cyhi, let's get it

I return before tables get turned
It’s my turn, spur of the moment
They re-produce my sperm and try to clone it, stand firm
Bumping The Firm, Phone Tap, I’m on it
I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
You can’t fuck with the horse power, your woofing too much
Y’all bout to hoarse coward, as soon as I buss, pause
You put your hands on a broad and telling me you can brawl
You thought you saw me when you saw Saw, frightening
More reckless than a paisa driving without a license
Hittin’ your new truck then leaving you hiking
They said no, the industry let it go
I cracked the window then hit the back door like trick dices
Stickin’ and movin and movin’ and stickin’ the prices
Uppin’ the ante before I'm a antique, can promise you hear me clear
Even if you eat 3 ears with Tyson
Rippin’ the panties but bootin’ the wammys
They dyke and I’m liking them all, I’m siftin’ through panties
Haters’ll spike it
Voicing opinions but holding laryngitis
But I don’t hear ‘em, I’m a winner by law
Track em down like the subway when they sub-par
Sub-zero everytime I jump in the synagogues
Send the angels, send the God
I can make you look hard, I know
I just let the thoughts take its toll
More sentences than level four of y’all, Bogard
Go hard, black tar, concrete, Tom Vick times Papi Mason times 3
Uncle Toms need Tums to stomach atomic bombs
Or die from my Wizardry
RZA, GZA, Method Man
I’m a killer B, killer! Be killed, make your embassy yield
This is not your cup of tea, and oh
They say waters run deep, dive in, Bermuda triangles
And you will see us, we must leave dust behind
Emcee’s duck, deduct, revenue declined
When we touch down like a Running Back’s grind
Can you keep up and keep us safe for keepsake
That ain't safe
Compton!

There's a new crew taking over hip-hop, and everybody's trying to be down.I try to stay in my own little bubble and not think about how people view me, 'cause if you do that, it's very quick that you can go crazy.Kendrick Lamar: That’s crazy.

XXL: What?

KL: TMZ.

XXL: How did you break into that world? You’re like a little backpack rapper, and then all of a sudden TMZ cares about what you’re doing.

KL: That world is The Matrix. I don’t understand that world—that’s The Matrix.

XXL: Is it really like they say, that it happens fast? Even though you’re moving real slow and then—

KL: Yeah, that’s very true. That’s very true. It definitely happens fast, but not fast in the sense, saying you didn’t put in the work—I’ve been doing this for ten years—but when that light beams on you, it happens fast from an aspect where you’re doing so much every day [that] you’re not really aware of the attention that you’re getting, ’cause you’re doing interviews, you do a show, then you do a studio, it’s just a constant, daily plan, so you can’t look at yourself. You can’t be in the crowd looking at yourself on stage, you know. I can only look in the mirror and know I’m Kendrick, and see that same little boy I seen seven years [ago], but I can’t see what everyone else sees. So more and more, I’m really unfazed by it as more and more success is hitting me and I’m not really sure [about it all]. It’s a tricky thing, for sure.

XXL: What’s your day-to-day been like for the past few months? Has it been mostly touring and interviews? Have you back in the studio? Do you write often? Where are you at, as an artist?

KL: I’ve been on the road for the most part. But at the same time I gotta stay creative, I gotta stay writing—I’m usually writing every day. I can’t miss a day without writing, whether it’s a line, a verse, or an idea. I always have to have that creative flow going.

XXL: When you say you write, what’s your writing process like? Are you writing or are you just thinking shit in your mind?

KL: The process for my first album, my debut album, and even music prior to that, it’s always been like 50/50. I have some songs where I just went in the booth and just got the thoughts off and I didn’t want to feel like I was confined with a sheet of paper. Some records, I may sit with it and have scraps of napkins everywhere, and papers everywhere scattered, then [I'm] piecing up them ideas together and putting them to songs. It really depends on what I’m feeling at the time.[Intro: Bēkon & Kid Capri]

Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks

Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
He'll make it (He'll make it)
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin'
Woah (Woah)
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!," X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (No mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him
Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back—

Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control

Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll aks again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

It's not a place

Of drum and bass

Keep the family close—get money, fuck bitches

Is your house big? Is your car nice?
Is your girl fine? Fuck her all night?
Is you well paid? Are your shows packed?
If your song played, would they know that?
How the thug life? How the love life?
How the workload? Is your buzz right?
Do the trap jump? Is the plug right?
Got your head right? Boy, yeah right

You're chasin'
Keep pretendin', make it real until every cell replaced, erased

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Pop 'til it's vacant
Pop 'til the wrist pop
Pop 'til he shakin'
Pop like four on the floor been in rotation
No allegation
Popular demand, I understand  my name is only for conversation
New York nigga be like "deadass"
L.A. nigga be like "on the dead homies"
I was off the porch like Fed-Ex
211, got bread on me
K-Dot twilight the zeitgeist
Roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp
Temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them
Just canary yellow gem, jumping out the fuckin' gym
Swang like new Dana Dane, I ride dirty
Paid like two Damon Wayans, retire early
Fade like shadows, the stallion, the cattle
A bitches decision for you, is narrow
Collision, the money, and fame, the pharaoh
The physic, the chemist, the lame
Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange
Compatible for riches with more to gain
I said, nigga, yeah right
I don't fair fight but I bear fight
Lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight
Hangin' on my last four kills for the highlights
My life, hiii life, high five, bye, bye

[Intro: Andy Samberg & Adam Levine]
YOLO, you only live once
The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy
It's not worth the risk
Yeah

[Chorus 1: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
Don't trust anyone
'Cause you only live once

[Verse 1: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy]
Uh, you only live once, that's the motto
So take a chill pill, ease off the throttle
Never go to loud clubs 'cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry when they can't hear
And stay the hell away from drugs 'cause they not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard like a beagle
'Cause you should never trust a bank, they've been known to fail
And never travel by car or bus, boat or by rail
And don't travel by plane, and don't travel at all
Build a bomb shelter basement with titanium walls
And wear titanium suits in case pianos fall on you
And never go to saunas 'cause they're crawlin' with piranhas
And never take the stairs 'cause they're often unsafe
You only live once, don't let it go to waste
[Chorus 2: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat till it's done
'Cause you only live once

[Verse 2: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy]
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids, 'cause their hair is filled with mad lice
There's no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So don't 1980-force any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: killing machines
Now, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straitjacket so you're safe from yourself

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%
Thirty year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings
And you'll retire with money in your account
Beast!
[Bridge: All]
YOLO, say no-no
Isolate yourself and just roll solo, be careful-o
You Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue

[Bridge: All]
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky

[Outro: Andy]
You oughta look out

Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle of Hennessy in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, babe, check it out, I'ma tell you what my mama had said, she like:

[Verse 1]
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name

[Bridge]
Askin' "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

[Verse 2]
And the world don't respect you
And the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

[Bridge]
Askin' "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie

(Pause)

[Verse 3]
What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi
Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
Bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
So loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

Look, this isn't entertainment (no), I ain't no entertainer (nope)
This is your education, learn not to be a hater
Moving up like elevators getting close to my destination
Hand this vest and I'll detonate em
Blow up something, that's stress relieving
I'm in a world where the money makers get the pleasures
So all the pretty girls will fuck you if you're spinning cheddar
I mean the pussy good, but I feel success is better
The best defense are friends who love you when they felt the pressure
Pressing up and they go compressed and now I'm part of their conversations
See my life as less complicated, they're contemplating my conversation
(?) my place don't waste my time cause I ain't done celebrating
I never thought it'd feel this good to say we finally made it

They see me going big, I'm making it

And I swear this shit feel like my birthday
Hub City my birthplace uh
You'd rather roll over than live in a blizzard, or die in an earthquake
This could be a catastrophe, no one got the audacity
To show blasphemy, to the god of rap, nigga I go back like an artifact
And I got my weight up, all is fat is brought to you by
Kendrick and the all-mighty eye, HiiiPower
And I tower, over y'all like I'm 12 feet tall, every hour
I'm real fast, supersonic
Brace yourself, orthodontics
Orthopedics, I collect, your bones, if I need it
Mars Venus, that's the planets, I go to when I wanna be organic
Earth place too fake ha touche
Unguarded every time you pump fake uh
Pump brakes uh, nah, never that can't (?) wait nah
I'm living by the G-code nah mean, killin' rappers 'til they break uh
None, of, y'all, ball, like, I, do, every time I slide through
My pimpin' just remind you that

They see me going big, I'm making it

You don't like, ohhh
[Verse 3: Melo KAN]
See I'm, staring at the world in my rear view trying to get a clear view heaven only knows what I've been through
Barely on my toes are a tissue, trying to get a hold of my world is an issue
Show my potential, know that I'm here to beat (?)
If you orderin' b, I'm comin' with speed to crush every dream and your (?) is true
They only really start to hatin' when they go against you
I'm easy to get at (twitter), I'm hard to get to
Life said "pick a number, any number to describe the feeling"
I'm selling four down, bout 15 hundred yeah

[Hook]
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do

[Intro]
Soundwave, I feel we, put together
Some of the most beautiful music my nigga
Real talk, feels so good
Let's get this money
I feel like rapping tonight people
Can I rap a little?
Don't be mad..

[Chorus]
Cuz I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward

[Verse 1]
Look, why I always feel that I'm hot?
Why I always feel I should drop another jewel
Like Martin on Blue Streak while you dudes get tattooed
With permanent scars, I'm always bullying y'all
I'm always righteous to think that life is what you make it
I'm always thinking of R&B bitches butt-naked
I'm always on point, like a snitch on the go
But I never snitch my car's the only thing I towed on
I'm always keeping it moving, middle finger up
Like I practice celibacy, I don't give a fuck
Just wait, I'm at they heads like a toupee yeah
It's like that, your cranium never survive titanium bars
Harder than my dick when the tip gets licked, quick
Run for cover like winter's here then listen here
K. Dot you'll never shake me loose
Like a tied knot off the goose, you mad at me too?

[Hook: Jay-Z & Kendrick Lamar]
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low (I can't front)
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
I can't front, I can't front sometimes I feel like..

[Verse 2]
Yo, why you always critiquing my shit
Why don't you hop on your own dick like Marilyn Manson
I'm dancing with 2 brains, so if I got shot in the head
I won't die I'll just lose more game, propane walking
You could sell my words at an auction for the right price
And be rich your whole life, straight up
I wanna see the world by 35 but for right now I'm Compton bound
Hit Rosecrans with a pocket full of dividends
Big truck speed through the light, run over civilians
Pimp cut bitch on my right, hat low like a stripper ass
When she hit the floor, doing my thing, why you complain?
Cause I'm young and I'm black and I rap like a nigga got a
Angel on his back, wait a minute I means business
You homosexual with it, I give you straight lyrics
Now that's an emcee, that's why you mad at me?

[Hook]
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward (Fuck Ya!)
Check me out..

[Verse 3]
What I write is a like a bomb device, press play
And you can die tonight
Shook ones don't exist whenever that K. Dot spit
Off the chain like fast pedaling while riding a bike
I gets my ride on, you ride too
But like Scion, now that's a damn shame
I'm hogging up both lanes
Play your part, styles like Kevin Hart
They're so plain
I'm choking while I'm smoking on this strongest hocus pocus
Chocking with Punch
He sarcastic laughing cause I said that I can freestyle better than Kurupt
Now that's a statement that hopefully I can back up
See Kurupt is a legend, that's where I get my shit from
Straight lab rat, spit it once run it back
Like a punt return, they tell me wait my turn
So that's what I'mma do, lay in the cut like a 2 shot Dillinger
Killing these niggas in high pursuit waddup

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Oakland and 2Pac
I move oak, you see, I'm nothin' like [inaudible]
Thinkin' they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lyin' to you, they tellin' a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record twenty-four hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff
Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all'd try ride me
I shoot and have you land between the sheets with the Isleys
We push the coupe like a [inaudible]
The helicopter's comin', realize there's nothin' behind us
Behind me, Your Honor
I fuck over these beats with no condom
This ain't rap, it's really a porno, rewind it back
[Inaudible], it's back to definin' a loss, correct, they don't obey
Y'all ain't nice, nigga, y'all just okay
Yeah, they're more than a little [inaudible]
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, modern-day Isaac Hayes
[Inaudible] equivalent to the theme song of your career
Study my craft, you ignorant
I do it without a pen and a pad, just inspiration
Somethin' y'all never had
If my pockets is somethin' you tryin' to grab
See, I pulled out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, old dudes, get out my way
Let the young boy come through, don't mention my age
Shit, I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowd in my space
Look, you're not in my atmosphere
You can act like you're here
But actually you ain't accurate fuckin' with this music biz
The industry like, 'Fuck it, let the music be his'
No theme park, I'm not tryin' to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here, jump in the water
Do we really fuck with President Carter?
My reply's that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the biddin' war poppin' like a auction
Five or ten labels like, 'What he hatin' for?'
Except the zeros and more
Remember havin' Aftermath sittin' on my door
Money in front of me, I couldn't open the door
[Verse 2]
I'm so far ahead of my time
I got people five years from now pressin' rewind
I'm hardly impressed with y'all
I hate rappers, where the true artists at?
If it ain't a good picture you draw, don't bring it to the architect
Often y'all arguin' about who got next
Claimin' y'all runnin' the game, niggas is barely walkin' yet
Hoppin' all over beats without going through trainin' camp
Try studyin' a few greats, then maybe you'll be where I'm at
Your songwritin' ain't great, your mixtapes' medioc'
You recycle the same quotes, you're not switchin' your flow
Your flow in the same place
Don't just [inaudible], expand
Try to be more creative, perhaps
My rap friends, I ain't sayin' that you wack, psych
Like a invoice, I'm just statin' the facts, right?
You'd have to count the metaphors I write
In fact, you've been a factor you've feared your whole life
No TV show, don't compare me with them
That's like Jaws versus Nemo, a gorilla to a chimp
A Jordan versus Kukoč
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino[Intro]
God feel me
God feel me
Ride low
Feel me
Feel me
Weezy-F where you at?

[Verse 1]
Look, A straight up Compton nigga til Im 6 feet
Like Iverson be
Ride and die for mines
Its just me
No side on mines
Because I don’t need niggas switching sides on mines
Childhood friends become enemies
Don’t pay’em no mind
Do your mind like they did Kennedy's
Closed casket
Ghetto boys world where we make the murder bracket
High shore taxes
High by the dead beat daddy’s and the mama’s who can smoke the rock the fastest
So he tote llamas middle finger to ya
I never fuck hoes with no condom
Not a high school graduate
Hustlin is where his passion is
Hit the blunt then passin it, hit the bottle then passin it
Hit the gas, hit the brake, hoppin out, blastin it
Where da cash, where da safe?
A robbery’s taking place
Give it to him willingly; he’s killing you anyway because it thrills him
You can almost see his adrenaline pumping
Hey young world we are the children
[Hook]
It’s a young boys world out here
We gotta dredge-it up and down these blocks you got to know
It’s a young boys world out here

[Verse 2]
I swear to god you gotta feel me
Look..standin on the corner with crack rocks and marijuana
Burner glue, dough and I’m duckin police
In California state penitentiary livin
Feelin like the whole fuckin world don’t love him
So fuck yall
Keep thuggin til the casket drops
Gangsta down to the socks
Wankstas betta beware tryin to be what you not
Just look at his position and the city he live in
Bang the hood like a head on car collision
Bang his tool like a mechanic up under the engine
Knocking on they doors telling neighbors mind they business
Cause 9s can finish off any eyewitness
Don’t call the lieutenant miss Parker he meant it
I’m the author of these delinquents that got you timid
See to you he’s a menace but to me these my niggas
I do this shit for my niggas locked up in that system
Jason head hold ya head
Jewel keep written sentences
Maybe these jail sentences nothing but a young boys demise
And a reminder every time you walk outside
[Hook]
Feel Me, feel Me
Real Talk, what's up

[Verse 3]
Look, my nigga just had a daughter
Only way to feed his daughter
Said he hustlin harder hope no charges get brought up
Tryin to stay out of gunplay so he see her tomorrow
Back inside the gunplay soon as his homies call him
For that mission again on they mission again
Pop another blue pill then feel relentless again
Waking up in cold sweats see the image again
Nightmares of his victims keep on visiting him
Plus his people keep telling him use your common sense
So he tell’em retaliation is commencing
That’s all they know as a Compton kid
Living only for the moment fuck a consequence
His accomplishments lies deep within
The black heart that hoes be hatin violence
Use violence as his defense so in his defense remain militant
I’m the voice of hell that we livin' in
So when the devil got they tongue, I be speakin' for them
Talk to me, [Hook] talk to me

I’m the voice of hell that we be livin
So when the devil got they tongue I be speakin for them
Yung boys
[Hook 2]
It’s a young boy's world out here
I said I'm out here baby I said I’m out here baby
If you livin in this life blessed one day at a time
It's your world young boy you can heal or destroy
Make it wrong or make it right
It's your world you decide
Said it's yours young boy
Said it's yours young boy
Oh oh oh hey hey yaya baby yaya baby[Intro: Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock & Ab-Soul]
(Tha Biz—Tha Bizness)
Let 'em die
Dead
Black Hippy
We don't give a fuck
Hell nah, nigga
This conglomerate so cool, Rock, we could freeze L.A., nigga
Black Hippy
Move in
Kendrick Lamar
I tell 'em like this

[Verse 1-1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ring the alarm or wake to a bomb
You ain't a rapper, you Elton John, holding your john
I got a ton of croutons in the Louis Vuitton
That's big bread, the chickens are flying, flocks when I come

[Verse 1-2: Schoolboy Q]
Paul and Masson, half-drunk, stuck in a poem
Light matches underwater while I'm bracing the storm
I'm cool and I'm calm, laid-back, smoking a farm
Socking the shit out of niggas 'til I'm breaking my arm

[Verse 1-3: Jay Rock]
Up in my zone, two blunts, cup of Patrón
.45 on me, shoot you if you fuck with me wrong
No homo, pause, that's your life and it's going flatline
If you don't put your life in the song
[Verse 1-4: Ab-Soul]
I never drove a fast car, I almost ran over Tracy Chapman
She said, "Drive slow"; I said, "Fuck off"
Ab-Soul—what's up, y'all? Other than you're subpar
Above all? I'm a Heaven gate—above all, fucking great

[Hook: Ab-Soul, Schoolboy Q, Kendrick Lamar, & Jay Rock]
And every time we in the stu'
We cook that, chop that, what's that? That's crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
Oww, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we...
Cook that, chop that, what's that, that's crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch!

[Verse 2-1: Jay Rock]
The Black Hippys, the bag full, the bag empty
Spent it all at the car lot, then crash quickly
I'm trying to come with enough power to pass Fifty
I'm talking fifty bills—you niggas don't fit the bill

[Verse 2-2: Kendrick Lamar]
You niggas don't keep it real, you fake as Pamela's titties
I pound kitties, then hit the club with dogs with me
Tan Polos, no socks, chopped Dickies
Tan coupe, no top, bumping Biggie
[Verse 2-3: Schoolboy Q]
Blowing sticky, before the group, been a hippy
Nifty-fifty, all blue, real Crippy
Big money, long stocks, ask Pippy
Mask on, one sock, I gets busy

[Verse 2-4: Ab-Soul]
I smoke Blacks, relax, and watch Walt Disney
Puff squares, pace in circles until I'm dizzy
Speaking of Disney, fantasies, I had many
I used to hate on Mickey Mouse 'cause he had Minnie

[Hook: Ab-Soul, Schoolboy Q, Kendrick Lamar, & Jay Rock]
Anyway, every time we in the stu'
We cook that, chop that, what's that? That's crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
Oww, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we...
Cook that, chop that, what's that? That's crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch!

[Verse 3-1: Schoolboy Q]
Ahhh, napped through my final, made enough, richer than Lionel
Fucking bitches on my job, coming harder than rhino
Breaking their spinal, laid-back, bumping my vinyl
Navigation on the scopes, easy to find 'em...
[Verse 3-2: Jay Rock]
... Find you and I'm right behind you, laid back, puffing a blunt
Gat on my lap, constantly talking shit; I'ma dump
Your homies acting charged up, they can still get jumped
Take your chain, ash the kush for all you punks...

[Verse 3-3: Kendrick Lamar]
... However you want, whenever you want, you all can get it
Contagious, it's mad syphilis, blazing, it's God-giftedness
Die over death sentences, flow hot, plus, the beat knock
Like Jay witnesses, tell 'em I killed the witnesses...

[Verse 3-4: Ab-Soul & Schoolboy Q]
... Gifted as twenty Christmases, itching to blow
Like twenty bitches with mouths that need a dick in it, wow
I ran rap for half a mile, then got tired
Laid down and realized that I was lying (You fucking crazy, man!)

[Hook: Ab-Soul, Schoolboy Q, Kendrick Lamar, & Jay Rock]
And every time we in the stu'
We cook that, chop that, what's that? That's crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-1-0 shit, 3-2-3, bitch
Oww, nigga, welcome to the zoo, where we...
Cook that, chop that, what's that, that's crack
Yeah, homie, this is what we do
3-2-3 shit, 3-1-0, bitch!

Пох фристайл, бля
Йе, йе!

На мне свитшот Desaster Web
Ведь я крутой

Я ебал тебя в рот потому что ты не панк
И я реальный панк, а..
Мне похуй на алкоголь, потому я пью молоко
Ты ебаный долбаеб!
Иди нахуй, сука! (Йе)
Иди нахуй, сука, а
Я обожаю бошки
Еб Марию Кошкину
Ведь я, сука блять, мкиджей
А ты нет
Потому что ты не крутой нихуя
Иди-ка ты сука на три хуя-я-я
Свитшот Desaster Web на мне, ведь я крутой
Я ору панки хой, блять, хой, хой
Иди соси мой хой
Ведь ты блять говнооо ебаааа сука бля

[Chorus: MKG]
Аааааааддпдададда
Ву-ву
Ахххахавоувууву
Извините блять за мамбл

[Verse 2: MKG]
Я кидаю снюс, ведь я люблю снюс
Посмотрел ньюс, там несут хуйню, блять, опять
Заебали эти пидарасы по телеку
Посмотрю ютуб и там..
Там тоже хуйню несут, но там хотя бы ржачно
Иди нахуй, блять, жвачка, йоу)
АХАХ

Я ебал тебя в рот, иди нахуй
Потому что ты урод, ПА!

[Chorus 2: MKG]

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours. АААААААААААААААААААААААААА

[Verse] 1 Ekzzzz
Каждое утро, когда я встаю, я знаю зачем мне дальше идти
Много всего старается сбить, но мне не свернуть с нужного пути
Много лживых друзей, много шлюх хотят часть меня оторвать
И каждый раз их ожидает провал
Сила ведь в правде – и это факт

[Bridge] СД & Ekzzz
И что бы ни случилось – похуй
Что бы ни случилось дальше
Что бы ни случилось, знаешь
Время идет, и мы стали старше

[Verse] 2 Ekzzzz
Москва не верит слезам, но Jack Daniels скучные будни разбавит
В конце обернешься, посмотришь на труд свой – гордость за то, что сделали сами
Большая скорость, громкая музыка – это точно про нас, да
Ногинск это точка «А» в точку «Б» - Соколиная гора, брат
Планы – вперед, к вершине мира, и бить по тормозам не резон
Большая жизнь, большие цели и первый заработанный миллион

[Hook]
СД
Родной город даст мне силы – себя чувствую как босс
Много километров впереди ,проедем – не вопрос
В Питере родных и близких много, как и в Новосибе
Но Москва со мной всегда. Москва – тебе спасибо
СД & Ekzzz
И что бы ни случилось – похуй
Что бы ни случилось дальше
Что бы ни случилось, знаешь
Время идет, и мы стали старше
Что бы ни случилось, пережить помогут нам всегда верные друзья и Москва
Люблю тебя, Москва

[Verse] 3
Я слишком часто ошибался в людях, потом больно из-за этого очень
И нет гарантий, что это в последний раз – подъебут еще, хочешь не хочешь
Но то, что дальше будет, точно стоит прогулки босиком по раскаленным углям
Зови меня Кларк Кент, я чуть выше этого. Быть Суперменом чертовски трудно
Я найду свою Лоис Лейн в толпе из Вавилонских блудниц
Моя жизнь – только подъем к вершине, и больше никто меня не тянет вниз
Были моменты когда уставал, опускал руки, но отдыхать больше нельзя
Сейчас я многим лучше, чем был. Осознать это мне помогли друзья
Для сотен MC, как кость в горле. На фоне меня они девочки, тупо
Я знаю, что каждый из них, даже тот, что респекты кидает, хочет, чтоб я был трупом
Но sorry, зай, до жопы дел. Пусть эти девочки плачут дальше
Москва поддержит, но если хочешь замеса со мной – оставь надежду
Уже не будет как прежде, каждый, кто будет против – будет повержен
Раньше я будто во сне жил, однажды проснулся - нашел в себе титановый стержень
Passo per Passo , verso del sogno – и только так, без вопросов
Как бы ни было сложно - nessun rimpianto, nessun rimorso
[Hook]
