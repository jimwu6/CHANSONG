[Intro: Jay Z]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with mebitch
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyonce]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)


[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermes Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyonce]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)


[Verse 3: Beyonce (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That's right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyonce]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 1]
If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know 1+1 equals 2
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through

[Chorus 1]
'Cause baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby, make love to me

[Post-Chorus 1]
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Right now, baby, make love to me
We, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me

[Verse 2]
Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I
I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die, but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you, hey
I don't know much about fighting, but I
I know I will fight for you, hey
Just when I ball up my fist, I realize
I'm laying right next to you


[Chorus 2]
Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us
Ooh, make love to me

[Post-Chorus 2]
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, oh, make love to me, me, me, me, me

Heard they feelings 'bout you, baby, tell them hoes I wish 'em luck
Talkin' relationship goals, this could be us, yuh

But I know you in the worst way

Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy (Oh no)

Stacking her paper, stacking her cake up

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyonce]
Cash, hit deposit, 24-carat faucets
Louis V and Goyard trunks all in the closet
Ain't shit change, the streets is still watchin'
And my little baby Blue is like, "Who gon' stop us, huh?"
Ain't no way to stop this love
Ain't no space if everything is love
I'm representin' for the hustlers all across the world (still)
Still dippin' in my low-lows, girl! (still)
I put it down for the 713
And we still got love for the streets (oww!)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
We played it cool at the pool of the Cancun, VMA
Confidence you exude make the fools stay away
Me, I played my room, let the fools have they say
Fate had me sittin' next to you on the plane
And I knew straight away, uh
The next time we would speak was like two years away
You had a man, you shut it down until you two had a break
I bet that dude rued the day
You kept me up on the phone while you were away
You came back, I let you set the date
Nobu on the plate
I brought my dude to play it cool, my first foolish mistake, aye

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyonce]
Cash, hit deposit, 24-carat faucets
Louis V and Goyard trunks all in the closet

Ain't no space if everything is love
I'm representin' for the hustlers all across the world (still)
Still dippin' in my low-lows, girl! (still)
I put it down for the 713
And we still got love for the streets (oww!)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I never knew a lo-, lo-, lo-, love like this
Gotta be special for me to write this
Queen, I ain't mean no disrespect
But the way I net work, it's hard for me to connect
My first time in the ocean went exactly as you'd expect
Meanwhile you goin' hard, jumpin' off the top deck
A leap of faith, I knew I was up next
I never told you, but I told a few people we wed
Me, I'm off to Rome, you goin' back home instead
My first time in my life a live nigga felt dead
You came back, I had to act like it was cool in my head
Thoughts of jumpin' the broom, a player never been swept

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyonce]
Cash, hit deposit, 24-carat faucets
Louis V and Goyard trunks all in the closet
Ain't shit change, the streets is still watchin'

I'm representin' for the hustlers all across the world (still)
Still dippin' in my low-lows, girl! (still)
I put it down for the 713
And we still got love for the streets (oww!)

[Outro: JAY-Z]
To all the good girls that love hustlers
To the mothers that put up with us
To all the babies that suffered 'cause us
We only know love because of ya
America's a motherfucka to us, lock us up, shoot us
Shoot our self-esteem down, we don't deserve true love
Black queen, you rescued us, you rescued us, rescued us

Yeah, why you gotta act like that? Yeah
Just keep it real, yeah
Just say how you feel, yeah
Why you gotta act like that? Yeah
I'm the reason why your ass is fat, yeah
I paid that bag for that


[Verse]
Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it's to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Frosty the snowman was a merry happy soul
With a smokey pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year
Holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Here comes Santa Claus!
Here comes Santa Claus!

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Here I am
Looking in the mirror
An open face, the pain erased
Now the sky is clearer
I can see the sun

Now that all is, all is said and done, oh

[Verse 2: Marc Nelson]
There you are
Always strong when I need you
You let me give
And now I live, fearless and protected
With the one I will love
After all is, all is said and done

[Verse 3: Beyonce & Marc Nelson]
I once believed that hearts were made to bleed
Inside I once believed that hearts were made to bleed, oh baby
But now I'm not afraid to say
I need you, I need you so stay with me
These precious precious hours yeah
Greet each dawn in open arms
And dream, into tomorrow



[Chorus: Beyonce & Marc Nelson]
Where there's only love
After all is, all is said and done
Yeah baby Oh baby
Inside I once believed, that hearts were meant to bleed

[Post-Chorus: Beyonce & Marc Nelson]
I'll never
I'll never be afraid to say
I need you, I need you, so here
So here we are in the still of this moment
Fear is gone, hope lives on

[Outro: Beyonce & Marc Nelson]
We found our happy ending
For there's only love only love
And this sweet, sweet love
After all is, all is said and done
Yeah baby after all is all is
All is said and done

I heard
Church bells ringing
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring

Oooh, oh

I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart

All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry


And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending

Ooh

All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry



[Verse 1]
I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Verse 2]
Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Bridge]
They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Intro]
Aha aha this is for my fans
Aha aha this is for my destiny
Aha aha this is for my fans
Aha aha this is for my future man
Aha aha this is for my best-friend
Aha aha this is for my future children
Aha aha this is for my mother
Aha aha this is for my

[Verse 1]
You are my best friend
And I love you
You're always there to love me
When I didn't even love my self
You bring out the best in me
And I thank you
Thank you for my life, thanks for your advice
Your wisdom and your strength oh

[Chorus]
My earth angel
Thank you I'm so great full
For trusting me and loving me
If you love unconditionally
My earth angel
Thank you I'm so great full
For trusting me and loving me
If you love unconditionally

[Verse 2]
You are my messenger
From heaven
No matter how unhappy I become
You always find a way to make me smile
And I admire you
For your pure heart
You always giving all of you
To everyone around you
And I pray we never part

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And if it wasn't for you
And if I didn't know you
And if you never reach me
And if you didn't teach me
I wouldn't be who I am right now
I wouldn't give what I give right now
I wouldn't think what I think right now
I'm thanking you, I'm thanking you, oh

[Chorus][2x]




If this what you truly want
I can [?] her skin over mine
Her hair over mine
Her hands as gloves
Her teeth as confetti


So what are you gonna say at my funeral, now that you've killed me? Here lies the body of the love of my life, whose heart I broke without a gun to my head. Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead. Rest in peace, my true love, who I took for granted. Most bomb p*ssy who, because of me, sleep evaded. Her shroud is loneliness. Her god was listening. Her heaven will be a love without betrayal. Ashes to ashes, dust to side chicks.

TO MY DEAREST FANS in ANTWERP

I've never postponed a show in my life
It was very hard for me
I promise I will make it up very soon
I'm sorry if I disappointed you

Thank you for your concern
I'm feeling much better now
And I'm ready to give you a great show

See you tonight

All my love
Beyonce


[Intro: Kelly, Beyonce, and Michelle]
Beyonce! What?
Michelle! What?
Look! Where?
Hold up, don't turn your head
Just slowly turn your head, just
Oh, yeah, oh, yes, ha, oh
Right?
Girl, he's fine, he's definitely fine!
Ooh, hahaha, that's right
Hahaha, that's right, yup, haha
Exactly, fine

[Verse 1]
He walks in the club with love in his eyes
As he steps, flock-flockin' females by his side
Lookin' scrumptious, even though he ain't tryin'
The finest thang that you ever did see
The sexy creation, had his hat tilted to the side
Starin' at me, had my nostrils open wide
Can't even vocalize what I visualized
And my body paralyzed as he smiled at me, I said
"Hey, boy, would you enjoy sittin' next to me in your corduroys?
I'm from Texas, my girl is from Illinois
Where you from, can I come visit you sometimes?
My, oh, my, you seem like husband material
Caught in your cheerial, are you married?
'Cause you're very, very extraordinary, kinda scary
I want your name added to my vocabulary"


[Chorus]
Lullaby love, where have you been all of my life?
You chocolate-covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode
Lullaby love, where have you been all of my life?
You chocolate covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode

[Verse 2]
Tell me your dreams and aspirations
What's your future plans, what's your motivations?
Boy, I'm lovin' how you so unpredictable, but I am feelin' you
Guess I gotta get wit'chu
Admirin', you're my Jacob git
As I stare, say a prayer
"You available?", so sensual
Lullaby-love-heartbreakable, so special
Baby-makeable

[Chorus]
Lullaby love, where have you been all of my life?
You chocolate-covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode
Lullaby love, where have you been all of my life?
You chocolate covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode

[Bridge: Kelly (All)]
It's all in the way you look at me (apple pie a la mode)
I'm sure I'll enjoy your company (apple pie a la mode)
You're turning me on with your modesty (apple pie a la mode)
You have such a beautiful personality (apple pie a la mode)


[Chorus]
Lullaby love, where have you been all of my life?
You chocolate-covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode
Lullaby love, where have you been all of my life?
(You're so scrumptious boy haha)
You chocolate covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode

Lullaby love, where have you been all of my life?
You chocolate-covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode
Lullaby love, where have you been all of my life?
You chocolate covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode

[Intro]

[Chorus]
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song (Oh, yeah, yeah)
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known (Oh, yeah)
When you smiled, you smiled (Oh)
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last

[Outro]

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last



[String instruments play]

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
Oh!


[Intro: Anderson Paak]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohhh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Anderson Paak]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All that noise I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard you gon' get now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
At least these things I know (Yeah)
At least these things I know (Yeah)
At least these things I know (Yeah)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, man, one thing I know 'bout me is me (I know it)
I'm already knowin' and you might think that I'm already going
Looking at your phone, you see me call, you ignore it
Make me wanna call another whore up
My pimp kicking in, too high for this shit
Aye, man, them games you be playing, too fly for this shit
I die for this shit
And you don't really know that's what you got, do you?
And you don't really see the mirror once you got, do you?
See, you should never take advice from a person when they ain't gon' be affected by the outcome
And when you're looking at the life of a person
When you get a 100 million when you like such a person
If it was Sodom and Gomorrah would you look back?
If it was just me, you, the kids and the book bag
Especially if I told ya ass not to look back
Tomorrow brighter than the past, hate to see you turn to ash
Shawty, I don't play nothin', you've been A1, you my day one
You can't say shit, attention pay none to their opinion 'cause they be on
All that fake shit, I go take shit to the extreme
Fuss and fought 'bout, shit I thought 'bout
You and whoever it ain't shit to talk 'bout (Bitch)
Call you a bitch, then you just walk out


[Chorus: Anderson Paak & T.I.]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All that noise I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard are you gon' get now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I don't deserve you, lucky to have you
I hate to see you just walk away
Well, I know that it ain't gon' be
Cool with the game, you playing on me
So no more back and forth about this and that
No more tit for tat, what bitch is that? What nigga called?
You let a nosey broad get all in your head, well, fuck both of y'all
Ah, it's solid as it get now
And said if I were where you at
Well, tell me why every time I turn around
It look like you packing your shit and you're going on
But, shawty, going on, call her and she ain't got her phone on
Enjoy, hope you love that nigga
A sucker? Sorry, I never was that nigga
Now I'ma have to tag me a hoe or two
Pour up a pint to get my mind off the thought of you
Man, I'm just playin', you my mind, all I want you
And slow down, lil' mama, where you walking to?


[Chorus: Anderson Paak & T.I.]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All that noise I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard are you gon' get now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me

[Verse 3: Anderson Paak]
Promise when I make my first mill', we can still take a train to the steakhouse
And promise when I get you this Chanel, you'll pawn that shit if I don't make bail
I know that I ain't that only one that believes
That when the money longer than a Grey Hound
Every body wanna see
But when it's time to gas that bitch, you niggas can't pay now
A hundred G's would get you thirty even
You always eatin' take-out
Told your ass to get a couple drinks, ohh, you order champagne now
Grand Marnier, now
Oh, you shopping everyday, now
Closet looking like a Louis V playground
Walking out the front door in the goddamn shoes I pay for
Damn, and I'm the one to blame now
Banana peel the whole bank account
I'm living with a ape now
She only want the cake now
Selfies, all you take, now
I'm selfish if I break now
I'm begging you to stay around 'cause you're


[Chorus: Anderson Paak & T.I.]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All that noise I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard are you gon' get, now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me

[Outro: Dave Chappelle]
Nothing feels better than fighting and winning

[Verse 1]
She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
There for the grace of God go, I

[Chorus]
I found Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

[Verse 2]
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

[Chorus]
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria

[Bridge]
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands, baby, you got to understand


[Chorus]
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria

And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

[Verse 2]
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

[Chorus]
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Do you think
You could fall for a woman like me
'Cause I find it hard to trust
I need too much
And I really don't believe in love, no no
Do you think
That I could be the girl of your dreams
Sometimes I don't let things go
Get emotional
And sometimes I'm just out of control

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You need to stop for a minute
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Too deep)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me


[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Do you think
That I could be the one that you seek
'Cause baby I'm one step ahead
You're two steps behind
But baby I don't mind
Do you think
That I can make you real happy baby
Just don't get me wrong
My loving is so strong
But I ain't tryna lead you on

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You need to stop for a minute
(No no)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(No no)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
(Seems)
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(Without it)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Oh


[Chorus: Beyonce]
You need to stop for a minute
(Stop for a minute)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Before you get too deep up in it)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
You need to think about it
(Think about it, baby)
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No, no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman

{Outro: Beyonce}
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
Oh-oh, and you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

[Chorus: Andre 3000]
We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back to
You go back to

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I, I love you much
It's not enough
I love blowing, you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

[Chorus: Beyonce]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to black



[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bed
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry - get on without your guy

And I, I, I went back to a anew
So far removed from all we've been through
Oh-oh-oh, and you and you and you
You tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I'd go back to her
And you go back to...
You go back to...

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I, I love you much - it's not enough
I love blowing you lovepuff
And life is like a pipe

You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...
I go back to black

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Verse 1]
Everybody know that face
Even with her head low, they still know that shape
When she come through the club, people take they place
Chicks throwin' handcuffs 'cause they knowin' that they man ain't safe

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If it's four door, two gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin' like, please, get low

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Verse 2]
Everybody can't do this
Some ain't gotta clue till they hear me spit
Achoo, I spew 'cause yo' girl is sick
Is it the change or the hips--you can't tell, but you know it's thick

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If it's four door, two gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin' like, please, get low

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Bridge]
For this type of girl it's not that hard
You see her 'cause she too far gone
Though they pray and pray for her downfall
Why they gotta be so envious?
Doin' what it do fit to be a plus
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Back up, back up

[Chorus]
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Back it up now
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
How many times are you gonna apologize about the same thing?
And how many times can I take you back
When I'm not the one that's doing wrong?
I thought maybe if I started praying that we would get better
But when I would pray the answer would always come back to me bein' done
But we are so hard headed when we're in love
So I

[Chorus]
I told myself that I would make some changes
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

[Verse 2]
I'm totally out of my element
Learning new ways to live, while you're in a comfort zone
Not even thinking to call me
When I get mad you buy me gifts
Thinking it's gonna solve every issue
From the girl callin' my phone
To the pictures that I saw
And every time you would break up with me for nothing at all
I've taken all I could take
But the way I live has gotta change

[Chorus]
I told myself that I would make some changes
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

[Bridge]
Let me break it down
Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you was just to blind to see past
All of the pain they was causing you?
Ladies, do you feel me?
Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you went against the right things that you should do?
Then it's time to make a change
So I

[Chorus]
I told myself that I would make some changes
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more


Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance
You need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures
From the crawling ant to the leaping antelope
We're all connected in the great circle of life

[Pre-Hook: Third Ward Trill]
My mothafucker is a billionaire mothafucker, you heard that shit
I said my mothafucka is a billionaire mothafucker

[Chorus]
Let's work
D-boy drug dealer look
Billionaire
D-boy drug dealer look
Billionaire nigga!
From the coca leafs to the farmers
To the polo fleece to the bombers
R.I.P. to Gianni
Now we on our way
D-boy drug dealer look
Billionaire

[Verse 1: Nas]
Bally shoes, Gucci sneakers
Pharrell's a pharaoh, peep the features
Unlaced Adidas
Top of the world like pyramids in Giza
Fila sweats, 88 I rocked a mock neck
Carried a nine in my projects
Bucket hat EPMD cassettes
Now I'm smoking loud in Ibiza
Mix the D'USSE with the reefer
My whole life is leisure
Gangsta lean like the Pisa
Eiffel Tower, Hermes towel
The Feds is perched like an owl
Real niggas all feel the hook


[Chorus]
Let's work
D-boy drug dealer look
Billionaire
D-boy drug dealer look
Billionaire nigga!
From the coca leafs to the farmers

Billionaire

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
What you know about going out, head west
Maybach, 3 TV's all up in the headrest
Mace niggas at Madison Square Garden
20 million sold and we still catching charges
Rope chains, Rakim and Eric B
Bought my sidekicks Suzuki Jeeps and Cherokees
Hoop earrings, coupes with the rear cameras
Put that bitch in a cherry M3
I'm not your average dope dealer
Silver Toyotas four runners and four wheelers
Me and Teflon Q45 infinite
Windows tinted, white girl all in it
Britney, bitch
MCM seats buck 50 stitch
Versace plates got the Basquiat
Collab from Versace's place
Cuban link 5 kilo
Your life is illegal when your chain can get the rico
Real niggas all feel the hook


[Chorus]
Let's work
D-boy drug dealer look
Billionaire
D-boy drug dealer look
Billionaire nigga!
From the coca leafs to the farmers
To the polo fleece to the bombers

[Verse 1; Jay-Z]
Geah, yeah
Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up
So I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
Went from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me (are you happy, Hov'?)
I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life
Colleek, are you praying for me?
See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
For the sins of a father
So I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays
In hopes that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave


[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream to me
Gun shots sing to these other guys
But lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying
Every day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space in this world of fly girls
Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls
Benzes round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
Some said: "Hov', how you get so fly?"
I said: "From not being afraid to fall out the sky"
My physical's a shell so when I say farewell
My soul will find an even higher plane to dwell
So have no fear, just know that
Life is but a beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream


[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream
Can't mimic my life, I'm the thinnest cut slice
Intercut, the winner's cup
With winters rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes with this life just eyes
So to map it out you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you, chica
Your corazon is what brought us home
In great shape like Heidi Klum, Maricon, I am on
Permanent vacay, life is but a beach chair
This song is like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print
A map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes, and so you won't lose scent
I'll make a stink for you to think
I ink these verses full of prose
So you won't get conned out of two cent
My last will and testament I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
He said I'm worth it, his one desire
He kissed me, his one and only, (yes) beautiful liar

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce & Shakira]
You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry


[Chorus: Beyonce & Shakira, Both]
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it? (Ha Ha Ha)

(Oh) We can live without them
Just a beautiful liar

[Verse 2: Shakira]
I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing


[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce & Shakira]
We'll never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone

[Chorus: Beyonce & Shakira, Both]
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma

[Verse 1: Beyonce & Shakira]
He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about 'em that you wouldn't want to read about
He kissed me, his one and only, (yes) beautiful liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about

[Verse 2: Beyonce & Shakira]
I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce & Shakira]
We'll never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone

[Bridge: Beyonce & Shakira, both]
Tell me how to forgive you
When it's me who's ashamed
And I wish could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame

[Verse 1]
There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, so baby, good looking out

[Chorus 1]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now


[Verse 2]
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To I think that there was a time that I almost loved you

Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Bridge]
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye


[Chorus 3]
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had

[Intro]
Ohh, baby
Ohh, baby

[Verse 1]
I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights
You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me lets me know you're mine

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

[Verse 2]
I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you?
Boy, don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you, whoa
There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you
Baby, I love making love to you
It's like a high I can't come down from you


[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name (Scream my name)
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

[Intro: Beyonce]
If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ah, you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret, no

[Refrain: Beyonce]
Understand that truth about that question in your soul
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh, take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'
No, I'm not just preachin', I'm takin' my own advice

[Verse: Beyonce]
Let Mama let you know (Let you know)
Mama's still tryin'
I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it
I had to say that thing twice (Twice)
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I would fight, so I fight
If you're feelin' frustrated and (Oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (Oh)
Forgiveness is key because
We're fightin' something way bigger
You'll never lose, we are winners
I'll be the roots, you'll be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah
We're part of something way bigger


[Chorus: Beyonce]
(Yeah) Bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
Legacy, oh
You're part of something way bigger

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary
You just don't know it yet
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise

[Chorus: Beyonce & RAYE]
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than me
Bigger than the picture they paint us to be, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're part of something way bigger


[Refrain: Beyonce]
Understand that truth about that question in your soul (Bigger)
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold (Bigger)
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print (Bigger)

Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car (Car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you
Who don't know what a man's about

[Chorus]
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Now you've been maxing out my card (Card)
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But instead you're headin' to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees perpetrating
Telling your friends that you be ballin'
And then you use my cell phone (Phone)
Callin' whoever that you think's at home
And then when the bill comes
All of a sudden you be acting dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your momma's number's here more than once

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother

[Intro]
Can you tell us about love?
Hmm, well there's love of children
Love of self
Love of God
Love of a partner
All of them have a different shape
But all of them is the same in the end
It's about sensitivity, it's about passion
It's about unconditional giving of self to another person
And there's love of humanity
That's the love that is right now needed most
Love of humanity
But in everything, in all of that love, there is a soul
It's like when you take some eggs and break them
And you take the shells and mix them up
Trying to find the ones that match
And you find the perfect match
When you find the perfect match
That compatibility results in passion
Results in unconditional giving of self
I hope I can say that again

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
I'm good on any MLK Boulevard

Yes, put 'em up, this is not a test
Now hands where I can see them, fuck a false arrest

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
This Off-White fit that I rock, shit permanent
Hmm, the fro that I grow got no perm in it
Hmm, a nigga late but he best dressed
Got slowed down by the weight of my necklaces
Parked the Lexus in the projects, bitch I'm reckless
Extra magazine hopped on a jet with my Ebony chick
Blacker than the Essence fest
The behind the back pass is so effortless
LeBron James to you Omaroses
Dapper Dan at 4AM, shit, I am the culture
I made my own waves so now they're anti-Tidal
I'm livin' the no sock life to spite you
Since the Kalief doc, they've been at my neck
Y'all can tell 'em Trayvon is comin' next
The SEC, the FBI or the IRS
I pass the alphabet boys like an eye test

[Chorus: JAY-Z and Beyonce]

Come up out that pretty motherfucker like "Hello, Hello"
I will never let you shoot the nose off my Pharaoh
I like purple and purple rain
Tryin' to put red and blue together, bitch, that's on gang
These people tryna get me out the paint
'Cause I cook collard greens and yams better than your aunt
Man, we started with a mustard seed
Now we in the gray 911 with the mustard seats
Sheesh! Matte black puma jet
Shining my light on the world just like "UMI Says"
Got the Richard Mille all colors
Might hit you with the Rose Gold all summer
For the culture
They even biting cornrows, put your scarecrows up

Tell em the god's on row, watch them line the block
The Chitlin' circuit is stopped

You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I
I know you never waste a drip, I know you never waste a drip
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle (yeah)
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle (yeah)
I'm-a lean back
Don't worry it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor


[Verse 2: Pharrell]
If you're thirsty and in love just hit your boy
I'm your milk man at your door
When you phone me I can see you with your cup
I'm just role playing
(Must be good to you)

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning

Ooh I've had a naughty thought today, baby
Every time I close my eyes
Ooh get a glimpse of this candy paint
Don't slip off when it drip off on top of your ride
When you see it here, lift it up then toss it babe

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
Blue

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you
'Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's live it up

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?

Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready B? Let's go get 'em
Look for me, Young, B, cruising down the Westside highway
Doing what we like to do, our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashing the gas, she's grabbing the wheel
It's true to the heart, she rides with me
The new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keeping me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie & Clyde, Hov' and B
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you loving
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humping
Now they 'bout nothing if ever you mad about something
It won't be that, oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walking this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you working at Kermain, Birkin Bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if it's somebody takes my place
Yeah-hee

(Break it down for 'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend

Mm, mm

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Ain't nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it, boss
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one
Ain't nothing to it (there's nothing!) boss

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Heh, I paid the cost
Who gon' take it all? (take it all)
I record then I ball (then I ball!)
I ignored a lot of calls (click, click)
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', I ain't got no time
Got that dinero on my mind
Ohh, I got real problems just like you (bitch!)
Tell that bitch, "I don't like you" (I don't fuck with you!)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Ain't nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) boss
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) I boss
Ohhh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh oh oh oh ohhh, oh yeah


[Verse 2: JAY-Z & Beyonce]
Let me get 'em, B, yeah
Hundred million crib, three million watch, all facts
No cap; false nigga, you not a boss, you got a boss
Niggas getting jerked, that shit hurts, I take it personally
Niggas rather work for the man than to work with me
Just so they can pretend they on my level, that shit is irkin' to me
Pride always goeth before the fall, almost certainly
It's disturbing what I gross (what I gross!)
Survey says you not even close (not even close)
Everybody's bosses 'til it's time to pay for the office
'Til them invoices separate the men, from the boys
Over here we measure success by how many people successful next to you
Here we say you broke if everybody is broke except for you
Boss!

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Ain't nothing to it, real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) boss (boss, boss, boss)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) I boss
Ohhh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh oh oh oh ohhh, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Ain't nothing to it, I bossed up out my momma whip
My great-great-grandchildren already rich
That's a lot of brown chil'ren on your Forbes list
Frolickin' around my compound on my fortress, boss (boss, boss, boss)
Ohh, I be ridin' 'round with my seat reclinin'
Droppin' my daughter off at school every morning
We slammin' car doors
I be true ballin' on these bum whores
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothing, I ain't got no time, boss
Chill, tell them paps they gotta relax (you tried it!)
Toes in the sand, momma gettin' fat (snack)


[Chorus: Beyonce]
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) boss (boss)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) I boss

I'll be your bridge you can use to

Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way
And I will pick you up
Over mountains high
Together we'll walk over the bridge

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
There's a place where you can go
Lay your head down comfortable
And it's always there for sure
Don't you know
And it comes as no surprise
Mountains that you must climb
Sit back, don't run away
Have no shame
(There's no wrong) There's no wrong
(There's no right) No right
(It's only you, and how you treat your life)
See, baby
If the road you choose
Don't work out for you
You know (You know)
I'll be your rescue
Sugar, sugar

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
I'll be your bridge you can use to (Bridge)

Baby, I will pick you up
Over mountains high (Over mountains high)
Together we'll walk over the bridge

[Verse 2: Beyonce & (Destiny's Child)]
Like a diamond shining bright
See, you are young and flying high
Big dreams of having things in your eyes (Do-do, do-do, hey!)
You thought it all was making cash
But, uh, that small means never lasts
Had to throw it all away
Hear me say

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Let me take far away
You're sure to find your destiny
And you know without a doubt
That I will be your bridge out

I'll be your bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to (Whenever you need to)
Get over problems in your way (I'll be your bridge)


[Verse 1]
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe

I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl

[Verse 2]
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Remember the first day when I saw your face?
Remember the first day when you smiled at me?
You stepped to me and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about
Remember the first day when you called my house?
Remember the first day when you took me out?
We had butterflies although we tried to hide it
And we both had a beautiful night

[Pre-Chorus]
The way we held each others hand
The way we talked the way we laughed
It felt so good to fall in love
I knew right then and there you were the one

[Chorus: All]
I know that he loves me cause he told me so
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause its obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell his soul

[Verse 2: Destiny's Child, Beyonce]
Remember the first day, the first day we kissed
Remember the first day we had an argument
We apologized and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since
Remember the first day we stopped playing games
Remember the first day you fell in love with me
It felt so good for you to say those words
Cause I felt the same way too

[Pre-Chorus]
The way we held each others hand
The way we talked the way we laughed
It felt so good to fall in love
I knew right then and there you were the one

[Chorus: All]
I know that he loves me cause he told me so
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause its obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell his soul

[Bridge: All, Beyonce]
I'm so happy, so happy that you're in my life
And baby now that you're a part of me
You've showed me
Showed me the true meaning of love, the true meaning of love
And I know he loves me

[Chorus: All]
I know that he loves me cause he told me so
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause its obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell his soul
He looks at me and his brown eyes tell his soul

[Intro: Drake & Beyonce]
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Yeah, can I, baby? Can I, baby?

[Verse: Drake & Beyonce]
Can I bring you to the six where I really stay, baby?
Show you why I am the way I am
Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, baby?
'Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
Can I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?
You do so much more than that for me
Can I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?
'Cause that's the side you never get to see
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be


[Outro: Drake & Beyonce]
Can I, baby? Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Can I? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Before I turn the lights out



[Verse 1: Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen]
I can see what's happening (I can't, what?)
And they don't have a clue (Who's they?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two (Oh, I get it)
The sweet caress of twilight (Yep)
There's magic everywhere (It's everywhere)
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

[Chorus: Beyonce & Donald Glover]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

[Verse 2: Donald Glover]
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible
She'd turn away from me

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?

[Chorus: Beyonce & Donald Glover]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

[Outro: Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen]
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed




[Beyonce]
The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgiven

I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown underground?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Believing in the cards you must respect its every vision

[Wyclef]
Girlfriend, get your mind on line
Don't spend your time cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last, but you must feel divine
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind

Love!
You feel it and you got to let them know it
Love!
Your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over

[Beyonce]
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn

[Rah Digga]
Carmen, don't listen cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older

[Wyclef]
But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals before she reaches the sky

[Beyonce]
This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got and other times it makes you pay

[Wyclef]
Well when you finally rise
Then you'll realize

[Beyonce]
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes

[Wyclef]
Oh You could wish on the stars but they're dead, just a lie

[Beyonce]
But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn

No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn


[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Baby, I see you working hard

If I want it (you got it)
When I ask you (you provide it)
You inspire me to be better
You challenge me for the better
Baby, sit back and let me pour out my love letter

[Chorus: Beyonce]

Cause, baby, this is your day
Do anything for my man
Baby, you blow me away

Anything you want, just let me cater to you
Inspire me from the heart

Making sure that I'm doing my part
Boy, is there something you need me to do?
If you want it (I got it)
Say the word (and I'll try it)
I know whatever, I'm not fulfilling
Another woman is willing
I'm gonna fulfill your mind, body and spirit
I promise ya
I'll keep myself up
Remain the same chick
You fell in love with
I'll keep it tight, I'll keep my figure right

All I wanna do, is cater to you, boy

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
The day you pissed me off
I told Mike to pick me up (Uh)
I told him you was buggin'
And I don't like to fuss (Uh)
He said he would look out for me
If I needed a friend (Ooh)
He took me to his house
And then he invited me in (Say what?)
Then we sat on the couch
He put his arms around my waist (Oh)
Knowin' I need lovin'
And then he grabbed my face (Oh)
He kissed me like a guy could never kiss a girl before (Ooh)
So you know what happened
Baby, I need to say no more

[Chorus (Beyonce, Missy Elliott)]
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did (Confessing)
I might as well come clean (Yeah, yeah)
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did (Ohh ohhhh)
I might as well come clean (Come clean)
What you feel about that, baby?

I'm just guessing (Guessing, yeah)

'Cause I just came clean (Don't be through with me)
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just guessing
Are you through with me? (Are you through with me?)
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that? (Verse 2)

[Verse 2: Beyonce (Missy)]
Remember the time you wondered
Where your money went? (Uh huh)
I called my friends and bought some clothes
And took them on a trip (Uh)
I met a dude that had a Jeep
And we talked all the time (Uh)
He asked me about my man
And you know that I had to lie (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh)
He thought I had no man
And I was chillin' by myself
Don't get mad, 'cause I feel sad
That's why I must confess
Too many times I wanted to
Let you know my dirt
But everytime you said you loved me
I knew it would hurt

[Chorus (Beyonce, Missy Elliott)]
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did (Confessing, yeah, ohh oh)
I might as well come clean (Come clean!)
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did (Confessing, yeah)
I might as well come clean (Come clean, baby)
What you feel about that, baby? (Come clean, baby)

I'm just guessing (Uh huh)

'Cause I just came clean (Came clean)
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just guessing (Guessing)
Are you through with me? (Are you through with me?)
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that? (Ooh la-la-la-la-la, I was mad)

[Bridge: (Missy)]
I was mad, what was I to do?
Never had it in mind to play on you (On you boo)
But look at all the hurt you put me through
I can't tell a lie so I'm tellin' the truth (Uh)
I was mad, what was I to do? (Say what?)
Never had it in mind to play on you (Ooh)
But look at all the hurt you put me through
You know, (You know) you know (You know)

That you're through with me (2-0-0)
'Cause I just came clean (One thou)
What you feel about that, baby?
I'm just guessing
Are you through with me?

[Commandment 4: Kelly]
Thou shall not bug


[Verse 1]
I gotta give up to quiet
The storm that rages inside
The way that I hid my damage pride
You gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strength to follow it through
I'm ready to change

[Chorus]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control

[Verse 2]
I'm opening up
Show me a sign I can't believe
These crazy emotions flow through me
I'm gonna explode, oh
You take me away
And what is my ordinary life
I won't be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold


[Chorus]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all, no

[Bridge]
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
New horizon ready to paint
With every breath, you take me away

[Chorus]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control

I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, if anything, I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
You crazy? Bring ya whole set
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, "Hey, is he insane?" (Oh, no)
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
The game's been a wrap, one


[Bridge: Beyonce]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing no one else can


[Chorus]

Looking so crazy in love got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy, baby
HEY!

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is?" look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing no one else can

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy, baby
HEY!

[Chorus:  Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)

Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

Exotically tempting, familiar to me

The yellow bone flavor is familiar to me
Mix it all together; it's a delicacy

[Verse 1]
I remember when you use to take me on a bike ride everyday on the bayou
(You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)

[Chorus]
Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why...
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me
Daddy, daddy, daddy...

[Verse 2]
I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you should've seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo
Could have said "Beyonce, I told you so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)


[Chorus]
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why...
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

[Bridge]
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional it won't go away
I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities

[Chorus]
Love is overwhelming
Lord, why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy


[Outro]
(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you daddy.)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else replace my daddy...

That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up

The love that's in-between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last

Hey Shawty show me that you love the way, that I do
Whatever, to show the world I'm crazy bout you
I tell them everything amazing bout you
The reason behind me saying I do
It's hidden in the way you toot it in the air and drop it down
And give it to me dirty when nobody ain't around
Your legs in the air and your clothes on the ground
And your head in the pillow, trying to hold in the sound
Now come here Shawty, let me grab and hold that
Remote control that, I love to rock when you you there for me
I want you to know that, when you undressing
It's like I'm living out a fantasy
Cause you so soft, and I'm not that
You want this, well you got that
Magnum lifestyle, know I'm bout that
That Bentley, lay you on top that
Knock that ass from here to tomorrow
On the balcony, out in Cabo
Know a shopping spree will follow
I'm in love, watching you model
Couple candle lights, create the ambiance
And yo lingerie and yo Louis Vuitton
Pussy sick and slow music on
And I'm watching you like it's a movie yo

Baby I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation and connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am a seed (I am a seed)
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I'm blooming, grown so beautifully (Grown so beautifully)

Later on in my destiny I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife and

You school me, give me things to think about
Ignite me, you excite me

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I met this girl, named Nicki
I guess you could say, she was the rap queen
I met her in the studio lobby
But her booty look bigger in the magazines
She said, "Bey, would you jump in this song of mine?"
How could I resist?
When I heard little Nicki rhyme


[Intro: Beyonce & Jay-Z]
Bass (Uh)
Hi-hat (Uh)
808 (Uh)

Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh)
C'mon (C'mon)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & (Beyonce)]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go


[Chorus: Beyonce]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Deja Vu

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Flow, blow, what's the difference?

It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Deja Vu, just me and my- (OH!)

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having Deja Vu?

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute (Here we go)
Baby, I swear it's deja vu

[Post-Chorus: Beyonce]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Outro]
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light

[Verse 1]
I don't have a reason to cry
And I have every reason to smile
I don't have a reason to lie
When you're already reading my mind
And I don't have a reason to be, if I can't be with you
And I don't need air in my lungs, if I can't sing your song
No, I don't need hands if I don't get to keep you warm
And I don't really need myself, if I don't need you

[Chorus]
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you

[Verse 2]
And I don't really need these fingers, if I don't get to touch your spine
Well, I don't need these legs, if I ain't walking by your side
And I don't really need to be if I can't be with you

[Chorus]
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you


[Outro]
I live so I can die with you



[Verse 1]
If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight?
Would it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by?

[Chorus]
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)

[Verse 2]
And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right

[Chorus]
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)

[Bridge]
I missed all the signs, one at a time
You were ready
What did I know?
Starting our lives
Now my love, I'm ready to show

[Chorus]
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear

You're only lying to yourself
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself
Don't hurt yourself


[Refrain]
You just gotta let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby
Hey baby

[Verse 2]
Who the fuck do you think I is?
I smell that fragrance on your Louis knit, boy
Just give this fat ass a big kiss, boy
Tonight, I'm fucking up all your shit, boy

[Bridge]
(The most disrespected person in America is the black woman)
I am the dragon breathing fire
(The most unprotected person in America is the black woman)
Beautiful mane, I'm the lion
(The most neglected person in America is the black woman)
Beautiful man, I know you're lying

[Outro]
This is your final warning (Don't hurt yourself)
You know I give you life (Don't hurt yourself)
If you try this shit again (Don't hurt yourself)
You gon' lose your wife

[Non-Lyrical Vocal Outro]

If it's what you truly want
I can wear her skin over mine, her hair over mine
Her hands as gloves, her teeth as confetti
Her scalp, a cap
Her sternum, my bedazzled cane
We can pose for a photograph, all three of us
Immortalized
You and your perfect girl



[Verse 1: Tekno]
Ah ha
Suzuki no be Chang Jiang
Jet Li no be Liu Kang
You know me I not a pretender
From start of the week to the weekend, ah

Footwork like Pogba
If you get on my ton ton ton
Me I want to get on your don don don

Hello world, well I just bought here
My dress: Paris
My shoes: Rome
My fur: House of Dereon and
My fragrance: Diamonds
Well, I love Paris and I love Rome
But I always know when I'm away too long
Is when I start missing the man at home

I'm your dream girl boys
I'm back, are you happy?
I'm your dream girl boy
Show me how you care

I'm your dreamgirl boys how I hated to leave you
If you wanna keep me, all you gotta do is:
Hold me, touch me, squeeze me
Love me, leave me crusty, dress me, undress me

Baby, baby, baby
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there




[Verse 1]
When I'm here in your arms, I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinching myself, I don't care, I'm with you, you with me
I never wished on the star when the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
Ohh

[Chorus]
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I'm supposed to be

[Pre-Chorus]
When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
Ohh

[Chorus]
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
It took a lifetime just to get with you, to be with you, baby
And now that I'm here with you, I'm gonna take it in, breathe you in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And if I am dreaming, let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I'd rather dream about you than living life without me and you, you

[Chorus]
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Ohh
(Let me know) If this is a dream

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)


[Hook: BOOTS]
All my life I've been dreaming of you
I've been dreaming of you, I've been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

[Verse 1: BOOTS]
Stop asking so many questions now
I slip on your slip, but got a long, long way to go
You got a long, long way to go
I sleep on the floor-boards, I kiss the ground
My heart is a stone, I got a long, long way to go
I got a long, long way to go

[Hook]
All my life I've been dreaming of you
I've been dreaming of you, I've been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

[Verse 2: BOOTS]
Yeah, I know the problems I'm left with
See I know the leaves were our first gifts
I know how I hurt you, I'm certain my tongue sets on fire, a furnace
Yeah, we'll always find a way and we'll always find a way
A way, a way to wake up
A way, a way, a way, a way


[Hook: Beyonce & BOOTS]
All my life I've been dreaming of you
I've been dreaming of you, I've been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Cause baby we got a lot of life to live
You're the only one that I would stand by
And baby we got a lot of love to give
Maybe we could put the whole world on standby

[Hook: Beyonce & BOOTS]
All my life I've been dreaming of you
I've been dreaming of you, I've been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you



[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyonce]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin'
On the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
Hahaha!

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyonce & JAY-Z]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now... Hold up!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
That D'USSE is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

[Chorus: Beyonce]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyonce]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Chorus: Beyonce]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

She said fuck me rough, don't take it easy on me
Don't do me no favors

Fuck you so hard you turn around like goodness gracious
You ask for this and you know I accommodate ya
She doing tricks on my dick cause I'm a skater

Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na

Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love

No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights, boy I'm drinking
Walking in my l'assemblage

If you scared, call that reverend, boy I'm drinking
Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up , boy I'm drinking
I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then riding with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin', grainin' on that wood

Big body been servin' all this

Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard

Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight
Catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!" Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!" I'm nice!
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight

[Verse 1]
I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers

[Verse 2]
Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on, bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it, droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower

[Chorus]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night

[Intro]
I've been drinking
Boy, I'm drinking
Turn it, turn it
Ay, turn up!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm so drunk in with love with her
Her double Ds spilling out my double cup
And she say champagne ain't strong enough
But she never real say ain't long enough
When I lift up all that Herve Leger
You see expression like it's be amazing there
Whatever you do better watch my hair
Too late, oups baby, you made it there
She try to take it there
And I swerve all over in that Rolls Royce on the way to my house
And shorty been drinking like a fish all night, wanna hit it right now
No Merlot, just camel toe, slap all on my handy ball
Ok, handcuffs, ain't no fan of those
But you ain't gonna need any hands at all
Now don't take this as misogyny when I say take this mahogany
And let me put it all in until it's hard to see
Beat it up and reverse till it's hard to breathe
Ok, you're not dealing with inexperience, promise I'm giving you pipe
Learn it, if I keep pouring up you keep throwing back
Shots will be in the air all night

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?

Uh this goes out to you(you) and you(you) and you(you) and you
Oh listen

[Verse 1:]
To say im egotistical
Is so stereotypical
If I say im the shit then baby you can be my tissue roll
Girl you like a toostie roll
How many licks do it take till it stick to my face(I wanna know)
45 46... 50 licks
Got somewhere to go so can we make it quick
Not a quickie though
Have faith like Biggie though
We in the chase for that Diddy dough
I should make a sex video
Way I'm hitting hoes
They be singing opera like figueroa figueroa figueroa
Yea singin' nigga from the ghetto
Ain't nothing like a pretty woman in stilettos
(Yeaa) Sex Olympics, I won a medal
Girl you need to ride no brakes no pedals
Yea I'm drunker then a motherfucka
Even when I'm drunk tho I'm hotter then these other bustas
They say I'm wrong for saying that
(Well)But shit you wrong for saying that
I'm sick of dos equis
You so petty
I'm so ready
Once had a akward moment only cause I wanted to
Middle finger my opponents
Baby girl I'm zoning
And I really give a fuck if you was on it
Song called bedroom cause you featured on it
Satin sheets bed room I'mma beat you on it
They say my head big
Cause my head is
So I walk like my legs big
Is it illegal to have an ego the size of pluto
When I
Know that I'm flyer
Then any guy that you know

Baby what you name is
Tell me who you hang with
Money out the anus
I can make you famous
So many people say that I'm conceited
(Well damn! Come on)
I'm really starting to believe it
Set a lot of goals and I'm starting to achieve it
Tell me what's the reason
Winter spring summer fall
All of ya'll think I'm the one you wanna be with
I be on some "G" shit
I hit it the deepest

Chorus[Beyonce and Trey]
(Beyonce)
Too big
Too wide
Too strong
It won't fit
Its too much

(Trey)
She talk like this cause I can back it up(true)
I got a big you know(yes I do)
Such a huge you know
Its so big
Cause she love my big you know(that's what she said)
I talk like this cause I can back it up

[Verse 2:]
Flight got delayed I was waiting on the call
Couple hours later performing for a crowd
Said that I'm the shit
Shawty watch me move a bowel
Just like Vanna White when shawty move a vowel

The beast tryna eat her
Wilder beast on the prowl
Get it super wet, now you gone need a towel
You a super freak gone and put it in yo mouth
Have fun, oh baby, we gone end up with a child

Chorus
(Beyonce)
Too big
Too wide

Cause she love my big you know(that's what she said)
I talk like this cause I can back it up


[Intro]
Aw baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made...
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus]

Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you a sight to see

I got a big ego (Ha ha ha), I'm such a big ego (Uh-uh-uh)
I got a big, (eh-eh-eh), ego, she love my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
So stroke my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl, 'cause
Every thing I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl She said, "Know what, grow up, you nasty,"
"I don't understand why they trippin', if you ask me"
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I'm standing next to Jay who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
That's good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers, kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego

Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song

I wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. And it came so effortlessly after I finished the film of my life, "Dreamgirls". Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics. This is "Listen"...

[Intro: Effie (C.C. spoken)]
What about what I need?
(Curtis says it's the best thing for the group)
What about what's best for me?
(He feels the Dreams can cross over)
What about how I feel?
(But when we're famous, I'll write great things for ya. Effie, do it for me)
What about me? What about me?

[Verse 1: C. C.]
It's more than you. It is more than me
No matter what we are, we are a family
This dream is for all of us
This one can be real
And you can't stop us now
Because of how you feel

[Verse 2: C.C.]
It's more than you. It is more than me
Whatever dreams we have, they're for the family
We're not alone anymore, now there are others there
And that dream's big enough
For all of us to share

So don't think you're going
You're not going anywhere
You're staying and taking your share
And if you get afraid again, I'll be there

[Hook: C. C., Deena, Lorrell, & Curtis]
We are a family, like a giant tree
Branching out toward the sky
We are a family, we are so much more
Than just you and I
We are a family like a giant tree

[Bridge: C. C.]
Growing stronger, growing wiser

[Outro. C. C., Deena, Lorrell, & Curtis]
We are growing free
We need you
We are a family

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Moncler jackets I can't feel the winter
To my shahada pray daily but know I'm still a sinner
When the family feud, it's hard to chill at dinners
We can't even eat together, she fronting like Ben Stiller
I lied I ain't putting hands on no female
Unless I'm up inside her, I pay attention to detail
Single black chick, taking classes working retail
Know he from the hood
But don't know the product that he sell
I got your bitch on the boat, yeah we sail
The dick got her stalking me asking me what's my email
Guarantee she call again, shit it's me and Don again
Same niggas talking shit, was right there in the offering
Paranoid, imma circle the block before I park again
Givenchy hoodie, blocking the cameras when I be walking in
J mob, tell em don't quit their day job
I was on a space pack pitching feeling like A-Rod
I did a video with Fab and niggas took my face off
Bitches love me, I go through more laps than a racehorse
Headline my own tour without a hit record
Bitches lose control, when they see me they get naked
DJ's pressing me like yo East I need like 10 records
My daughter the only one, I went got me like 10 weapons
Constructs in the winter, I'm usually Timbs stepping
Your bitch wanna be on my chest and imma bench press her


[Interlude]
Couldn't get anymore higher than this man
NY shit nigga, East, Don
You got to save me some room on this one, you feel me my nigga

[Verse 2: Don Q]
This where all the players emerge
All the tables reserved
20 thousand, that's too much bottles for the waitress to serve
From public housing now a nigga found his way to the burbs
Thinking the life you will never understand the way I observe
Out the window, I'm brainstorming thinking while the rain pouring
Like since the fame things ain't really been the same for em
Back and forth, switching planes
Different chains on us
When we back at home we gripping things for all the name calling
I know you niggas name calling
Be yourself before you see the wealth
Trust me I learned a lot of shit without the teacher help
Somethings I had to teach myself
You prolly won't imagine
Like how to tote a magnum, movin, getting low from wagons
Shit don't give me no reaction
All they see is foreigns passing, Rollies flashing
What about when we was in that lonely attic
Shedding tears 'cause the other side just let my homies have it
Loading ratchets, we won't be the only one who closing caskets
Nigga everyday it's numbers
I always kept the same hunger
Learned from the OG's that I was raised under
Pure cocaine cutters
Now the Range cocaine colored
Gold rings and my whole chain smothered
When I had no name I was a 4 train jumper
Butter rolls for breakfast, Lo Mein suppers
I cutting hoes off ain't no need to exchange numbers
Got this lane covered, no wonder the game love us


[Verse 3: Dave East]
D and Don, brothers without the same mother
Couple rings speak like a king, Lebron James love it
Press Baby for cash money and Wayne debit
Dissin and it ain't even get to us, you ain't buzzing
Nah, nah we ain't budging (at all)



[Chorus]
I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
You think you're cute, you think you're fine
You're always trying to steal my shine
Get off of me, don't mess with me
You know who you are

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I've always been so nice to you, girl
Helping you girl, there for you girl
You always tried to compete with me, girl
Using me girl, abusing me girl
Flirtin' with every man you see
Especially if the man likes me
Baby where's your self esteem
Find your own identity

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly (with Michelle)]
(Your head ain't right) No congratulating schemer
(Your head ain't right) You's a liar and a cheater
And I don't want you I don't want you I don't want you no more
Don't come knockin' at my door
I don't know what you came here for
If you didn't know then now you know

[Chorus]
I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
I don't fancy you too much, child

You think you're cute, you think you're fine
You're always trying to steal my shine
Get off of me, don't mess with me
You know who you are

[Verse 2: Beyonce, Michelle]
Roll those eyes girl, twist them hips girl
Swing those hands all in the air
If you wonder why you never had a girlfriend
I think I made myself clear
Girl change your ways right now today
Stop hating me, baby find your own identity

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly (with Michelle)]
(Your head ain't right) No congratulating schemer
(Your head ain't right) You's a liar and a cheater
And I don't want you I don't want you I don't want you no more
Don't come knockin' at my door
I don't know what you came here for
If you didn't know then now you know

[Chorus]
I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
You think you're cute, you think you're fine
You're always trying to steal my shine
Get off of me, don't mess with me
You know who you are

[Verse 3: Beyonce, Kelly]
Girlfriend, Lord knows that I've tried
No matter how much I give to you
You wanna use me for what I got
You take my kindness for weakness, you take advantage of people
One day you shall reap what you sow
Girl get your head up out the clouds
Ohhh yeah

[Bridge: All, Michelle]
Girlfriend, you think you're cute
Girlfriend, don't ya think you're fine
Girlfriend, you're always trying
Always trying to steal my shine
Girlfriend, you think you're cute
Girlfriend, don't ya think you're fine
Girlfriend, you're always trying
Always trying to steal my shine

[Chorus (Beyonce)]
I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
I don't fancy you too much, child

You think you're cute, you think you're fine

I don't fancy you too much

I don't fancy you too much (I'm not feelin' you)
You think you're cute, you think you're fine

You're always trying to steal my shine (Doin' all that dirt)
Get off of me, don't mess with me

I won't say no names

[Intro: Kelly Rowland]
You know, we've been spending a lot of time together and um, I was wondering do you:
(Feel the same way I do)
I can tell you, I know you need me to show you, but, it's better if I hear it from you
You know what, let me explain myself

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland & (Destiny's Child)]
It's 7 am you're still here with me
And last night I held you tightly, so
What does that mean
You see I know what it means to me
It means that I, I, wouldn't let you go
Tell me, is your heart still spinning from the night before?
(You are real good yeah)
And you really need to let me know are you here just for (Sexual dealings)
See if you are then (I)
I just can't live a (lie)
Cause I'm certain how I feel about you
But if you tell me, (I) am the one and this is (right)
Then we can spend the night tonight like always
But first you gotta tell me

[Hook: Kelly Rowland & (Destiny's Child)]
That you (Feel the same way I do)
Darling you know
That I won't let you know unless you
(Feel the same way I do)
So if you tell me what I gotta do, before I get caught up in you
Do you really (Feel the same way I do)
So tell me, tell me, uscan be a good thing
But you gotta (Feel the same way I do)
Do

[Verse 2: Beyonce & (Destiny's Child)]
So now it midnight, haven't heard a reply
But I can see the truth lies in your eyes
Could it be that you tried
But I didn't see the sunset pass me by, when you were making love to me
Said it three times, (you said) you love me, (after) you held me
But then, you never even said good night
(Anything I ask of you) you give it
(When you wanted me) I submitted, still no commitment, but if I don't get it then
(I) I just can't live a (lie), cause I'm certain how I feel about you
But if you tell me, (I), I am the one and this is (right)
You can spend the night tonight like always
Long as you first tell me

[Hook: Beyonce & (Destiny's Child)]
That you (Feel the same way I do)
Darling you know
That I won't let you know unless you (Feel the same way I do)
So if you tell me what I gotta do, before I get caught up in you
Do you really (Feel the same way I do)
So tell me, tell me, this could be a good thing
But you gotta (Feel the same way I do)

[Bridge: Michelle]
Ooh, I see your eyes, and I hear you calling
(When you're speaking) and I need to hear something
First thing I wanna hear (I've been meaning to tell you something)
The second thing is (If I can't have you I don't want nothing)

[Outro: Kelly Rowland & Male Voice]
Who that knocking at my door this time of night?
Ooh oh, hey baby
What you doing over here so late?
I wanted to tell you something
I just, I don't know how to tell you right
Do you have anything you want to say?
Alright, you know what, I love you

[Outro]
Feel the same way I do
Feel the same way I do
Feel the same way I do




[Verse 1]
Never knew how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

[Chorus]
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 2]
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I wanna treat you right

[Chorus]
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 3]
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you outta know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

[Verse 4]
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said to Julie "Baby you're my flame"
He givest fever
When we kisseth
Fever with my flaming youth
Fever, I'm on fire
Fever, yeah I burn forsooth

[Verse 5]
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said "Daddy, oh don't you dare"
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Daddy won't you treat him right

[Verse 6]
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade
They give ya fever
When we kiss ya
Fever if you live and learn
Fever until you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

[Outro]
You give me fever
Catch the fever
Catch the fever

Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

[Chorus: Ed Ed Sheeran & Beyonce]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 2: Ed Ed Sheeran & Beyonce]
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Beyonce]
Didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn

[Part 2: ***Flawless]

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-dah-de-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-Com-Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-dah-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)

You see potential in all my flaws

And that's exactly what I mean

[Hook]
I don't know why you love me

And that's why I love you

I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you

You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you

Ain't no feeling like being free

No looking back, no
Ooh this time is for me
Nigga you been doing you I'm gon' do me

Now, what we've been doing is looking at the data and we know that police somehow manage to deescalate, disarm and not kill white people everyday. So what's going to happen is we are going to have equal rights and justice in our own country or we will restructure their function and ours

Let's take a moment to stand and observe the Hell we live in
No matter how high the fire it never melts the system
Some can help but didn't, we fill up the jails and prisons
You don't believe that's a business, only yourself you're kiddin'
But now they killin' our people, it's all on television
Them cops went home to their people, turn on the television
I tell my son, careful what you learn on television
He 15, he don't know what I mean
Don't know about yet, doubt and suspect, out sets of controlled outlets
From those who don't wanna let us out yet
Land of the free, the home of the brave (nah)
Can't let us be, we've grown from slaves
It's there if you wanna read, I mean it's all on the page
Say it's police, I just know when it's race
Now it's just thrown in our face....
Maybe I'm lost, signs are vital to me
Sandra Bland didn't come off as suicidal to me
Y'all play around, thinkin' we on safe ground
They killed Tamir Rice and his rights, right on that playground
Eric was selling cigarettes, "I can't breathe," it was said
The bigger threat he was a nigga, I bet, but listen
Last year I went to church with my Mother Fay
We sat behind Ms. Garner, and it was Mother's Day
She sat strong, inside I cried for her
My eyes tucking the water as I was hugging his daughter...
Philando Castillo told him he had a weapons permit
Was murdered moments after without a complexion permit
That's bloodshed with his daughter in the car
I'm only upset for our sons and daughters tomorrow
Question, how many cities we gotta march through?
Signs we gotta hold up, or are they tryna provoke us?
Cause when them 9s load up, and land mines blow up
And the crime don't slow up, they'll chime in and say they told us
Or is it only a crime when done by poor us
Food for thought, my mind don't run off of cold cuts
Raw and evident, Alton was offed, heaven sent
Recorded the negligence, they just ignore the evidence
And make it seem as if we in y'all way
Maybe our government is governed by the NRA
That would make a diseased Capitol, in need of capital
They even legalized weed for the Capitol
But be black, sell in the street, they get mad at you
Casually clap at you, it's Uncle Sam sayin' taxes due
Our epidemic systemic
Black Panther fist at Olympics they just condemn it, hold up
Said the Klan marched in Piedmont
Even worse, they were protected by police arms
In Baton Rouge its pictures of them in riot gear
It tells me they know it's plenty reason to riot there
Yet we just keep on praying all while we feeling it
Racism still alive, now they not concealing it
It's revamped, shackles are gone, now we get house slippers
And all us millionaires are the house niggers
Irony, the only ones naked are urban outfitters
White people seeing us murdered are even down with us
They sayin' let's make America great again
I'm curious, what time would you like to place us in?
Were we degraded then? Did they enslave us then?
Or is it ignorant of me to even say again?
If it's civil war, then what are we civil for?
It's this is freedom to y'all, you better get us some more


[Hook: Beyonce]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move

Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Outro: Jesse Williams]
And we're done watching and waiting while this invention called whiteness uses and abuses us, burying black people out of sight and out of mind while extracting our culture, our dollars, our entertainment like oil - black gold, ghettoizing and demeaning our creations then stealing them, gentrifying our genius and then trying us on like costumes before discarding our bodies like rinds of strange fruit

Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice

Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah

Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs

[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable rights" of "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." We refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. So we have come to cash this check - a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice

Y'all switchin' sides like NBA teams just after halftime
I'm pullin' up on my dog, make sure he okay, I don't even have time
Then copped me a Porsche with butterscotch seats, this 'fore they had mils
Live better than rappers and they don't even have bills, it's that real
Bought Emory a BM as soon as he came home
We hopped on a plane, headed straight to the Bay
That's how we turn the game on, it's game on

Tight circle, no squares, I'm geometrically opposed to you
Y'all like to try angles, y'all like to troll, do you?
Y'all talk around hoes, do you? Y'all don't follow codes, do you?
We know everything you say from niggas close to you, you emotional
When I say, "Free the dogs," I free 'em, that's how Meek got his freedom
Y'all put niggas on a t-shirt, it hurts you ain't never meet 'em
You got niggas in the feds, you ain't even tryna feed 'em
I'm tryna free the world, that's how deep I'm in
I ain't goin' to nobody nothin' if me and my wife beefin'
I don't care if the house on fire, I'm dyin', nigga, I ain't leavin'

See better things for me, want better days for me, unexceptionally
They pray, pray for me, they pray, pray for me
Whenever I'm in need, they in the backseat, with the aux bumpin B
Uh ain't no pride involved, ain't no pride involved
In my heart, heart, heart, you know 4-4-4
That's my dog, dog, dogs, see your dogs, dogs, dogs
Point 'em out, out, out, point 'em out, out, out
What would I be without my friends? (What would I be without my friends?)

[Intro: Scarface]
They Love me

[Verse 1: Scarface]
They say now pass the ganja to the left hand side
Filpping in the Range Rover blowing past the one times
Hit me with the (whoop whoop)
Bubble gum flashing in my rear view
Spraying freshener trying to steer too
Throwin out my herbs on the passenger side
Got the windows rolled down, airing out the ride
Got a loaded .45 inside
That I keep for protection when I'm riding by
My Smith and Wesson got a scope too
And I may have caught a body on it
For those who get just know somebody want it
They only ?????
To know that you ain't done shit
But still you got them haters in your business
I'm paranoid she's blowing my high
And she knew that I was buzzin from the red in my eye
Got my license and my papers, Showed me my picture on The Source
Then what the fuck you stopping me for?
And she said

[Hook: Destiny's Child]
Gangsta Ow
Put me Down, Now
Gang-sta put me down
Now, Ow


[Verse 2: Scarface]
So I gave her my cellular number and told her call me up
Beating on my dashboard hot than a fuck
Cause I done chunked a half a square thinking 5-0 jocking trying to jam me up
I continue on my mission to my Grandma's house
Hollering at my homeboy who just got out
What's up let's roll
Get you some clothes
Take you to the club so you can get with some hoes
Lets go
Made to the mall hoes thick
Listenting to Pac screaming that's the shit
Getting geared when this woman appeared up out the blue
Telling me she like what I do
And the ho was like

[Hook: Destiny's Child]
Gangsta Ow
Put me Down, Now

[Verse 3: Willie-D]
Willie D's rollin on D's
In a drop top A-Z-U-R-E
With the knock knock banging
Listening to a song my nigga Face singing
Eardrums just a ringing, my homey bringing
A couple of honies to the hideaway
We gone fuck these hoes and straight ride away
Gotta pack confirmed tickets get some sleep
We rolling to the Baby Johnson fight a 100 niggas deep
Ain't bringing sand to beach
I got my eyes on some freak ass broads
And menage-a-trois
Never kiss and tell I keeps em horny as hell
And take my dick inside that pussy put it under a spell
Got more mail than the post office let me remind you
Don't stare at my diamonds too hard they might blind you
Freaky Deeky, Freaky Deeky Deeky
When you see me rolling past all you got to do is ask


[Hook: Destiny's Child]

We need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality. It isn't a reality yet. Today, women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes. But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change. Men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters earn more- commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender. Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect.

Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal? These old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning. We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life. And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible

We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities

[Intro: Timbaland]
Uhh...Uh...Hey baby - How you?
Why ya face lookin' all sad and blue?
Don't you like the Navigator truck I brought you?
Why you tryin' to act a fool?
Don't try to say you see me talkin' to ya girlfriend
Ask Tonya and Cheryl then, give me a place, a time and when
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff that I'm doin' on the street
You gotta remember, without you, there's no me
I'm just a average man, tryin' to make it in this cold world
Tell me baby, why you trippin' girl

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I don't wanna fuss with you
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch
Don't try to talk to me
'Cause, boy, I am lockin' you out
I don't wanna hear a thing
Nothin' you got to say
You should think twice about the way you been talkin' to me

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & (Beyonce)]
Better catch a cab
Get on the bus
I ain't got no time for you talkin' all that junk (Talkin' all that junk)
Give back my stuff
Is this what you want? (Yea)
I don't really care 'cause there's no more us! (Ohhh)
Better catch a cab
Get on the bus
I ain't got no time for you talkin' all that junk (Ohh)
Give back my stuff
Is this what you want?
I don't really care... (Ohh)

[Verse 2: Kelly]
Ain't got no words for you
So you can stop callin' my friends
Tellin' them it wasn't ya fault
And why I ain't lettin' you in
Too many times before
I let you back in my life
But this is a new day
And this won't go down tonight

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & (Kelly Rowland)]
Better catch a cab
Get on the bus
I ain't got no time for you talkin' all that junk (Talkin' all your ahh)

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
Say what?...uhh...uhh
Introduce you to Dolce Gabbana
Advance you from dirt bikes to Hondas
Took you from that terrible stress
Now you tellin' me that I am a bother
What kind of mess is that to tell a man who put you on his team
That's just like killin' a dream - (No, No baby) - that's how it seems
I worked hard to build up what I have with you
I pray to God there's not another man between me and you
So just tell me, there's no need to lie fo' (Lie fo')
Why you sleeping with your eyes closed? (Eyes closed)
You don't wanna talk?
Aight yo! (Aight yo)

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & (Beyonce)]
Better catch a cab (Hey!)
Get on the bus (Ohhhh)
I ain't got no time for you talkin' all that junk (Ohh ooh ohhh)
Give back my stuff
Is this what you want? (Is this what you want?)
I don't really care 'cause there's no more us! (Oohhh)
Better catch a cab
Get on the bus (Ohh oh)
I ain't got no time for you talkin' all that junk (Hey, ohh oh woah)
Give back my stuff, is this what you want?
I don't really care... (Ohh)

[Verse:]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

[Hook:]
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

[Bridge:]
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

[Outro:]
Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm




[Intro]
A gift from virgo

[Verse 1]
I wish I could look in your eyes
And tell you how I feel right now inside
Baby, I know that it's real
So real, so real, so real
How I wish I could be with you
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now

[Verse 2]
Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I wanna be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day
I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me

[Verse 3]
Do you remember our first kiss?
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together?
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough

[Chorus]
When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say goodbye
I never want to say goodbye
I never, ever want to say goodbye

[Bridge]
One day we'll make love
Finally I'll be yours
Only you, only you, I could love you
But it's too late, I already love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you


[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Take a minute girl, come sit down
And tell us what's been happening
In your face, I can see the pain
Don't you try to convince us that you're happy, yeah
We've seen this all before
Brothers taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone
You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?

[Verse 2: Kelly]
See, what y'all don't know about him
Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't making it easy
I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes, but I need my man
I don't think y'all understand, I'm telling you


[Chorus: Destiny's Child & (Beyonce)]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
(We understand, don't be ashamed, I'm your friend)
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
(I can tell he's been lying to you; he's no good for you)
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
(I can tell you've been crying)
And you needing somebody to talk to (I can see it in your eyes)
Girl, I can tell he's been lying (I can tell he's been lying)
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
(I can see it in the way you)
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
(I've been where you are, I know what you're feeling, girl)
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?

[Bridge: Michelle & Destiny's Child]
Girl, take a good look at yourself
He got you going through hell
We ain't never seen ya down like this
What you mean you don't need us to help?
We know each other too well
Girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya? (Yeah, yeah)


[Chorus: Destiny's Child & (Beyonce)]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying (Girl)
And you needing somebody to talk to
(I've been knowing you since you were 10)
Girl, I can tell he's been lying (You cannot hide from your friends)
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you (Girl)
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I know girls love Beyonce
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy, James Fauntleroy & Drake]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse]
Them that's got shall have
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible said and it still is news
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own


[Verse 1]
When you were born, the angels sighed in delight
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight
You took the breath and the world was right again
Tears were shed, how we had been blessed

[Pre-Hook]
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right, oh
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside

[Hook]
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful

[Verse 2]
Well look at me, you were brought into my life
I kiss those little feet and watch for your perfect smile
And when it comes, the world stops in your eyes
I found love, I found peace of the purest kind

[Pre-Hook]
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right, oh
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside


[Hook]
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful

Thank God, I get on my knees and pray
Thank God for giving me a life
You're beautiful, you're beautiful, too beautiful
God made you beautiful

[Hook]
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
You've been so good to me
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I'm grateful for my blessings

[Verse 1]
I'm grateful for my struggles
Trials and tribulations I've been through
I've realized no one can love like You do

[Chorus]
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I feel your presence near
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I won't hold back my tears

[Verse 2]
I gave you my trust
And you took me out of the dark rain
My Lord I survived it
I give You the praise

[Bridge]
Lord, You've been so good
You've been so good to me
I'm so grateful for my blessings
Givin You all the praise


Lord, You've been so good
You've been so good to me
I'm grateful for all of my blessings
Giving You all the praise

[Verse 3]
Jesus loves me, oh yes He does
Jesus loves me, oh yes He does
Jesus loves me, oh yes He does
For the Bible tells me so
So... so, ohhh... so..
(My Jesus loves me, I know)

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Now you wildin' in the club
Shorty keep askin' you what's up
Sho' 'nough
(Are they feelin' you?)
Cause they keep on looking you up and down
That's what's up
(Can we chill with you)
Yes indeedy come and slide with me
Come and grab a seat and just tell me what you're thinking
(oh)
You see my diamonds, cop a smile now
And you try to figure out what's outside now
(Think you can figure me out)
Oh no, I don't think so
While you think about it
I'm already on the road

[Pre-Chorus: Destiny's Child]
(Oh no)
Cause I need you to offer me something new
Don't talk about rides cause I gots my own driver
Don't talk about trips cause I gots to make hits
When I'm done, I need someone to chill with
(oh no)
Don't talk about planes cause I gots my own pilot
Don't talk about banks, my accountant just wires it
Don't talk about gear cause I gots my own line
So don't get mad cause UPS is hiring

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Don't talk about it baby
Be about it
What you say you got
I already got it
You heavy in the game
But I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out
But you just can't figure me out
Don't talk about it baby
Be about it
What you say you got
I already got it
You heavy in the game
But I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out
But you just can't figure me out

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Now you pull up in a truck
Tryna act like you don't see the Phantom
What?
(Am I killin' ya.)
Cause you act like a girl can't come up and run the club
(See nothin' new)
If you feel me all my ladies say
Fellas, change ya game
I'm just tired of hearing the same thang
(Oh)
See I need something different in my life, man
(Why you trying to figure out)
I'll just keep steppin'
(Think you be holdin' me down?)
Oh no, I don't think so
While you think about it, I'm already on the road

[Pre-Chorus: Destiny's Child]
(Oh no)
Cause I need you to offer me something new
Don't talk about rides cause I gots my own driver
Don't talk about trips cause I gots to make hits
When I'm done, I need someone to chill with
(oh no)
Don't talk about planes cause I gots my own pilot
Don't talk about bank, my accountant just wires it
Don't talk about gear cause I gots my own line
So don't get mad cause UPS is hiring

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Don't talk about it baby
Be about it
What you say you got
I already got it
You heavy in the game
But I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out
But you just can't figure me out
Don't talk about it baby
Be about it
What you say you got
I already got it
You heavy in the game
But I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out
But you just can't figure me out

[Bridge: Michelle Williams]
I can't believe you need a reason reason
I don't know just what you're thinkin'
I don't think you hear me
I need something real, see
Understand my plan is bigger than some house or GT Bentley yeah
Don't look at me crazy
I need more than just money
I just think you're caught up flaws
A man don't know a good thing
That's why I wanna school you
And let you know who's who
And I believe once you get hip on game, I think you know what to do
No talk about loving, what you can do for me

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Don't talk about it baby
Be about it
What you say you got
I already got it
You heavy in the game
But I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out
But you just can't figure me out
Don't talk about it baby
Be about it
What you say you got
I already got it
You heavy in the game
But I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out
But you just can't figure me out
Don't talk about it baby
Be about it
What you say you got
I already got it
You heavy in the game
But I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out
But you just can't figure me out
Don't talk about it baby
Be about it
What you say you got
I already got it
You heavy in the game
But I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out
But you just can't figure me out

Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is... So So Def
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom rosegold

[Verse 1: Nelly & Brandi Williams]
Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 more at the top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changing grills everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil mama love it
Cause when I...
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming (Say what)
Eyes stay low from the Chiefing (Chiefing)
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

[Hook: Brandi Williams, Nelly, Paul Wall, Nelly & Paul Wall]
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)

[Verse 2: Paul Wall & Jermaine Dupri]
What it do baby, it's the ice man Paul Wall (Yeah)
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball (Yeah)
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath (Already)
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating (What)
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating (Hah)
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (C'mon)
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman 'cause I'm selling everybody grills

[Hook: Brandi Williams, Nelly, Paul Wall, Nelly & Paul Wall]

[Verse 3: Ali, Big Gipp, Paul Wall]
Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em, on the top, on the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold
Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold

[Hook: Brandi Williams, Nelly, Paul Wall, Nelly & Paul Wall]
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I remember being young, tough, brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run this

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
Cause I put it down like that, d-down like that
And I'm making all these racks, a-all these racks
And I'm moving round like that, r-round like that
When I do it I don't look back, d-don't look back

[Chorus: Beyonce]
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
They love the way I walk
'Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk 'cause I ain't pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I'm goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, It's 'bout time I show it


[Chorus: Beyonce]
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
I'm a grown woman, and I know that I got it
I'm a grown woman, ain't got no room in my pockets
I'm a grown woman, look down, got you so excited
I really want to know if you got it like that
Cause I got a cute face and my booty so fat
Go girl, she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl, can get whatever she wants
That girl, she got that tight, that tight
Them boys, will do whatever what she likes

Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Payback is a bad chick
And baby, I'm the baddest
You messin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but no

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Verse 3: Lisa]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely

[Verse 4: Amy]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

[Verse 5: Lauren]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 6: Katherine]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse

[Verse 7: Lisa]
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 8: Katherine]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[Verse 9: Lauren]
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, You say I am Yours

[Verse 10: Katherine & (Lauren)]
And I believe (I can see your halo)
Oh I believe (I can feel your halo)
What You say of me (I can see your halo)

I got my angel now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away


[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo

[Verse 2]
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

[Verse 1]
Guess what I did today
Those were the words I said to you
It was last may, dont know the exact day
In my hand there was a ring
Then you told me that you loved me
More than anything in your life
So I asked you would you do me
The honor of being my wife

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yes I will
I will be your man
Your protector, your best friend
Till my humble life is ended
And time begins again, couldn't we be...

[Chorus]
Couldn't we be happily ever after?
We could be strong together for so long
My love is oh so strong
Couldn't we be happily ever after?
Couldn't we be?
Leaving you never till forever's gone

[Verse 2]
When I was away, mmm, mmm
Some friends became just faces
Some people grew apart
But you stayed right in my heart
And so many times
Pictured this day inside my mind
And for so many years, ooh
I knew it would be you here with me, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yes I will
Take you for my wife
The center of my life
And I will never, ever fade
From this choice I made, oh

[Chorus]
Couldn't we be happily ever after?
C'mon
We could be strong together for so long
Said my love is strong
Couldn't we be happily ever after?
Couldn't we be, babe?
Leaving you never till forever's gone
No no, Hey yeah

[Bridge]
You don't have to look no further than me
Don't look no more, baby yeah
You don't need much more than my lovin' to make you happy
I'm so happy, I'm so happy babe
Beneath the sight of God, I will make this vow to you, come on baby
I'll be right here, stay with me
Said I'll be here, baby hey

[Chorus]
Couldn't we be happily ever after
I said I wanna be, I said I wanna be
We could be strong together for so long
Couldn't we be happily ever after
Couldn't we be, babe?
Leaving you never till forever's gone
No, no I will never leave you, ooh
Couldn't we be happily ever after...
See today, I wanna make you my wife...

I woke up this morning, the sunshine was shining
I put on my happy face
I'm living, I'm able, I'm breathing, I'm grateful
To put on my happy face

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Woke up and realized this world's not so bad after all
Looked at it through a child's eyes, and I saw these beautiful
Things that you never think about
Like the ocean, moonlight, stars and clouds
It's amazing how we don't appreciate our blessings
There's plenty of people who don't like me
But theres ten times more who love me and I love myself
Sometimes, it gets tough, it gets tough
But I can't give up, can't give up
Just take a deep breath, close my eyes
Feel the love and give a smile

I woke up this morning, the sunshine was shining
I put on my happy face

It's me, I just wanna be happy
Uh, just be happy, uh, just be happy
Today is the day I am willing to say
I will put all the past behind me, no more enemies
Ready for the world (Ready for the world)
I'm living in this world (Living in this world)
I wanna make a change (Wanna make a change)
I'm gonna make a change (Gonna make a change)
Put on my happy face

Deena (The Dreams)
We didn't make forever
We've each got to go our seperate way
And now we're standing here, helpless
Looking for something to say
We've been together a long time
We never thought it would end
We were always so close to each other;
You were always my friend
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love
Hard to see you cry, my love
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
We didn't want this to happen
But we shouldn't feel sad
We had a good life together
Just remember, remember, all the times we had
You know I'll always love you
You know I'll always care
And no matter I'll far I may go
In my heart you'll always be there
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to see you cry, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
But we've got to grow
We've got to try
Though it's hard so hard
We've got to say goodbye
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(It's so hard, baby it's so hard)
Hard...

Part 1: Ghost

[Intro: Young Beyonce & (Presenter)]
(The winner is Beyonce Knowles: female pop vocalist!)
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston

[Verse 1]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

[Chorus]
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around


[Bridge]
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

[Outro]
Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm

Part 2: Haunted

[Verse 1]
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me


[Bridge]
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

[Verse 2]
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me

[Outro]
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
Me, me, me

[Verse 1]
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me

I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

Onto you, you must be on to me



[Kelly:]
I changed my life for you and all that you could do
Is betray me, how could you play me
You got me doing things I know I shouldn't do
Am I crazy to live this way see

I know I'm wrong, I'm shamed everyday
We're not as one, but you think it's okay
My life is not meant to be lived this way, this way
You promised me one day we would be
Husband and wife but it seems to me
You're moving further away from me, from me

[Chorus:]
Lord I'm trying to do what's pleasing in your sight
But I'm in love, right now I'm caught up
Instead of leaving, I know that you'll be right by my side
And you'll make a way, just have your way

[Beyonce:]
I spent too much time playin wife on many nights
Keepin you happy, giving you all of me
I wake up every morning feeling guilty cause you're lying next to me
Father forgive me, thought by now we'd be married

Four months ago you promised me
By now I'd have my wedding ring
You've shown no committment to me, to me
I cannot blame you for using me
If I continue to let this be
Cause shacking with a man just ain't me, ain't me

[Chorus (4x)]
Lord I'm trying to do what's pleasing in your sight
But I'm in love, right now I'm caught up
Instead of leaving, I know that you'll be right by my side
And you'll make a way, just have your way


[Chorus: Beyonce]
No need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
Already know you know about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
Watch your mouth when you're around us

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Pull up, hop out, wreck
Got no time, but we got Pateks
I come around, stepping on necks
My nigga got niggas upset, why?
Oh, why these bitches so mad for?
They don't want Yonce on their door
Louis Slugger to your four door
Careful, you get what you asked for
We go, go-oh
Go to Cuba then Aruba in the middle of the winter (skrt, skrt)
Brand new Sprinter, we laugh to the bank
But we ain't no joke, yeah
You better act like you know, yeah

[Chorus: Beyonce]
No need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us

Talk that talk, B

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Billie Jean in his prime
For the thousandth time, the kid ain't mine
Online they call me "dad," kiddingly
You're not supposed to take this dad thing literally
That's too famous, we don't even really do famous
I'm cool on that, chuck the two fingers
Everyday I'm gettin' sued famous
I show up to court without a suit famous
Your every move is on the news, ain't it?
Shit has its perks too, ain't it?
Shootin' videos in the Louvre, ain't it?
It could be far worse for you, can't it?
Pain comes with penthouse views, ain't it?
Bitch know me, I been me since the cocaine
Bitch know B, she don't even need a whole name

[Chorus: Beyonce & JAY-Z]
No need to ask, you heard about us
(It's Beyonce, nigga)

Already know you know about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
Watch your mouth when you're around us

And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
He smoke and we drink, D'USSE to the face
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Put hoes in their place, bitch stay in your lane

[Outro: Beyonce]
Yeah, we the ones that y'all heard about
Make big noise, big noise, we don't need no voucher
Yeah, we the one's y'all worried about
We good, we good, keep us out your mouth
If you don't know, now you know, nigga
If you don't know, now you know, nigga

I guess love just wasn't enough for us to survive
I swear, I swear, I swear I tried
You took the life right out of me
I'm so unlucky I can't breathe
You took the life right out of me, me, me, me
I'm longing for your heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat

[Verse 1]
I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving

[Chorus]
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you

We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed

[Chorus]
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

[Verse 1]
I love to see you walk into the room
Body shining, lighting up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what to say
The way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold

Baby, while I'm on my grind
And never would I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time and
You keep me humble out of this hype
'Cause you know there's more to life
And if I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

You're the air that I breathe to survive
Gotta hold you

Boy, without you my life just ain't the same
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you

[Verse 1]
I love the way you walk into the room
Body shining, lighting up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what to say
And the way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I get so excited when you travel with me
Baby, while I'm on my grind
Never would I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time
You keep me humble out of this hype
'Cause you know there's more to life
If I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

[Chorus]
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)

[Verse: Walter Williams Sr.]
Took me a while, but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about out my friends mouth
I've been beat down
Til he turned my life around
(turn my life around)

[Chorus: Walter Williams Sr.]
Seems like I always fall short, of being worthy
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shinin on me
(no no no no no)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
Loves me

[Verse: Beyonce + Choir]
I used to wake up somedays, and wish I'd stayed asleep
Cuz I went to bed on top of the world
Today the worlds on top of me
Everybody's got opinions (they share)
They ain't been in my position (they don't care)
That it breaks my heart when I hear what they
Have to say about me yeah (what they say)

[Chorus: Beyonce + Choir]
Seems like I always fall short (fallin short)
Of bein worthy (Lord I ain't worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough (no no)
But he still loves me (still loves me)
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me (but I want to be for you)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me

[Bridge: Choir]
I'm not perfect (I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong (yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best (trying my best but)
But it ain't good enough (just ain't good enough)
Shunned by the world (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed, cuz I ain't good
But he still loves me (I just ain't good enough)

[Verse: Choir + Beyonce]
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed
To be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cuz through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without out blame

[Chorus]
Feels like we always fall short, of bein worthy (we are not worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me
Cuz I ain't good enough, but you still love me

[Bridge]
I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm tryin my best but (tryin my best)
It ain't good enough (I'm not good enough)
Shunned be the word (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed (I don't succeed-ceed-ceed)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
(child sing with me)
I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm tryin my best but it ain't good enough
(But the Lord's been so good to me)
Shunned be the word (Shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
Cuz I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (The Lord still loves me)
No I ain't good enough, but He still loves me
(Raise your hands if ya understand)
No I ain't good enough (How he blessed you cuz he blessed you too)
But He still loves me (even though I ain't worthy)
No I ain't good enough (you ain't worthy, He's there for you)
But He still loves me (no matter what I do)
No I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (but the Lord still loves me)

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies
Why is it that men can go do us wrong?
Why is it that
We just decide to keep holdin' on?
Why is it that
We never seem to just have the strength to leave?
But he's got to go, he's got to go
Hey, ladies
Why is it that men can go do us wrong?
Why is it that
We just decide to keep holdin' on?
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength to leave?
But he's got to go, he's got to go

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
My man's been cheatin' on me
Been runnin' round here wit' this little tenderoni
And don't think I haven't noticed
He's been actin' funny
Takin' too long to call me
And somebody told me
That the worst thing of it all is that he gave her money
Now how he gonna give her my ends?
That's a no, no
My first reactions telling me he's got to go, go
But I just ain't for sure
Should I just let him go?
Oh, I don't know


[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, he did me wrong
But I love him so
I keep holding on
But he's got to go, he's got to go
Thought he was the one
But now, I don't know
After what he's done
He's got to go, he's got to go

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies
Why is it that men can go do us wrong?

Hey, ladies
Why is it that men can go do us wrong?

We just decide to keep holdin' on?
Why is it that we never seem to just have the strength to leave?
But he's got to go, he's got to go

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
You keep rewinding it
Stopping it, and playing yourself over again
See, I'm sick and tired of you doin' that same old thing
Sick of your same routine
Now you've got to come clean
'Cause it's killing me


[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, he did me wrong
But I love him so
I keep holding on
But he's got to go, he's got to go
Thought he was the one
But now, I don't know
After what he's done
He's got to go, he's got to go

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies
Why is it that men can go do us wrong?

[Breakdown: Beyonce]
I just don't understand
You get chance after chance
And you say that you'll do right
But I really do not know if you can
It's not in your plans
That you've shown
Can you change?
Don't think so
Now I gotta let you go
Got to go-go-go-g-go
Got to go-go-go-go-go

[Chorus repeat until fade]
Hey, ladies

[Commandment 9]
Thou shall move on to the next

[Intro: Big Boi]
Pure players
Pure players

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-cut-something
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian, but under the sheets
It's the player from the point
And your girl from the D

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Are you infatuated with me?
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move
I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my, my style is so crazy
I think you like it, baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me


[Chorus: Beyonce]
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love if I give you time?
I have none to waste with you
I guess you can say
My style is so crazy
I think you like it, baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star


[Break: Beyonce]
Undress me undress me
You can come
Come baby, undress me

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin' down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots in stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me "p" pop that thang
First check her brain to see if she's sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins man!

[Break: Sleepy Brown]
The way I feel
Oh girl I know its bout to be
Me all over you
And damn girl you all over me

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star





[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Outro]
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Intro: Jay-Z & Beyonce]
It ain't for everybody! (Uhh)
Welcome to Hollywood, baby (Take a picture)
Uh-huh, you coming with? (Let's not even talk about it)
Let's do it (let's go) uh-huh

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce & Jay-Z]
I see your jealousy as you watching (I see you watching me, baby)
You watching (it's all good)
It's kinda sexy to me how you watching (I love it)
You watching (Uh-huh, come on)

And let's discuss it (Let's chop it up)
Tonight you'll be, a superstar
Tonight you gonna be a superstar, baby
Come let me sign you up (Let's get into it)

[Chorus: Beyonce & Jay-Z]
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Satisfaction!)
You need that (Hollywood)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on


[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high-rise
I hide behind my shades cause the fame is blinding my eyes
My God, I know how Ozzie Oz
Once had felt when he was as high as I have got
I have got to make this stop
People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart
It'll change those who said they had love for you into strangers
When your fame starts, it's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when the train departs
Stranger, things have happened
Rapping, stacking, platinum plaquin'
Born in Brooklyn, got a place in Manhattan
Going back to Brooklyn to escape the madness
When your friends is, Chris and Gwyneth
When your girl is more famous than you then it's
Time to get all your windows tinted
Keep your eyes squinted, it's gon' flash any minute
The music biz is like musical chairs
It's about where you standing when the music stop spinning

[Chorus: Beyonce & Jay-Z]
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Satisfaction!)
You need that (Hollywood)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on


[Post-Chorus: Beyonce & Jay-Z]
You got to get it (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
Do you want it? (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
But you don't need it (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
What do you do? Oh oh oh oh
Now that you got what you want
What do you do? Oh oh oh, hey
Oh you want more?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Hey mister, pay six-a, a list-a, you're in the mist of
The ride of your life but you gotta keep them hits up
Can't put your guard down, gotta keep your mitts up
Take a sip, sir, it's so intoxicating, ain't it?
Try not to get jaded, Hollywood's been good to ya
Startin' feel like buzz to ya, don't lie
Gon' fly, you addicted to the lights
Without the fame how you gon' survive
It's like living on heroin, you so high

[Bridge: Beyonce & Jay-Z]
And everybody warning you about it (I tried to told you)
And once you taste, you can't live without it (It's addictive)
Not cause you choose to not live without it
You sure you want this, baby?
It's now a part of you, it's now a part of you (It's a part of you)
And everybody warning you about it
I see you changed, I see you blinded
And once you taste you can't live


[Chorus: Beyonce & Jay-Z]
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Satisfaction!)
You need that (Hollywood)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Wanna be seen, male groupies
Now you've become what you once despised
James Dean, John Belushi
Blow your whole life tryna live in the lights
Heroins following Marilyn
Hoppin' over the edge just like Janis Joplin
River Phoenix, Jimi Hendrix
Jimmy Morrison, all of them ended by
Hollywood, thank God for Hollywood
Hollywood, sure you want this baby?

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Hollywood
It's the most addicted drug in the world
Want the fame? You want the lights?
Hahaha

[Verse 1]
When I think of Home
I think of place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I was home
I wish I was back there
With the thing i've been knowing
Wind that makes the tall glass
Bend into leaning
Suddenly, the raindrops that fall
Have a meaning
Sprinklin the scene
Makes it all clean

[Verse 2]
Maybe there's a chance
For me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It sure would be nice
To be back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I
Can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time
In my life to grow up
Time, be my friend, let me start again


[Verse 3]
Suddenly, my world's gone
And changed It's face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space And yet, I've watched it growing
And if you're listening god, please, Don't make it hard
To know if we should believe the things That we see
Tell us, should we try to stay
Should we run away, or would it be Better just to let things be?

[Verse 4]
Living here in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy
But its taught me to love
So it real, real, real to me
And I've learned
That we must look inside our hearts
To find
A world full of love
Like yours, Like mine
Like Home

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
It's been a long year
And a lot has happened
But the time is here (Holidays)
See, I'm headed home
And I'm so excited
It's where I belong (Home for the holidays)

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
I can already see mama's Christmas tree
Surrounded by all the family
Presents everywhere and we're so happy
(Everything's just right)
I can already feel how it feels inside
Just to see my little nephew smile
The gifts that we bring only last a while
(Memories last lifetimes)

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
When I think of all the love
Bring all the joy (Holidays)
To just give more (Ring the phone)
I'm coming home for the holidays
When I think of all the smiles
I think of love
With all my family and friends (I'll be home)
I'm coming home for the holidays


[Verse 2: Kelly]
I hear people say, "Home is where the heart is"
I have to agree (Holidays)
When I step inside
See the Christmas lights
And the fire's bright
It makes my spirits rise

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
I can already see mama's Christmas tree
Surrounded by all the family
Presents everywhere and we're so happy
(Everything's just right)
I can already feel how it feels inside
Just to see my little nephew smile
The gifts that we bring only last a while
(Memories last lifetimes)

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
When I think of all the love
Bring all the joy (Holidays)
To just give more (Ring the phone)
I'm coming home for the holidays
When I think of all the smiles

With all my family and friends (I'll be home)
I'm coming home for the holidays


[Bridge: Michelle]
I'm going home
I'm coming home
I'm going home
I'm coming home
I'm going home
I'm coming home

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
I can already see mama's Christmas tree
Surrounded by all the family

With all my family and friends (I'll be home)
I'm coming home for the holidays

[Verse 1]
Hey, this is the story of a young'n dreamin'
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin'
Big city on his own shit
But every now and then a nigga get homesick
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling me, be warned
A lot of shit done changed in the time that you've been gone
The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner
And went and got babies the day they got they diploma
Damn, gon' be some niggas missing when you fly back
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq
Old buddy that we hoop with, with the bad chick and a fly 'lac
And a gold chain? Caught him on the Merc, tryna buy crack
Damn homie! Shit, in high school you was the man homie
The fuck happened to you?
Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school
Now you looking like a motherfucking fool

[Chorus]
Said I'll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city 'fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I'll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I'm coming home for the holidays

[Verse 2]
Hey, this is a story bout some puppy love
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love
Although now I'm on my grown shit
She bad as hell, a nigga still get home sick
I was fresh up off a scholarship
Dressed like a black man in college shit
Got a little knowledge now I'm following the politics
But I still gotta holla at my old chick
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it's me
She said "what, we ain't homies no more"
You go to college now you act like you don't know me no more
Girl please, we got history, semester seem so long
The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on
So if history repeats itself
When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gone need ya belt
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind
Just don't give it up in the meantime

[Chorus]
Said I'll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city 'fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I'll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I'm coming home for the holidays
Said I'll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city 'fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I'll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I'm coming home for the holidays

[Verse 3]
Man I reminisce on them school days
I know you know them act a fool days
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed
Trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly
But a nigga hella shy you would have thought that's where the bulls play
Was just a freshman could used a little Kool-aid (cool aid)
Crushing on them upper classmen but it was too late
Buddy she was dating, yeah, he had the freshest shoes
But the nigga graduated and he never made two A's
Hey if you're listening we got in school
But who will pay our tuition man
These niggas crazy
One year cost about same as a Mercedes (benz)
Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby
Ay maybe this ain't for me
Only if I could be LeBron and go straight to league
The worst part of growing up man: shit just ain't for free
Maybe I can be somebody people pay to see
And maybe I should move up out here to the place to be
To get from A to Z, aye what you think I'm crazy
If I told you one day that I'ma sign with Jay-Z
And will I make it man I guess we gotta wait and see

[Chorus]
Said I'll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city 'fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I'll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I'm coming home for the holidays




[Verse 1]
If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

[Chorus]
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

[Verse 2]
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

[Chorus]
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

[Bridge]
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know
I know

[Verse 3]
When I'm deep Inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
Because you're the one that I depend upon

[Chorus]
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you


[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I need to step out with no frustration
I need a permanent getaway vacation
They got a permanent hit list, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
50 did it right

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
I could've been homeless
I thought I moved to orphanage for the summer
I could've been homeless
Before I had a goal, I had a course

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga


[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
My people still dry snitchin' whenever they touch the mic
That's what happens when a therapist isn't somewhere in sight
Take flight, never leaned to the left, or the right
'Cause they turn the other cheek when our niggas start to die
When our women start to die, when our children start to die
I don't feel their empathy, we been displaced too many times
Every summer in the city start to feel like Columbine
'Cause you gotta get yours, and I gotta get mine
One time for the paragons of the paradigm
When you underground, they gon' only try to undermine
Use the track as a gymnasium to get into the stadium
You couldn't match my alien, I'm glowing like uranium

[Segue: Kevin Abstract and Dom McLennon, Beyonce]
One time for the- one time-
One time- nigga, one time- nigga

What if they don't want to come to the concert tonight? (Yes)
[Segue reversed] (Yes)

Smack that trick, smack that trick

Gold everything, gold ass chain
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the number one chick, I don't need no hype
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life

Screwed up captain, still repping the south
And can't none of y'all cut me off, I'm alive
Make 'em southside, cause that's Texas pride
Pimp C got me swangin' it wide, so be quiet
Bey still repping it right for H-Town
Don Keke's draped up, chopped and screwed down

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I've been on, I've been on
Since back when I had braids on my dome
Underground king, sitting on my throne
Me and Bey done did number one songs
Riding candy and chrome, this Texas
Could buy a Bentley cash with this necklace
This H-Town, we drive reckless
We make 'em bow down, they gon' respect us

[Hook: Beyonce]
I been on, I been on, I been on

You're plexing with Bey, you're plexing with me

But go to the pen, and be playing with them boys
They are not me, they're carbon copies
If God got me, who gon' stop me

[Verse 5: Z-Ro]
On, I could never be off
Hit the boulevard so hard, it'd never be soft
Elbows so long, looking like they reach out
Set of diamonds and gold in damn near each mouth
They call it Styrofoam City; Houston, Texas to be exact
Swangas on anything, it ain't gotta be a Lac
If I say I got sixteen, it ain't gotta be a rap
All them d-boys in them traps, they gotta feel that

[Verse 6: Bun B]
We the big ballers and big bodies in fresh foreigners
Fresh up off the road from hustling and rap touring
While you sleeping and snoring, we creeping and pouring
BaddieBey and the Bun, baby, you can't ignore 'em
Represent for Port Arthur, get it right off the water
How you want it hard or soft, put in your order
Never the hesitators, shaking off all the haters
Ridin' for Pimp, Screw and all the Lone Star Staters, hol' up

[Hook: Beyonce]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

Take me off, take me off, take me off

Didn't do your girl but your sister was alright, damn
In ya homeboy's Caddy last night man, haha
Hold up, Texas trill
H-Town going down, man

It's really been weighing on me
Tell me what did I do?
To have ya'll hatin on me
When I don't have nothin' to prove
Sometimes I shake my head
When I'm layin' down in my bed
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said
When you really don't know me yet

Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh


It's really been weighing on me
I'm not myself lately
I feel a little incomplete
But i'm not gonna lose no sleep
I keep it all in my mind
Cause it gotta get better in time
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine

Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh


Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know
Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know
Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know
Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

Leave me alone, leave me alone, just leave me alone, leave me alone ...



[Verse 1]
I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care?
Well, that's okay

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Verse 2]
Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry
And now everytime our love goes sour, you won't sympathize
You see these tears falling down to my ears
I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care?
That's okay

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Bridge]
Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you're just given up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

[Interlude]
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, whoa

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Outro]
I still care
I still care
I still care




[Verse 1]
I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care

I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care? Well, that's okay

You still don't care? Well, that's okay
Listen, hey

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Bridge]
Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you're just givin' up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

[Interlude]
Ooh, ooh, do-do-do do do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh, hey

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Outro]
I still care, baby
I still care, yeah
I still care
La-la-la, la-la-la




Feel like I'm loosing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe you belong to me
Oh oh
I'm going through difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesn't feel like this
This is my final wish

Hook:
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry

You know your not what I need
Let me go Let me do B

Chorus:
You've got me chasing after you like an
Ice cream truck

Verse 2:
Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
I'm chasing you again
Finally
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized the flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holdin on
It's good to know what's goin on

Hook:
The next your truck rolls by

Now it's time to let you go
Yes I try time and time again
You don't love me

[Verse 1: Michelle, Kelly, & Beyonce]
If I don't pick up the phone like I used to (for you)
Don't you take it personal
If I don't do all the things that I used to do (to you)
I ain't mad at you
If you get to feeling stressed up in your chest thinking that you about to lose (baby it's true)
And If you're losing out on sleep
Home worrying about me
That's how it be

[Chorus: All]
If you don't know now you know
You're gonna miss (my love)
And I ain't stressing 'bout a dog gone thing
Cause I was true when I gave you (my love)
If you search you will never find another love like (my love)
You're gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my (my love)
My love

[Verse 2:  Michelle, Kelly, & Beyonce]
If you think I caught a feeling when I heard about that other chick (No)
I already knew about it
I just needed time just to clear my mind and ask myself
(Why I didn't handle him)
If you woulda taken care of home instead of leaving me alone (I)
Still would be right there with you
Taking care of you
Steady loving you like I used to do

[Chorus: All]
If you don't know now you know
You're gonna miss (my love)
And I ain't stressing 'bout a dog gone thing
Cause I was true when I gave you (my love)
If you search you will never find another love like (my love)
You're gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my (my love)
My love

[Bridge: All, Michelle, & Beyonce]
There once was a time I blamed myself for what was wrong
(I can see so clearly now because you are gone)
That's how I spent all my time when you weren't home
(Playing around with them raggedy heifers)
There'll be no more stressing, no more crying, no more trying
I would rather be alone (I'd rather be all by myself, yeah)
Because this valuable heart of mine was yours until I realized
Finally opened my eyes

[Spoken: Kelly]
You see ladies?
I know I knew better
What was I thinking?
He gon' miss me when I'm gone

[Chorus: All]
If you don't know now you know
You're gonna miss (my love)
And I ain't stressing 'bout a dog gone thing
Cause I was true when I gave you (my love)
If you search you will never find another love like (my love)
You're gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my (my love)
My love


[Verse 1]
He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby

[Chorus]
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

[Verse 2]
Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you?
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby


[Chorus]
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

[Bridge]
Boy, when I try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
That's when its cool
But baby boy, I'm not a fool

[Chorus]
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me (Wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (No, no)
That your love was never true (No, no)
If you let him take me from you
(How could you let him take your woman?)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (Just let me go)
That your love was never true (Let me go)
If you let him take me from you (Just let me know)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you



[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Outro]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy...


If, if...
If I were a
If, if...
If I were a
If, if...
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a, were a...

[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me


[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed


[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a...
If I were a boy
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Boy...
If I were a boy



[Verse 1: Beyonce]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus: Beyonce]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
If you were a boy
Then, girl, you'd understand
You need to stop listenin' to your friends
Love, respect, and trust your man
So I go to clubs with the guys
And sometimes flirt with the girls
I should be able to roll out
As long as I'm comin' home to you
And give you the world

[Pre-Chorus: R Kelly]
But you're not a boy
So you don't have a clue, babe
How I work and pay the bills
How everything I do is for you
Hey, hey

[Chorus: Beyonce]
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Chorus 2: Beyonce (R. Kelly)]
If I were a boy (If I were a girl)
I would turn off my phone (I wouldn't play games)
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
(Girl, you know that's wrong)
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home

[Post-Chorus: R. Kelly]
But you're not a boy
So you can't understand
You are not a perfect woman
And I am not a perfect man

[Chorus: Beyonce & (R. Kelly)]
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts (And I know how you feel)
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed (Said I'm sorry)

[Bridge: Beyonce & R. Kelly]
It's a little too late for you to come back
But I can't let you go, 'cause I'm too attached
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Outro: Beyonce]
But you're just a boy




If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy

I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

But you're just a boy
Yeah, you don't understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy


If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home


If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy


I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive


[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

But you're just a boy
Yeah, you don't understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy



[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
If I were a lame
Only just for a week
I'd look myself in the mirror
And shoot the first thing I seen
No honestly I'd try and find someone else
And I'd make it seem like it's his fault
That I'm broke and can't get on
And he's doin' shit I can't do for myself

[Hook]
If I were a lame
I'd probably understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
Shit I'd say that I'd
Should be right in his place
And talk shit behind his back
But I'm smiling while I'm in his face
Cause I'm just a lame

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
If I were a lame
I'd talk shit to the hoes
Like you shouldn't fuck with that nigga
He ain't rich
I heard he really broke
I would get on a song
And talk as bad as I can
'Bout how I wish I'd catch him slippin'
How his mixtapes don't be shit
And how I'm gone end his career
But I'm his number one fan

[Hook]
If I were a lame
I'd probably understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
Shit I'd say that I'd
Should be right in his place
And talk shit behind his back
But I'm smiling while I'm in his face
Cause I'm just a lame

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
It's killin' me how niggas act anytime I come around
No matter how much I do for myself
They wanna bring me down
But I just gotta do me at the end of the day

Cause I'm not a lame
So I can't understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
No it ain't my fault
My shit flies off the shelf
So stop tryna be somebody
And worry about just bein' yourself
Nigga just be yourself

And don't be a lame
No don't be a lame


[Beyonce]
Sweetness flowing like a faucet, body bangin' no corset
Brother's wanna toss it but they lost cause my game made em forfeit
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse's
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I stick to my thesis, eyes stick to my features
Brother's try to hold but they game never reaches
And most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you lookin' at but what you lookin' at
We in a bar , wanna twist me like a bottle cap

[Mos Def]
I'm tryin' to holler miss to see if you gon' holler back

[Beyonce]
Your game is whack, and no, you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
Skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunking that

[Mos Def]
But this is Milla, Lieutenant if you're wonderin'

[Sam Sarpong]
And I'm Natheniel, (Mos Def) Mel Gibson (Sam) Danny Gloverin'

[Beyonce]
But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumb-l-in
See, I have dreams  and with a man, what will become of them?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should postpone my goals, cause he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down


[Mos Def]
I got a warrant for ya heart, in the bed, hold the trial

[Sam]
Get a pardon if ya come with the sargeant now

[Beyonce]
Give  the chair cause I don't care I ain't feelin' your style

[Hook x2]
Yo, I'm tryin' to get with you shorty
(But I'm not feelin' you)
But I'm an officer shorty
(My looks are killin' you)
Murder one will get you under the covers
(Game talker or manslaughter I ain't feelin' you brothers)

[Beyonce]
Eyes like the ocean

[Mos Def]
Ma I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise em' high and daddy long stroke em'

[Beyonce]
Hair like forever


[Sam]
I swear I could do it better
Take the gun out my holster, I still pack a baretta

[Beyonce]
You brothers sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing
But that kid

[Mos Def]
Don't waste ya time he ain't worth doin'
He just a sargeant, passin' out tickets for parking

[Sam]
Chickenheads cluckin'

[Beyonce]
Pitiful bulls barkin'
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as Marvin
I turn out lights with the switch when I'm walkin'
Girls steady jealous cause they man always hawkin'
Even got Lou lookin' at me like he stalkin'
And I got a mind too, I wouldn't bless you
If your first name was Ha-Chu, on Sunday singin' gospel

[Mos Def]
You ain't a dime just a nickel actin' hostile


[Beyonce]
Headed for the big top and bouncin' off this side show

[Chorus 1: Destiny's Child]
If you leave her, I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me

[Verse 1: Beyonce & Destiny's Child]
I peep game long time ago
When he told me, he's never seen that chick before
He wouldn't give me no explanation
'Cause he knows when I pack my bags
It ain't for no vacations ohh
I'm gonna do my thing
I'm leavin' his ass alone
(Oh, I'm gone; Oh, I'm movin' on my way)

[Verse 1: R.L. & Next]
I called 612-555-2422 to find you
I packed my bags, gassed up the Jag
And told my dad, you're the finest girl I never had
What's up my lady?
What's the message? Page me
Know it might sound crazy
But say you'll be my baby
She crushed my new Benz
Slept with my best friend
Spent all my ends
It's got to end

[Bridge: Beyonce, (Destiny's Child), R.L., (Next)]
Ooh, how do I know you won't hurt me like he has?

You've gotta have faith in me
You know I do I'd never play ya, baby
'Cause my love is all right (Is all you'll ever need)
'Cause I need someone for me
This love was meant to be
It's our destiny

Just run away with me, oh ho

Eight in the back, they rockin' hot jacks
In high heels, mini skirts and thighs fat
My styles like the international
Pancake house or whatever avenue

Think I need you cause the rent is due
You can be outta here baby
Cause I got it

Cause cash, coupes, credit cards
All the exotic things baby
I got it
I got it, I got it

[Amil]
Ever since cats found out I ran with the Roc
They wanna take a closer look, wanna examine the box
Magazine want cameras to pop
They catch me in the nude like a Samantha Fox
Listen dude but I got dollars and cents
You don't gotta promise me to pay my rent
I got that
(I got that)
Catch me a drop black playing Speedy Gonzalez
Toes never unpolished
The way I be dressing dudes wanna toss the salad
The way I be dressing got broads acting childish
But I pay my own bills
Amil-lion always has and always will
Y'all got that?

Repeat 1

[Beyonce']

The house that you live in

[Amil]
Yo my life's still on
Gas bill caught up
Indian Amil, call me chief running water
Cable still in order
Phone still dials out
Money still long but my patience got shorter
You can leave baby give me everything I bought you
Like you leaving me was some type of torture
I don't need no man to
Do for Amil what Amil can do
You got that?

Repeat 1 (2x)

That's right baby
Amil-lion, uh

Why ya runnin' away
When you're problem's gonna find you
Dry your eyes and take the time to pray

Everybody goes through things
Don't worry it will be OK
I know what you're goin through
Don't let it get the best of you
Everybody goes through change
And made it through yesterday

Whatever happen to livin' in a world of peace

Wantin' the same and we killin' one another for greed
And jealousy

Epidemic's got our nation dying young
Better be ready when He comes

[Sample: Wyclef Jean]
Went from a dream to the young Supreme

[Verse: Kelly]
Hey, yeah
Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place, another time
Touching many hearts along the way, yeah
Hoping that I'll never have to say

[Refrain: LaTavia]
Boy, I love you
But I gotta let you go
(Illusion)

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again
Daze in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Follow your emotions everywhere
Is there really magic in the air?
Never let your feeling get you down
Open up your eyes and look around


[Refrain: LaTavia]
Boy, I love you
But I gotta let you go

(Illusion)

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions

Daze in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Can it be a picture in my mind?
Never sure exactly what I'll find
Only in my dreams, I'll turn you on
Here for just a moment, then you're gone

[Refrain: LaTavia]
Boy, I love you
But, I gotta let you go
(Illusion)

My mind's playing tricks on me again

[Verse 3: Pras]
Yeah, yo, yo, yo, hey, yo
I don't write love songs
Leave it up to Luther Vandross
How I choose to live
You don't wanna know the cost
I paid to be the boss
Hear it straight from the source
Fortune 500 is how I like to gloss
High side, Korneesh Style, joy ride
Blowin' candles in the wind like Princess Di
Get at me, mom, tell me how you really like it
'Cause we could fly high, I'll be your co-pilot

[Bridge/Verse: LaTavia and Pras]
Hey, yo back to the girl with all the razzamatazz
(Hey, yo, I love you, shorty)
You talkin' all that jazz
Boy, I love you, but I gotta let you go
I know you want me, but you play me like the Lotto
Use and abusin' so there won't be no friction
I gotta leave, I can't be in this illusion
It's just an illusion


[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again
Daze in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

[Verse 1:]
It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me

[Chorus:]
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

[Verse 2:]
Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand


[Chorus:]
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

I thought that things like this get better with time but I still need you -why is that?
Your the only image in my mind so I still see you around
I miss you like every day, wanna be with yo but you're away
Said I miss you missing you insane but if I got with you would it feel the same?
Words don't ever seem to come out right but I still mean them -why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel but I still need too-why is that?
I miss you like every day, wanna be with yo but you're away
Said I miss you missing you insane but if I got with you could it feel the same?
It don't matter who you are it is so simple I feel it but its everything
No matter who you love it is so simple I feel it but its everything
I miss you like every day, wanna be with you but you're away (but you're away)
Said I miss you missing you insane but if I got with you would it feel the same?
T don't matter who you are it is so simple I feel it but its everything
No matter who you love it is so simple I feel it but its everything


[Verse 1]
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you, around

[Hook]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
If I got with you, would it feel the same

[Verse 2]
Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean them, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, now why is that?

[Hook]
Oh it's cause I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, I miss you insane
But if I got with you, would it feel the same

[Verse 3]
And it don't matter who you are
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything

You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you around

The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
Why is that?

[Chorus: Beyonce]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?


[Bridge: Beyonce]
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

[Chorus: Beyonce]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away (But you're away)
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

[Bridge: Beyonce]
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

Cameron D. and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, come on
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always 50-50 in relationships

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly and Farrah]
The shoes on my feet, I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing, I bought it
The rock I'm rocking, I bought it
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing, I bought it
The house I live in, I bought it
The car I'm driving, I've bought it
I depend on me (I depend on me)


[Chorus]
All the women, who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys, who making money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas, who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies, who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

[Bridge]
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

[Verse 2]
Tell me how you feel about this
Do what I want, live how I wanna live
I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get
Ladies, it ain't easy being independent
Question, how'd you like this knowledge that I brought?
Bragging on that cash that he gave you is to front
If you're gonna brag, make sure it's your money you flaunt
Depend on no one else to give you what you want


[Pre-Chorus: Kelly and Farrah]
The shoes on my feet, I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing, I bought it

The house I live in, I bought it
The car I'm driving, I've bought it

Our objective of this meeting today is to discuss
Destiny's Child's Commandments of relationships

[Kelly]
You know it's so unfortunate, so unnecessary
For us to end up with broken hearts

[LaTavia]
Yes, Godfather
Times have changed
Relationships aren't like the old days
You know?

[LeToya]
See what we need is a man of his word
All this, uh, cheating, uh, backstabbing, uhm, hating
No more, no more

[LaTavia]
But, Godfather
How do we avoid all these mishaps?

[Beyonce]
It's obvious
The Writing's On The Wall;
Thou shall not hate

Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (Baby)
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags (You must not know about me)
We're finished (You must not know about me)
'Cause you made your bed
Now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

Baby you dropped them keys hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah & Beyonce]
Ayo love you need to calm down over something small
Word, you had to flip, that girl ain't mine
She a custie, word life, she love my shit
I know Kianna told words, she saw us both in the whip
Not mine in the business, ugly self with a flat ass
I know that's your friend, but you first need a man
And regardless to what I do
I'mma stay on my grind, bust my heat and make sure there's food
When we can't stand the rain in the rolex now
And we feeling like a shell jammed up in a barrel
All we gotta do is talk this out
Now you tell me who that man that got hard who set foot in this house
Girl you must not know bout me
That shiny thang in the room gon pluck a tree
And don't make this the reason I ain't touch you in eight days
I thought you was on your friend, thanks, he was leaving you mad late
You pulling out your hair, you scratch my face
Rip my rhyme book's wilding, and you trashed the place
This is unjustifiable
I'mma do these dishes and wash my ass cus I ain't gotta lie to you
Cus I ain't gotta lie to you
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)


[Bridge: Beyonce]
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I thought that this was something, yes
Promising that one day it would turn into something, yes
Thought the feelings were mutual
And I didn't have to guess
Started being skeptical
Always unavailable
Like you didn't know
But now I'm feeling something, else
That's telling me this may not be the real something, else
But you was showing me
Now I'm ready and you running
Damn you got me open now
Feeling like I'm choking now
Where am I to go?

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly]
I can't believe that you can't feel my heart
And I can't believe you let me fall so hard
Stop playing, how could you let it go this far?
If you had doubts that I wasn't the one
You said that you're the type to take it slow
You said before I step I'll let you know
Stop playing Before you let me see you with her
You could have told me a change was gon' come. yeah


[Chorus: Beyonce ]
Is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
Fall through my hood like you use to?
Or put it on me hard like you use to do?
I feel in my mind what's going on
But my heart won't let me go until I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
The deepest of my love couldn't please you?
Or bring it to me home like you use to do?
Seeing her falling for your charms
Got me feeling like I wasn't good enough

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
See I know we're not official, no
But us being official ain't ever been an issue, no
It came down to us, boy
Remember we were different?
We said that we'd talk if we ever had problems about anything
I was cool with no commitment, wait
Let me take that back
It was you so I was with it, see
I guess I didn't get when you showed you didn't miss it
Now it seems that your interest ain't here
We ain't the same

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly]
I can't believe that you can't feel my heart
And I can't believe you let me fall so hard
Stop playing, how could you let it go this far?
If you had doubts that I wasn't the one
You said that you're the type to take it slow
You said before I step I'll let you know
Stop playing Before you let me see you with her
You could have told me a change was gon' come. yeah

Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
The deepest of my love couldn't please you?
Or bring it to me home like you use to do?
Me seeing her falling for your charms
Got me feeling like I wasn't good enough

[Bridge: Michelle]
All you had to say was this ain't what you want
I won't be so hurt and I could just move on
You had me believing everything was my fault
But I can see it now
It's a situation that I must let go
Cause you ain't gonna be a man and let me know
I guess me seeing you with her tells it all

[Chorus: Michelle]
Is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
Fall through my hood like you use to?
Or put it on me hard like you use to do?
I know in my mind what's going on
But my heart won't let me go until I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
The deepest of my love couldn't please you?
Or bring it to me home like you use to do?
Me seeing her falling for your charms
Got me feeling like I wasn't good enough


[Chorus: Beyonce]

Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
The deepest of my love couldn't please you?
Or bring it to me home like you use to do?
Seeing her falling for your charms
Got me feeling like I wasn't good enough



[C.C., spoken]
Effie? Curtis was supposed to--

[EFFIE, spoken]
Love me! Curtis was supposed to love me!

[CURTIS, spoken]
There you are, Effie. I've been looking all over

[EFFIE]
I turn my back and find myself out on the line
You could've warned me but that would've been too kind

[CURTIS]
I've been warning you for months to clean up your act
You've been late, you've been mean
Giving all kinds of bullshit flack

[EFFIE]
That's a lie! That's a lie!
It's just I haven't been feeling that well

[CURTIS]
Effie, please, stop excusing yourself
You've been late, you've been mean
And getting fatter all the time

[EFFIE]
Now you lying, you lying
I've never been so thin
You lying, you lying
'Cause you knocking off that piece who thinks she's better than everybody
She ain't better than anybody
She ain't nothing but common

[DEENA]
Now who you calling common, you self-indulgent
Self-absorbed non-professional?

[EFFIE]
You! I'm calling you!
I'm calling you the common piece he's knocking off

[DEENA]
Now you listen to me, Miss Blame-It-on-the-World
See, I've put up with you for much too long
I have put up with your bitching
I've put up with your nagging
And all your screaming too!

[LORELL]
Oh, now, when are you two gonna stop all this fighting?

[EFFIE, spoken]
Stay out of this, Lorell, this is between Deena and me!

[LORELL]
Yeah, well, it's between me too
I'm as much a part of this group as anybody else
And I'm tired
Effie, I'm tired!
Of all the problems you're making us

[EFFIE]
I always knew you two were together

[LORELL, spoken]
What?!

[EFFIE]
I always knew you two were ganging up on me!

[DEENA]
She had nothing to do with this change
It was you! It was you always thinking of you
Always thinking of you!

[CURTIS]
I knew you were trouble from the start

[EFFIE, spoken]
Trouble?

[CURTIS]
You were real bad trouble from the start

[EFFIE, spoken]
Curtis, I'm your woman

[CURTIS]
But you're getting out now
I'm not building this group to have you tear it apart
Go 'head and rant and scream and shout!
Don't worry, baby, I'll buy you out

[EFFIE, spoken]
There's no money dirty enough to buy me out! You remember that, Curtis!

[C.C.]
Lay off, Effie!
Just take the money and run

[EFFIE, spoken]
You in this with them, C.C.?

[C.C.]
Cool it, Effie
This time you know what you've done

[EFFIE, spoken]
So they bought your black ass too, huh?

[C.C.]
I said cool it, Effie!
This time you've gone too far!

[EFFIE, spoken]
Oh, I can go further, I can go further

[MICHELLE]
I don't wanna stay around this
I'm just breaking into this business
This is between all of you
This is none of my affair

[EFFIE]
Yeah, well, it's between you too now, li'l sister
This snow job is as much your sin
Look at me! Look at me!
How much did you put out to get in?

[MICHELLE]
Now you watch your mouth
Watch your mouth, Ms. Effie White!
'Cause I don't take that talk from no second-rate diva
Who can't sustain!

[EFFIE]
I'm not feeling well
I got pain

[ALL except EFFIE]
Effie, we all got pain

[EFFIE]
Oh, for seven years, I sung with you
I was your sister

[ALL except EFFIE]
You were our trouble

[EFFIE]
And now you're telling me it's all over?

[ALL except EFFIE]
And now we're telling you it's all over

[EFFIE]
And now I'm telling you I ain't going

[ALL except EFFIE]
It's all over

[EFFIE]
I ain't going

[ALL except EFFIE]
It's all over


Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta, gotta be where you are
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
Yeah, yeah, baby now
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
Na, na, yeah, yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh I
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
Na, na, baby
I wanna be, I wanna be, I



[Verse 1: Eddie Murphy (The Dreams)]

And I need you baby (I need you)
Oh baby, you got me on my knees (got me on my knees)
You got me baby baby baby (Baby)

[Verse 1]
I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget

[Chorus]
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

[Verse 2]
I wanna say I lived each day, until I die
And know that I meant something in, somebody's life
The hearts I have touched, will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see

[Chorus]
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

[Bridge]
I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone some happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I was here

[Chorus]
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived (I lived), I loved
I was here
I did (I did), I've done
I was here
I lived (I lived)
I loved (I loved)
I was here
I did, I've done
I was here




[Verse 1]
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And now you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that there look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I'll survive
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I asked the Lord, give me strength and not let me fall apart
I tried hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent so many nights feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And now you see me, somebody new
I'm not that tender little person still swept for you
So you felt like dropping by, and you expected me to be free
Well, I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to crush me with goodbyes?
Did you think I'd crumble? Ha ha ha
You think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, oh no, I will survive
As long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
I...I will, I will

[Bridge]
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I'm not gonna stop, I'm gonna get stronger
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I'm not gonna stop, I'm gonna get stronger
I'm a survivor, I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gonna stop, I'm gon' work harder

(Ooh) Are you listening? (Listen here)
Now you know it took all of the strength that I had not to fall apart
I kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
But I will survive
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
I tried hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
I spent so many nights feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, yeah, but now I hold my head up high
And now you see me, somebody new
I'm not that tender little person still in love with you
Oh, so you felt like stopping by and expected me to be free?
Yeah, well, I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me
Beat it! (Beat it!) Get to steppin'! (Get to steppin'!)
Keep it movin' (Keep it movin')
Get on down the road, alright? (Get on down the road)
Weren't you the one who tried to crush me with goodbyes?
Did you think I'd crumble? Ha ha ha ha
You thought I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no (Oh no), this is me (I will survive)
As long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Hey hey...hey, ooh...

Watch your back and just do what you supposed to
Take care of family and people you're close to

[Verse 1]
I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"

[Verse 2]
Take it one step further, freakum dress out my closet
Yonce fillin' out this skirt, I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex, said what up to his besties
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous


[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"

[Bridge]
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human, don't judge me

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

Queen B I'm tripping 'cause I'm a little insecure when your phone go off
'Cause they be calling at 3 in the morning
Know I do the same shit but girl, it's different
And if I can't, you can't fuck with no exes
You got me, no need for extras, you just love making me jealous
Hanging out with your girls all night and staying out 'til tomorrow
Girl, you got me all kinda crazy, sipping all on that bottle
I see you tryna flex, so mad I'm drunk texting
Now I'm reminiscing how we fell in love in Texas, girl, I'm jealous

If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine (Oh woah)

[Verse 1: Beyonce, Carrie Underwood]
The heart is stronger than you think
It's like it can go through anything
And even when you think it can't
It finds a way to still push on, though
Sometimes you wanna run away
Ain't got the patience for the pain
And if you don't believe it, look into your heart
The beat goes on, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Sheryl Crow, Beyonce]
I'm tellin' you, things get better, through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle?
You need to know, ooh yeah

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow, with Beyonce]
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up
Through it all, just stand up!


[Verse 2: Fergie, Leona Lewis, Keyshia Cole]
Ooh, it's like we all had better days
Problems getting all up in your face
Just because you go through it
Don't mean it gotta take control, no-oh-oh
You ain't gotta find no hiding place
Because the heart can beat the hate
Don't wanna let the mind keep playin' you
And sayin' you can't go on

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, LeAnn Rimes, Natasha Bedingfield, (Carrie Underwood)]

Tick tock, pretty baby
You can get it back, don't you waste it
To grow from your past, gotta face it
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Tick tock, pretty baby (Tick tock, pretty baby)
You can get it back, don't you waste it (Get it back, don't you waste it)
To grow from your past, gotta face it

'Cause you're the key to the kingdom

[Outro: Tiwa Savage]
See how the sun and the moon bow for you?

Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohhh

Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same as last night
And you just don't feel right anymore
I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight
I? M just tired and I need a change

Sorry boy, but you got me bored, something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied for a little while
I gotta

Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out


Kick him out

Kick him out
Kick him out

Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else that I like
I really thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohhh

You call me too frequently
I thought it was so sweet in the beggining
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how I like it (trifling)
That's reason in up your times expire

Sorry boy, but you got me bored, I gotta move around
If I ain't gotta a ring by now that means I'm not tied down
I gotta


Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out

Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out

Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else that I like
I really thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohhh

I gotta
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out
Switch him out


Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out
Kick him out

Ohhh
I know that you treat me right
But still I thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
And I think you're nice
But still I see something else that I like
I really thinking I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ohh

[Chorus]
You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all o' that
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
Let's go, let's go little kitty cat
I think it's time to go
Let's go little kitty cat
He don't want no mo'
Let's go little kitty cat
Quite frankly: no more givin' it
I'm not feelin' it

[Verse 1]
It's like we at two places, but different paces
We in trouble, but you won't meet me at the bridge
It hurts, it feels deserted
Did you forget where your heart lives?

[Pre-Chorus]
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty


[Chorus]
You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all o' that

Quite frankly: no more givin' it

[Verse 2]
(Let me show you how to get there)
Take a left to compassion (Lights will be flashin')
Keep straight and you'll see the sun right there
Affection (You're in the wrong direction)
If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care

[Pre-Chorus]
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body
Acting like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty


[Chorus]
You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home (said that you would soon be home)
But baby, that was a long time ago

How you gon' neglect this? You is just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie Craig


[Pre-Chorus (Variation)]
What about my body, body?
What about by my body, body?
I'm in the house all alone, you rather go and party?
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm nobody
You gon' make me call somebody

Do, do, do, do, hey...

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I like the way I feel
The way you keep it real
So many simple things
That you don't know the joy you bring
I like how you and me work
When we hang out we're so happy
I never want it to end
I know that we'll always be down and be together
Cause that's how I want to be

[Chorus]
Any time you're feelin' down
I will always be around
Know that (I'm always for you)
You know that
You don't have to go nowhere
I will always be right here
Know that (I'm always for you)
You know that

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I'm crazy 'bout the way
You let me do my thing
So many reasons why (So many reasons why)
I want you in my life
I like how you and me
No doubt about
We're were meant to be
I never want it to end


I know that we'll always be down and be together
That's how I want it to be
So

You know that

Yes! So crazy right now
Most incredibly
It's your girl b
It's your boy young
History in the makin'
Part 2
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two,three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Yeah, cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now
(your love)
Got me lookin' so crazy right now your touch's
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
(your touch)
Got me hoping you page me right now your kiss's
Got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy your love's got me lookin'
Got me lookin' so crazy your love
When I talk to my friends so quietly
"who he think he is?" look at what you've done to me
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
Yeah, but I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now
(your love)
Got me lookin' so crazy right now your touch's
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
(your touch)
Got me hoping you page me right now your kiss's
Got me hoping you save me right now
Lookin' so crazy your love's got me lookin'
Got me lookin' so crazy your love
I'm warmed up now
Let's go
Young Hova
Y'all know when the flow is loco
Young b and the r-o-c uh oh
O-g, big homie
The one and only
Stick boney but the pockets are fat like tony
Soprano the Roc handle
Like Van Exel
I shake phonies man, you can't get next to
A genuine article, I do not sing tho
I sling though, if anything I bling yo
Star like Ringo
War like a green berret
You're crazy bring your whole set
Jay-z in the range
Crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out
They're like "hey is he insane?"
Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, I'm chinchilla
I've been I'll of the chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova
I've been reala'
The game's over
Fall back young ever since
I made you change over to platinum
The game's been a wrap
One
Got me looking so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately
I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playin' myself
Baby I don't care
'Cause your love got the best of me
And baby you're makin' a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me so crazy
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now

Got me lookin' so crazy right now your touch's
Got me lookin' so crazy right now

Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face

All of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always here to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
For my babe

Just come and lay up under me!

[Outro: Beyonce]
I feel we made something that made my daughter proud
Made my mother proud, my father proud, and all of the people
That are my brothers and sisters around the world
And that's why I live
I'm so lucky and grateful that I'm able to
Take all these crazy ideas and actually make it into somethin' that
Heals people and that may spark vision in people
That shows them to dream big
And shows them that they are limitless
It's possible
If my country ass can do it, they can do it



Lift every voice and sing
'Til earth and Heaven ring
Ring with the harmonies of liberty
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the list'ning skies
Let us march on 'til victory is won

[SUNSHINE]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete

Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh!
Now that I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what
You've made of me

I followed the voice, you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened


There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh!
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what
You've made of me

I followed the voice, you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own


I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Oh! Now I am done believing you
You don't know not what I am feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me

But now I got to find my own
My own



[Verse 1]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I found the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened

[Verse 2]
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

[Bridge]
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

[Chorus]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own


[Verse 1]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

If you don't, if you won't

[Chorus]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'

But now I've gotta find my own, my own

Our finest gifts we bring

Where you goin'? You can't leave me, girl, I love you

[Lorrell Robinson, singing]
And Lorrell loves Jimmy
Lorrell loves Jimmy
Lorrell loves Jimmy, it's true
But Lorrell and Jimmy are through

I got a show to do, remember, baby?
Oh baby, I got a show to do


[Announcer]
And now, please welcome the brightest star in the Rainbow Constellation, Deena Jones and the incredible Dreams!

[Deena Jones]
I, I
Hello, America. What a wonderful evening
I love you all
Curtis, baby, this is for you
We are a family
Like a giant tree
Branching out toward the sky
We are a family
We are so much more
More than just you and I
We are growing free



[Intro: Michelle]
Hit me!

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]

Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (Hah Hah)

Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (Hah Hah)

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Oooh!
I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like ya don't know what to do
After I done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast baby now I can't find you
Oooh!
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like it can't come through
All them lies like you could satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (Hah Hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (Hah Hah)

[Verse 2: Kelly]
Oooh!
Two things I don't like when I tryin' to get my groove
Is a partna that meets me only half way and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Oooh!
You understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference of a man and an adolescent
It ain't you, boo, so get to steppin'!

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (Hah Hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (Hah Hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (Hah Hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (Hah Hah)

[Bridge: Michelle & All]
If you can't make me say 'oooh'
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some and you really want none
If you can't make me say 'oooh'
Like the beat of this groove
(You don't have no business in this here's your papers
Baby you are dismissed, dismissed, dismissed....)

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (Hah Hah)

Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (Hah Hah)

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Michelle Williams, Beyonce]
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (Hah, hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath

[Bridge: Michelle Williams & All]
If you can't make me say "ooh"
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some?
You ain't really want none
If you can't make me say "ooh"
Like the beat of this groove
You don't have no business in this
Here's your papers, baby, you are dismissed

[Outro: Beyonce, Michelle Williams & Kelly Rowland]
Everybody give it up for the beautiful Kelly, and the beautiful Michelle
We love you
My girl Bey is killin' it tonight
I'm so happy y'all are here tonight
Do y'all remember this song?



[Intro]
OMG, you done lost yo' motherfreakin' mind!

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

[Verse 1]
I could shed so many tears
But I won't let you see me crying
Now it all adds up
Even the numbers
Let me exactly hear
But you you wonder
I know how my mama felt
Getting ran over
But this ain't a cycle here
This one is over
Something told me to check my time
If I'm the one that's always crying

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
I could've told ya
It's all in the atmosphere
I can't control ya
But I'm not a pushover no more

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

[Verse 2]
You could shed so many tears
But you won't let me see you crying
If she really loves ya
Than that's what ya need to build
I'm more than your woman
I know you don't love her
I painted it for ya
But you picked the colors
At night you'll get over
Yeah, like you will never
I trusted you through all these years
And I'm the one that's always crying

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
The melody told ya
Exactly the pain I feel
Reap what you sow, boy
I'm not a pushover

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (You lost it)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

[Bridge]
I always knew you were counterfeit
That's what you get
I see you crying
Excuses after excuses
Pretending that we exclusive
I stuck around all these years
I dried and cried all your tears
I trusted you despite my fears
And I refuse to keep on trying

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that it's over
I can move over
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
You just confirmed it
This ain't a warning
Been living a double life
You must have lost yo mind

[Chorus]
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
(You crazy!)
You must've just lost yo mind
(You crazy!)
They told me 'bout all the lies
(You lost yo mind!)
I took you back all those times
(Tell ya one more time!)
You must have lost yo mind!
(You lost yo mind!)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine
(It was not mine!)
Many earrings must I find?
(Hey!)
You must've just lost yo mind
You just lost yo mind




[Verse 1: Beyonce]
It had been many years since I'd been in love
With a real man, I had given up on love
I didn't think a good man existed in this world
I was tired of searching
Because relationships I dealt with in the past
Couldn't fathom being monogamous
And when I least expected it, I found you
And because of you I know how it feels to be

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
Love, and when I look into your eyes I see
Love, pillow talk at night and I can hear your
Love, the next morning we make
Love, I'm so in love

[Chorus]
Through you I live and love again
Open the path to happiness
Through you I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand
Through you I learned to smile again
I love you, (i love you)I love you (i love you)

[Verse 2: Kelly]
Now it's been three years since we've been in love
And you keep doing things to show you're proud of
Thirty beauties in the room, only me you see
The confidence you give lives in me
I vow to never break your heart, I'll never let you down
For better or worse, I'll always be around
And with you here to share, my life's so complete
And because of you I know how it feels to be

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
Love, and when I look into your eyes I see
Love, pillow talk at night and I can hear your
Love, the next morning we make
Love, I'm so in love

[Chorus]
Through you I live and love again
Open the path to happiness
Through you I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand
Through you I learned to smile again
I love you, (i love you)I love you (i love you)

[Bridge: Michelle]
I thank God for you
Your love's amazing
And like the rain it fell on me
Wanting it more and more
Cause your love's in the air I breathe
Lying beside me
You see into the soul of me (You see into the soul of me)
And your spirit sets me free

[Chorus x2]
Through you I live and love again
Open the path to happiness
Through you I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand
Through you I learned to smile again
I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you)

Through you I live and love again
Open the path to happiness
Through you I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand
Through you I learned to smile again
I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you)

[Verse 2: Beyonce and Kelly]
Now it's been three years since we've been in love
And you keep doing things to show you're proud of
Thirty beauties in the room, only me you see
The confidence you give lives in me
I vow to never break your heart, I'll never let you down
For better or worse, I'll always be around
And with you here to share, my life's so complete
And because of you I know how it feels to be

[Chorus x2]
Through you I live and love again
Open the path to happiness
Through you I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand
Through you I learned to smile again
I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you)




[Hook]
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, (things you need to know)

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige (Beyonce)]
A woman, she needs more than material things
And a woman needs so much more that what a man can say
(A woman, needs you to make love to her, she needs more than sex
A real woman needs a real man that don't talk about it
Be about it
Put that work, and still shows his woman real romance)

[Hook]
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, (things you need to know)

[Verse 2: Beyonce (Mary J. Blige)]
A woman, she likes to talk and work it out
And a woman likes for you to watch her back
Protect her crown
(A woman don't only want your make-up sex
She wants your respect
And a real woman never wanna walk into a room
See another woman knowing information
She don't even know about her man)

[Hook]
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, (things you need to know)

[Verse 3: Beyonce (Mary J. Blige)]
Make your way home at a decent hour every night
(Pick up your phone
Just to say you're still in love from time to time
Remind her that she's still beautiful in your eyes
And ride with your woman
Make her feel that you're always on her side
When she cries, ask her what she's feeling
Let her know you sympathize)

[Bridge: Beyonce and Mary J. Blige]
Gotta swallow your pride
Got some making up to do, gotta make it right
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Gotta take you time
I said kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Say it one more time, say it one more time
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Gotta take your time
Don't want a minute man
We wanna have fun until she finish man
If that's asking to much
You'll never know how to really
Love a woman

[Hook]
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, (things you need to know)

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Ohhh
You think you know how to love a woman?
Ohh no...no


[Verse 1]
Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

[Verse 2]
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?


[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
And you, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought

[Outro]
You, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought
You, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought



Pt. 1 Love Drought

[Intro: Lemonade Speech]
Do you remember being born?
Are you thankful for the hips that cracked, the deep velvet of your mother
And her mother and her mother?

You look nothing like your mother,
You look everything like your mother.
You desperately want to look like her.
How to wear your mother's lipstick
You must wear it like she wears disappointment on her face.

Your mother is a woman,
And women like her can not be contained.

I think of lovers as trees
Growing to and from one another,
Searching for the same light.
Why are you afraid of love?
I think it's not possible for someone like you.
But you are the love of my life (the love of my life)

[Verse]
Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough

[Chorus]
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now (make it rain now)
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Pt. 2 Sandcastles

[Intro: Lemonade Speech]
If we're gonna heal
We gonna start again,
You are the magician pulling me back together again,
The way you cut me in half.

Make the woman in doubt disappear.
Her heaven would be a love without betrayal.
You look nothing like your mother,
You look everything like your mother.

[Verse]
We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no no no no no
Every promise don't work out that way

[Outro]
There is a curse,
That will be broken.
One thousand girls raise their arms.
Now that reconciliation is possible,
If we gonna heal,
Let it be glorious.


[Verse 1: Beyonce & JAY-Z]
Happily in love, haters please forgive me
I let my wife write the will, I pray my children outlive me
I give my daughter my custom dresses, she gon' be litty
Vintage pieces by the time she hit the city, yeah-ah
Vintage frames, I see nobody fuckin' wit' him
Pretty thug, out the third ward, hit me
Sir acts just like his dad, shit is trippy (uh-huh)
Twinning, Blue and Rumi, me and Solo how fitting
(Happy in love)
Sitting, dock of the bay wit' a big yacht
Sippin' Yamazaki on the rocks
He went to Jared, I went to JAR out in Paris
Yeah, you fucked up the first stone, we had to get remarried
Yo, chill man! We keepin' it real with these people, right?
Lucky I ain't kill you when I met that b- (Nah, aight, aight)
Y'all know how I met her, we broke up and got back together
To get her back, I had to sweat her
Y'all could make up with a bag, I had to change the weather (uhh)
Move the whole family West, but it's whatever
In a glass house still throwing stones
Hova, Beysus, watch the thrones
(Happy in love)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You did some things to me
Boy, you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain
And I believe you can change, baby
The ups and downs are worth it
Long way to go, but we're workin'
We're flawed, but we're still perfect for each other, baby, you
Sometimes, I thought we'd never see the light
We went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night
(Happy in love)


[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Beyonce]
No more clubs and Cali-curfews (one night)
Just private affairs in a tighter circle
Large format wines in small settings, woo
Just hood ass niggas in designer suits (ooh)
Follow my moves on a truth in Alaia boots, yeah, yeah
Amelia Earhart, flyer than who? (yeah, yeah)
Fake news y'all choose, we no lie
No photoshop, just real life
(Happy in love)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You did some things to me
Boy, you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain
And I believe you can change, baby
The ups and downs are worth it
Long way to go, but we're workin'
We're flawed, but we're still perfect for each other, baby, you
Sometimes, I thought we'd never see the light
We went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night
(Happy in love)

[Outro: Beyonce]
Damn, look at us now
Pray, pray for the vows
Way up now, it's a long way, a long way down
We came, and we saw, and we conquered it all
We came, and we conquered, now we're happy in love
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)

She the queen, came right back
Listen to me
Yeah, yeah
Oh, remix

[Verse 1: Usher & Beyonce]
Now, baby girl, there ain't nothing more that I can say
You know by now, I want it more than anything
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody
I know you want it (Yeah)
But I'm hesitating (Why?)
You must be crazy, I got a man, you got a lady
I know, we here together, so this must be something special
'Cause you could be anywhere you wanted

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
Don't be shy, come let your boy get in
So you can tell all of your friends
You was on the remix, like...

[Chorus: Usher]
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watching, I ain't stopping
Baby, I don't give up
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watching
Baby, I don't give up in this club

[Verse 2: Beyonce, Usher & Both]
Baby, you know I'd be down
But we can't have all these people staring, standing around
This right here is only for your eyes to see
But you getting carried away, saying we can do it wherever
The way you touching me like no other
I'ma make you feel insane
Trying your hardest to make me give in
But I'ma be down to give you whatchu wanting if you keep it up
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up
And I don't want security rolling up on us (I got you)
I'm not hesitating, I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
I guess if I mess around and let you get in
You gon' tell all of your friends
You was on this remix, like...

[Chorus: Beyonce, Usher & Both]
In this club, in this club
Fellas, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watching, I'm stopping
Baby, I don't give up in this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watching
Baby, I don't give up in this club

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Shawty want a thug
It started with a hug
And the rest went like this
I gave her neck, a kissy-kiss
She gave my neck a kiss back
I said, we could do it like a stack
I mean, we could do it like a G
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty, we could get it on
I'm like, shout out to the DJ for playing this song
Girl, we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doing a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl
And it started with a hug
But now we making love in this club
And we're not gonna stop just because
The people in the crowd are watching us
But we don't give a damn what they say
And this is the, the remix, baby

[Bridge: Usher & Beyonce]
Come a little closer to daddy, put it on you
Need you to know what happens here, stays here
And I'm ready and willing, almost got to go
Got you standing at attention, keep it on the low
Ain't nobody watching, don't worry, they can't see us
I know I got you hot, now let me in
You in the club or the car, wherever you are
Run and tell the DJ, run it back on replay

[Chorus: Usher, Beyonce & Both]
In this club, in this club
Fellas (Ladies), can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watching, I ain't stopping
Baby, I don't give up
Now, run and tell all of your friends
You gotta hear this remix, like...

[Outro: Usher, Beyonce & Lil Wayne]
King and queen, y'all know
Yeah, man
If we make love in this club
What would music be without Soundz?
In this club, in this club
Nobody will know, baby...


Yo, let me tell you how i care, when i was locked up, I couldn't smell the piss only the scent of your hair

So why you acting so scared

Coachella, thank you so much, I love you



[Intro]
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin'
Everything is cool between us Bey
I told you that
Out on the road with my people, just doin' what I gotta do
There's nothing going that shouldn't be goin' on
You gotta trust me, Ma

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 2]
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Verse 3]
So controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 4]
Now that it's over, stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Bridge]
(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again

Hey, I know that I will never disappoint myself

I have cried so many times

I can't regret time spent with you
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Oh! I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah! You hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I

It feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front

That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend




[Intro: Beyonce]
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me
To think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream
Of one day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe
That with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time
But now I moved on
Because I realized I got

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
So controlling, you said
That you love me but you don't
Your family told me
One day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 4: Beyonce]
Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front
Like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Bridge: Beyonce]
(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Hey
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I've cried
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Hey!
Yeah, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again

[Bridge 2: Beyonce]
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Me, myself, and I
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret time spent with you)
I can't regret time spent with you
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Oh!
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah! You hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I




[Intro: Beyonce (Ghostface Killah)]
Ahh, ahh, ahh all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it now
(Uh-huh... Toney Starks..
Yo, baby, what's all this you telling everybody
We broke up and all this, I'm hearin' off the streets and all, that, ma
Talk to me or something, huh, I don't know what's goin' on, baby
You know, I got my clothes in the joint, and you go up here
Just packin' my gear --- what happened boo?)

[Beyonce]
I can't believe I believed, everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think, she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of, one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for four years, and I'm smarter than that
So young and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete, when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on, cuz I realized I got

[Hook 2X: Beyonce]
Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Beyonce]
So controlling, you said that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day, I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing, with your three kids and my home
I've been so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes
No need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend, tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got..

[Hook 2X]

[Hook 2X: Beyonce]
I got me, myself and I (I know that I would never dissapoint myself)
Must have cried a thousand times (all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you (yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot the long way)
But I lucked out to make it through (after all the rain you see the sun come out again)

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah *during hook*]
See that's why you in my life right now, smile right now..
I'm sorry, boo... I'm sorry..
Just you know, that you got mature... shoot..
Ya'll ladies keep your mouth shut right now
Cuz ya'll don't know what y'all talking about
This between me and her, that's my word, she just upset

[Ghostface Killah]
Changes... we all go through changes
Arguments, disagreements, and to some it's dangerous
But your mind and your heart's clogged with all your pain and
But a bond that we was holding, what made us famous
Hey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone
Stop cryin', come talk to Tone
Tell me everything that's goin' wrong like your needs and doubts
My reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts
So I could continue to hold down the foundation
It's pitiful how you could charge me with violations
Patience is the key, fuck the frustrations
We act off our emotions and we start hatin'
And that leads to stress, problems and weight loss
Total baldness, broke homes come from negative forces
Baby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out
When it come, babe, I'm goin' all out
It's T-O-N-E-Y, to Beyonce, my, sweetie pie
Please try, be mine til we die

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Beyonce.. beautiful girl

It's just a midnight summer's jam
The air's so thin, but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the land
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance

[Post-Chorus]
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight

[Verse]
It's in the air, hospitality
Anything you want, what's mine is yours
But don't you worry about the way I talk, woo
It's where I'm from, come and get you some, uh
Hey, all of the locals are happy to get out and meet a new face
We dance in circles, on and on, do-si-do and then we sway
Even the old folks'll come out and rock
And we just hopin' the music don't stop 'til the next day

[Chorus]
It's just a midnight summer's jam
The air's so thin, but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the land
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance

It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight

Act like the south ain't the shit
Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the, south ain't the shit

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus 2: Drake & Beyonce]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

[Verse 3: Drake]
From eight until late, I think 'bout you
You own my nights, I don't know what to do, do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don't go ghost on me, I'ma go Thriller on you, I'ma just (Pull up on you)
I'ma let my hands do the talking when I see you baby girl

We ain't finished talking (Pull up on you)

All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking (Pull up on you)
'Cause they don't wanna see you happier than them
And girl you swear they all ya friends and that's been a problem (Pull up on you)
You the one they hate, just come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back

And I believe it's true
As long as you know who you belong to

[Verse 1: Tierra Whack]
I was always in the lead
Who you wanna be? I'm who they wanna be
B-E-A-U-T-Y-E, never seen so much rage from a queen
Rage from a queen, queen so strong, thought she was a machine
Girl of your dreams, Synclaire, Regine
Turned to the max, can't forget Maxine
Refer to me as a goddess, I'm tired of being modest
A hundred degrees, the hottest, if we being honest
Ebony and ebonics, black people win
They say we bein' demonic, angel in disguise
I hate I have to disguise it, why you gotta despise it?
Rich in the mind, that's why I'm making deposits
Carry all the power, it's time to realize it
(They'll never, ever take my power)

[Chorus: Nija & Beyonce]
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power

They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way (Hold up), oh wow (Boma, boma ye, wow, wow, wow)
They feel a way (Woo), oh wow (Boma, boma ye, wow, wow, wow)

This that rhythm, this that lightning
This that burn, this ain't no perm
This that nappy, this that herb
This that kinfolk, this that skinfolk
This that war, this that bloodline
On the frontline, ready for war
Where you gon' run?
I'ma get loose, get loose, get low, get low
Oh yeah, get loose, get loose, get low, get low
Oh-oh-oh, gotta protect my grace
Keep it locked in the safe
Don't make me get back to my ways
My power, they'll never take

[Chorus: Nija, Nija & Beyonce]
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power

Move along

But I've come much too far
And I know what's in my heart
And I know what I feel
I can tell when it is real
My time has come

It's okay
Be afraid
It's alright (It's alright)
You just take that fear
Turn it in
To your strength
It's called life (It's called life)
And that's why we're here


[Chorus: Beyonce]
Now I've come much too far
And I know what's in my heart
And I know what I feel
And this time I know it's real
My time has come

[Chorus 2: Beyonce & Destiny's Child]
And like the road below me
I know I'll touch the sky above
A million footprints around me
Tell me it can be done
My time has come
Now I've come much too far
And I know what's in my heart
(I know what's in my heart, baby)
'Cause I know what I feel
And this time I know it's real
My time has come

[Bridge: Beyonce]
It's so close
It's been a long time comin'
It's here and now
And I know it'll last
It's so right
That it can't be wrong
Now's the time (Now's the time)
For me to be strong


[Chorus: Beyonce]
Now I've come much too far
And I know what's in my heart
And I know what I feel
And this time I know it's real
My time has come
Now I've come much too far
And I know what's in my heart
(I know what's in my heart, baby)
And I know what I feel
And this time I know it's real
My time has come

[Outro: Destiny's Child & (Beyonce)]
I know that I just gotta keep movin' on ('Cause I know)
I know what's in my heart (Know)
My time has come
I know that I just gotta keep movin' on ('Cause I know)
I know what's in my heart
(I can feel it I can feel it) My time has come
I know that I just gotta keep movin' on (Oh-oh, 'cause I know)
I know what's in my heart

[Chorus]
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me

'Cause I think I'm in love

[Verse 1: Solange (Beyonce)]
Don't try to tell me this ain't real
(I know I'm young)
It's in the way he makes me feel
(I know I'm young)
I think my baby is the one
(I know I'm young)
It's in the way he holds it down
(I know I'm young)
I know you think that this is real
(And you're too young)
I know exactly how you feel
(And you're too young)
Too young to know if he's the one
(And you're too young)
Girl you got time so slow it down


[Chorus]
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible

To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

[Bridge:  Solange Beyonce]
It's too complicated
To explain my relationship
My friends are hating
Cause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'
Leave me alone and just let me be
Find your own thing and get off of me
It's not complicated girl
I've been where you are before
I'm not underratin'
I'm just tryin' to protect your feelings
Solange, listen to me
Understand what I'm sayin'
You'll realize one day how much I care

[Chorus]
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love
I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love


[Verse 2 Rap: Da Brat]
Solange, you might love the boy
Even sneak around the corner, kiss and hug the boy
But Beyonce been there before
And she wouldn't want anybody to hurt you
Cause Matthew would drill the boy
And I can't ignore that you young
We just don't want you to get sprung
On some young dumb-dumb with no crumbs
Get all up in your heart and then run
Gettin' your heart broke is no fun
Neither is somebody tellin' you he not the one
You gotta learn for yourself though
And if you don't experience things
Then you'll never know
I don't want you wishin'
You coulda, shoulda, woulda did it, but you didn't
Listenin to other people's advice
It's your life
Make your own decisions really

[Simba]
Who are you?

[Pumbaa]
I'm Pumbaa, this is Timon

[Timon]
Look, kid
Bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?

[Simba]
Right

[Timon]
Wrong!
When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world

[Pumbaa]
Only embrace what's next

[Timon]
And turn the "what" into "so what?"

[Simba]
Well, that's not what I was taught


[Timon]
Well then maybe you need a new lesson
Repeat after me, kid
Hakuna Matata

Hey honey
Cat got your tongue
Don't look so funny
Mr. comedian jokes on you and
Your good at bet so where's my money
I know you bet that I'd never make that move
So whys the house empty
Lights off by the end of this week
I leave with what I came with baby
I take the dogs you keep the Mercedes

Cause I'm gone but I'm fazed
I walk these roads with grace
And I'll wave with you behind me
With a new smile on my face

Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song  to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
To bad your not here to see it
And by time you get this
I'll be so long gone and far
Aaha I'll send you a postcard

Hey baby
You seen a ghost?
This ain't yo lady
This is the chick that you held back
Now all of the things you've said were crazy
I checked out my list and I feel good about it
I got the new haircut
The one that you said wouldn't look no good
Took that job you said I could not get
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit


Cause you're gone and I'm great
I got rid of your dead weight
And I'll wave at you behind me
With a new smile on my face

Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song  to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
To bad your not here to see it
And by time you get this
I'll be so long gone and far
Aaha I'll send you a postcard

[Intro:]
Woah-ho ooh

[Chorus:]
I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

[Verse 1:]
Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same as last night
And it just don't feel right anymore
I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight
I'm just tired and I need a change

[First Channel:]
Sorry, boy
But you got me bored
And something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied
For a little while
I gotta
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out (woah oh ho-ooh ooh)


[Chorus:]
I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

[Verse 2:]
You call me too frequently
I thought it was so sweet in the beginning
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how I like it (trifling)
That's risen enough
You're time's expired

[Second Channel:]
Sorry, boy
But you got me bored
I gotta move around
If I ain't got a ring by now
That means I'm not tied down
I gotta
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out


[Chorus:]
I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else that I like
I really think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

[Break:]
Woah oh
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Woah oh oh oh oh
Woah-ho oh
Woah oh

Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Switch 'em out, switch 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out
Kick 'em out, kick 'em out


[Chorus:]
I know that you treat me right
But still I think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next
And I think you're nice
But then I seen something else that I like
I really think I gotta make you my next ex
Come on to the next (oh oh)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Beyonce, Kendrick Lamar]
One time, I took a swim in the Nile
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear
It made me relax when I came down
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now
Plunging away 'less my body's on top
All of these currents might cost me my life right now
When danger finds me, it follows with tides
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
She said

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Hey little buddy, where you goin'?
I'm not sure, but I know I'm still in motion
This ain't regular, I seen regular
These streams may take me out to the ocean

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket
Then I'll dive in it 'til I am exhausted and I'm type lacking
Waistline on four deep, senses on four deep
Feel like there's four me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Beyonce, Kendrick Lamar & Beyonce]
One time, I took a swim in the Nile (One time, I took in a swim in the Nile; one time)
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear (I swear, I swear)
It made me relax when I came down (When I came down)
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now (Stimulated)
Plunging away 'less my body's on top (Stimulated, stimulated now; On top)
All of these currents might cost me my life right now (Right now, right now)
Where danger finds me, it follows with tides (Follows with tides; stimulated right now)
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
That's some good

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Got the Nile runnin' through my body
Look at my natural, I'm so exotic
Darker the berry, sweeter the fruit
Deeper the wounded, deeper the roots
Nubian doused in brown, I'm lounging in it
Fountain of Youth, I said I'm drowning in it

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Beyonce, Kendrick Lamar]
I'm in the Nile, deep in denial
I'm in the Nile, deep in denial
That's some good


[Verse 1]
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

[Chorus]
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

[Verse 2]
No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

[Chorus]
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby


[Bridge]
Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
Will you ride around with that H-town?
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want
Yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

[Verse 1]
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

[Chorus]
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

But you keep on frontin'
Won't you say what's on your mind
Cause each and every time you need me
You give me signs
But when I ask you what's the deal
You hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me
You gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel
Cause boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come and get my love

If you keep actin' this way
You're gonna lose my love
I ain't got no time to play
You better hurry up
Cause every time I come around
Crews run around your way
I see you on the corner
But you don't know what to say
When I walk up to you baby
You seem so shy
What's the problem baby
Never had a girl like I (this is the remix)
I can see right through you
And you know you wanna be mine
So get your act together
Cause you're running out of time

You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Everytime I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

[Wyclef:]
Yo, close your eyes, shorty
You're guaranteed to be hypnotized
By the remix that Wyclef provides
I don't care 'bout your size
Girl shake your thighs
All I'm tryin' to do
In the hood is stay alive
Make a little money with Destiny's Child
Thugs hear this song, they dance, they go wild
Like Texas, they movin' like
No-limit soldiers
They went from a dream to the
Young supremes, sing it

[Bridge]
You won't regret, I must confess
I'm really feelin' you
Anything you've ever wanted before is right here for you, for you
Don't worry what they say
Just bring your love my way
'Cause your friends can't do what I can for you
I don't wanna hear you say

(You make me say "No, baby, no, baby, no, baby")
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" ("Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby")
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" ("No, baby, no, baby, no, baby!")
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" ("Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby")

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin', won't you say what's on your mind?
'Cause each and every time you need me, you give me signs
But when I ask you, "What's the deal?", you hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real
Tell me what's going on, tell me how you feel
Boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you
So come and get my love, it's all here for you

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
If you keep acting this way, you're gonna lose my love
I ain't got no time to play, you better hurry up
'Cause every time I come around and crews around your way
I see ya on the corner, but you don't know what to say
When I walk up to you, babe, you seem so shy
What's the problem, baby? Never had a girl like I?
I can see right through you and you know you wanna be mine
So get your act together 'cause you're running out of time

(Don't front, you know you really want it)
(Is it alright if I play my guitar right here)


[Bridge: Beyonce]
Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home, you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
Yo, close your eyes, shorty
You're guaranteed to be hypnotized
By the remix that Wyclef provide
I don't care about your size
Girl, shake your thighs
All I'm tryin' to do in the 'hood is stay alive
Make a little money with Destiny's Child
Thugs hear this song, they dance, they go wild
Like Texas, they movin' like
No Limit soldiers
They went from a dream to the young Supremes
Sing it girls

[Chorus Until Fade: Destiny's Child & (Wyclef Jean)]
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Missy & Beyonce]
Ain't nothin' out there for me, this is where I wanna be

And ain't came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love, and I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hangin' out
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about


[Verse 2: Beyonce (Missy)]
I know he's insecure, everytime I leave out the door
(You lettin' him spoil yo' night? Live ya life, you ain't even his wife)
He ain't gotta worry bout' me cuz' I got somethin' more sweet
(Oh, you must got a diamond ring)
And I know I'm so lucky ain't nothin'

[Chorus: Missy & Beyonce]
Ain't nothin' out there for me, this is where I wanna be

And ain't came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love, and I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hangin' out
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about

[Bridge: Beyonce]
I really love him, he's my baby fo sho (my baby)
I can show him, I love him more then ever before (And I love him)
And he don't know I'm in love
Like the time that we met (I adore him)
I adore him and no man has come closer then that (I love him)

I really love him, he's my baby fo sho (my baby)

[Chorus: Missy & Beyonce]
Ain't nothin' out there for me, this is where I wanna be

[Outro: Beyonce, Missy (Beyonce)]
Look, you goin' or what?
Go ahead I'mma stay here wit' my man
Ain't nothin' out there for me
There's a lotta guys wit' cash and they like to spend money fast
Now is you sure about dat?
I'm chillin' wit' my man wha part don't you understand?
Yeah I'm sure about dat
I think you should really go, I heard the party is outta control
Make sure you sure about that
I don't care about no club
Cuz my man is all I love, yeah I'm sure about that
Don't let em' blow ya high, go out and have a nice time
Is you sure about that?
Girl I do not get high and wit' him I'm spendin' all my time
Yeah, I'm sure about that
Ok stay wit cha man, I'll be at the club doin' my dance, woo! (You're the only one that I'm thinkin' about)

[Verse 1:]
You're all alone
I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you but all I made you was lonely

[Chorus:]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

[Post Chorus:]
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there


[Verse 2:]
All of the times
You used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time
I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain: another you I'll never find

[Chorus:]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

[Post Chorus:]
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there


[Verse 3:]
I'm filled with regret
I'm gonna tip and sew myself in misery
Now in your life
I'll take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me

[Chorus:]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

[Post Chorus:]
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there


[Outro]
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) [x3]
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) [x3]
I'm gonna be there



[Chorus]
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
You've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
Think you've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone

[Verse 1: Kelly]
Take her to the movies
Dinner all the time
Shopping sprees for her
On me, you never spent a dime
But I was there for you
When you had nothing at all
Then, you got a little job and
She's the one you call
And now

[Chorus]
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
You've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
Think you've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Oh, now you're taking me for granted
But you only get one chance
Then, you left me hurting
And it won't happen again, no, no
So she finally left you
It ain't no surprise
That you missed your water
Cause your well went dry, oh
Now that's she's gone, babe

[Chorus]
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
You've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
Think you've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone

[Bridge]
Understand, I understand
Why you think I want you back
After what you did to me
Did you think you blinded me?
Boy, you know whatever you do
It will all come back to you
Cause you tried to play me like a fool
Understand, I understand
Why you think I want you back
After what you did to me
Did you think you blinded me?
Boy, you know whatever you do
It will all come back to you
Cause you tried to play me like a fool

[Breakdown: Beyonce]
Now that she's gone
You, crawlin' back
Got it like that
You made me wait too long
Oh, I'm gone
Now that she's gone
She's gone
Come back, oh
You made me wait too long
Too long, too long, too long, too long
I'm gone

[Chorus]
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
You've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
Think you've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
Think you've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone

[Commandment 7: LaTavia]
Thou shall not leave me wonderin'




[Verse 1: Beyonce]
You had your dreams (dreams)
And I had mine (mine)
Eyes wide open when we dream together
They wanna know how we keep our shit together

[Pre-Chours: Beyonce]
Yeah, now wondering
It's just evolution
We're just getting better
When the two become one
On a quantum level

[Chours: Beyonce]
It's nuclear
With you here
There's nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would you run?
It's nuclear
With you here
We both heat up (ah)

[Post-Chorus: Beyonce]
Blow it all away (eh eh)
Blow it all away (eh eh)
Blow it all away (eh eh)
Blow it all away (eh eh)

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
You had your half
And I had mine (mine)
But now there's no such thing as you and me
I was so used to feeling incomplete

[Pre-Chours: Kelly Rowland & Beyonce]
Eh, now wondering
It's just evolution
We're just getting better
When the two become one
On a quantum level

[Chorus: Beyonce]
(Ahh)
It's nuclear (nuclear)
With you here (you here)
There's nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would you run?
(It's nuclear)
It's nuclear (It's nuclear)
With you here
We both heat up (ah)

[Post-Chorus: Beyonce]
Blow it all away

[Bridge: Michelle Williams & (Kelly Rowland)]
(Oooohhh)
Anytime the climates change between us (Oooh)
We share a bond and chemistry that can't be touched (Eh, eh)
So amazing, superpower take over (Eh, eh)
We never lose the energy

[Chorus: Beyonce]
(Ahh)
It's nuclear (nuclear)
With you here (you here)
There's nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would you run?
(It's nuclear)
It's nuclear (It's nuclear)
With you here

Blow it all away (eh eh)




[Chorus: All]
I was once a fool, too
I know what he's putting you through
So don't tell me what I should do
I ain't gonna end up like you
His love has gotten you blind
Wake up and use your mind
I let you do your thing
Stop, playa hatin' on me

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Kelly, ain't it a shame?
That boy you call your man, he's runnin' game
Don't mean to cop you out, but you gettin' played
I'm just looking out, don't let him do you that way

[Chorus: All]
I was once a fool, too
I know what he's putting you through
So don't tell me what I should do
I ain't gonna end up like you
His love has gotten you blind
Wake up and use your mind
I let you do your thing
Stop, playa hatin' on me

[Verse 2: Kelly and Beyonce]
Beyonce, oh, Beyonce
Don't talk about my man cuz yours was fade
You woke up, he was sprung, you oh so in love
But I let you be, so let me be alone
Let me be alone, oh
No way will I stay and watch him play you for a fool
Don't let a player play on you

[Chorus: All]
I was once a fool, too
I know what he's putting you through
So don't tell me what I should do
I ain't gonna end up like you
His love has gotten you blind
Wake up and use your mind
I let you do your thing
Stop, playa hatin' on me

[Post-Chorus: Beyonce and Kelly]
I'm just looking out
You're my girl, no doubt
I know how men can be
I just think he loves me
Don't be a fool no more
I can't let him go
I'm trying to make you see
I still think he loves me

[Verse 3: William Floyd]
Yeah, yeah, now, check it
You don't know how I feel, you need to stop trippin'
You don't even know the deal, for real
Nothing but love and respect for this girl
That's why she's laced with these diamonds and pearls
Now I know she's been hurt in the past
Gon' find a way to make this love affair last
You got too much time on your hands
You need to stop hatin' and find your own man
He can't tend first child, love the sand
Baby girl, for you I tip all this land
'Gainst the forces of Satan, we gotta make a stand
We could be lovers and the best of friends
A legion of swords couldn't make me retreat
That just shows how much your love inspires me
When I look in your eyes and I know there's a smile
Put it all together, you're my Destiny's Child

[Chorus: All]
I was once a fool, too
I know what he's putting you through
So don't tell me what I should do
I ain't gonna end up like you
His love has gotten you blind
Wake up and use your mind
I let you do your thing
Stop, playa hatin' on me
I was once a fool, too
I know what he's putting you through
So don't tell me what I should do
I ain't gonna end up like you
His love has gotten you blind
Wake up and use your mind


[Verse 1]
This is just another day that I would spend waitin' for the right one
Staring at the night, and wishin' I could be the one to feel the warm sun...

[Pre Chorus]
You're a dream, but I'm wide awake;
I'm in Heaven, for Heaven's sake...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...

[Chorus]
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

[Verse 2]
Tell me that you're living in a place where no one else can find you;
Tell me that you're singing out my name, hoping that I'll hear you...

[Pre Chorus]
Tell me "no", and I'll fade away
But this is lovin' that I won't waste...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...


[Chorus]
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

[Bridge]
"What are the words I'm needin' to hear?"
"How do I know if I'll ever love again?"
Seeing your face makes everything clear... (clear...) clear
And I'll never be the same...

[Chorus]
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

Haaaa
(Come on baby)
Haaaa
(One night)
Haaaa
(One night only)
You want all my love and my devotion
You want my loving soul right on the line
I had no doubt that I could love you forever
The only trouble is I really don't have the time
I've got one night only
One night only
That's all I have to spare
One night only
Let's not pretend you care
I've got one night only
One night only
Come on, we better come on
One night only
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn)
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn!)
One night only
One night only
One night only (Oh)
One night only (Yeah-yeah)
One night only (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
You and I will be running out of time!
Whoo yeah (Come on, come on)
Whoo, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, yeah (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on!

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
If the storm comes
If we burn up
If the wells run dry
You're my reason
To believe in
Another life

[Chorus: Beyonce]
If it all ends
And it's over
If the sky falls fire
Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
If we wake up
Lose our patience
Or even lose our lives, oh
I'll feel lucky
To say that you've been
A friend of mine

[Hook 1: Destiny's Child]
You are my best friend
You been right here through thick and thin
You are my best friend
Gotten me through places I've been
You are my best friend
Through our situations
You have been my inspiration
My best friend
You're still here and I love you

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I think you got angel wings
Hiding up under there somewhere
Michelle, my belle
Dunno where we would be if we never met you girl
I love you, I thank you
You such a blessing
I am so grateful
I truly believe the Lord sent you to me and Kelly
The smile the laughter always makes me happy
When I'm too serious or too intense
With a voice that beautiful you was heaven sent

My sister my life couldn't be better
Doing what I love with my best friend
And making cheddar, Kelly
The most beautifulest girl in the world
You are my survivor and I admire you
You have no idea how special you are
Humble, talented and blessed you are
Sometimes I wish I could be more like you
Sometimes they don't wanna give your credit to you
Wouldn't be a Destiny's Child if it wasn't for you
DC-3 forever I'm thanking you


[Hook 2: Destiny's Child]
Lord thank you for your vision that we see down here on earth
Thank you for your precious gifts
Your sweet precious gift of love
Through everything can no one come between
Us three

[Verse 2: Kelly]
Michelle, ah
Ain't it funny?
God always knows what he is doing
And he showed me some of that when you came
Into me and Bey's life
And just let us know that we can count on you
And actually say with a relaxed heart
Together we are sisters
Your smile has so much meaning, so much life
You are the perfect fit
What more could we ask for?
We got Michelle
Your voice is like water
Your voice is like rain
And the world ain't ready for you
I love you and I will always be here for you

Beyonce, we've come so far together
And it feels so good to have travelled
Half the road of life with an angel
Walking and learning and teaching you the whole time
God is so awesome
And I thank him for answering my prayers as a child
I never told you this, but I prayed for
A lifelong friend as a child
And God just has his way of sending precious treasures
And I found mine
Everyday our relationship gets stronger
And I love you for the
Loyal, unselfish, generous, gifted, wise and beautiful
Person you are
No one, absolutely no one can take that away from us
You are the definition of a true friend


[Verse 3: Michelle]
B and Kelly you two mean so much to me
Only God knew that this union was meant to be
Only God knew all the things we couldn't see
But if we pray together
We'll stay together

Beyonce and Kelly
You both exemplify coming from my eyes
What love is
"Love is patient" Beyonce that's what you've been
"Love is kind" Miss Kelly, that's what you have shown
"It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude
It is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered
It keeps no record of wrong
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres"
1 Corinthians 13:4-7

[Hook 3: Destiny's Child Beyonce]

Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

[Bridge]
Boy, this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe

And tell me how it's looking babe

Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe


[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "Speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yonce all on his mouth like liquor

[Hook]
Yonce all on his mouth like liquor
Yonce all on his mouth like liquor

This what me and her be doing in the back of the Maybach when we're listening to Beyonce
Listen

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Driver, roll up the partition, please
Blind your rearview mirrors with the end of my sleeves
The shit that's on my wrist, you probably wouldn't believe
Every symbol of success levels you couldn't achieve
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I'm alarmed at how she's looking, and she's starting to breathe
Move my arm and grab my john and now she's starting to squeeze
She dropped it with me, fulfilling my need
She swallowed my seeds, she's ready to go
Partition is up, the curtains is closed
Mommy nice with it like she play for the pros
She gag from her throat, while she breathe through her nose
She starting to choke, she curling her toes
Look how she trying to take it all down, come out your clothes
I waited for a second and I thought for a minute
Ain't no loving good enough to give her while I'm up in it

[Hook: Beyonce]
Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Stress never, the sex better, the sex wetter
Check cheddarer, etcetera etceta
Bet bet you could get severed and left deaded
Slept slept and I crypt crept in the s-seven
These niggas be puffing, they piff in the public
They digging, they lusting, the feminine strutting she hitting that button
I dip in the function
I'm prissy, I'm pumping
The tit & the rump
And I'm flipping 'em, dumping 'em
Tricking em trumping em
But if these niggas wanna spend they cheese
Tell em hit up little miss AZ
Very heavy-headed, dick take heed
I'm-a flip out if a bitch play me!

'Cause we like to party!

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Set the scene, 3000 degrees
I ain't worried about them, fuck niggas over there
But they worry about me
I got a homeboy named Butter
And another homeboy there, nigga named Cheese
Fuck with me, baby, I'll make it milk till it drip down your knees
Spit this shit for real-o, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them they never forgot
And nothing else really mean nothing to me
I ain't studying the beat
Talking to me? Girl, why you fucking with me?
Move on there ain't nothing to see
Pshh, always something to saw
I'm the raw, off the rip, cause of him
All of them, will remem-ber the min-
Nute they fell in love with rap, black like having your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due
Cream like when I'm loving you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyonce]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knocking 'til the morning light

[Chorus: Beyonce, Andre 3000 & Consequence]
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!

Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!

We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu (Ooh)

[Interlude: Beyonce]
As a Black woman, I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box. And Black women often feel underestimated. And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process. Be proud of the struggle. Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain. Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right. And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty. Thankful for their freedom

[Intro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
We got the swag sauce she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
You got the swag sauce she dripping swagu, ooh

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I may be young, but I'm ready

Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight
I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking till the morning light

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us
Just hold me close don't let me go
So in love
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow
Cause tonight's the night uh uh oh aye
That I give you everything
Music knocking till the morning light
Cause we like to party

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We out in Abu Dhabi, we like to party
We don't cause trouble, we just ride Bugatti
Bad chick shawty, sorta resemble Sade
Imported her in from Raleigh
And pulled up into the valet
The boy dropped the keys tryna sneak-a-peek at that body
See this that time of the week, she like to freek-a-leak and get naughty
Therefore I like to thank God and Ice Cube for Friday
Cause La-Di-Da-Di... (Cause we like to party)

[Bridge: Beyonce]
So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
Cause toni-ni-ni-ght

Music knocking till the morning light

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2: Beyonce, Ed Sheeran & Both]
Well, baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3: Beyonce, Ed Sheeran & Both]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect, and he looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight


[Intro]
Oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Caramel complexion
With the sexiest expression
Curly hair and corn rows
Very nice physique in his lovely clothes
He looked at me
I looked at him
He asked me what I was thinking
Because he was so beautiful
I didn't know what to say to him

[Pre-Chorus]
He was what I wanted
Exactly what I needed
He was what I fantasized
He was what I dreamed
And it would be so perfect
If him and me was we
Why couldn't I just tell him my feelings?
We were meant to be


[Chorus]
I spotted him walking in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance

[Verse 2]
Sexy lips, platinum wrists
Ten tips like he gets manicured
I can't resist those eyes of his
Staring at his lips and then his ears
And his voice is hypnotizing
And his hands were tantalizing
I dismissed what I wished
Without me realizing

[Pre-Chorus]
He was what I wanted
Exactly what I needed
He was what I fantasized
He was what I dreamed
And it would be so perfect
If him and me was we
Why didn't I just tell him my feelings?
We were meant to be


[Chorus]
I spotted him walking in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I spotted him walking in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance

[Bridge]
All you ladies listening if you ever have the chance
To run into your definition of that perfect man
Don't be blinded by how fine the man is
And miss the chance that might be your last
Make him understand that he's your perfect man
Oh oh oh oh


[Break]
Nana nanana na
Nana nanana na na

Nana na nana na

I spotted him walking in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I spotted him walking in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, uh (woo!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Verse 2]
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

[Chorus]
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Outro: Frank Ocean & Beyonce]
Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality




[Intro]
Ladies, remember long ago, long ago
We asked Santa to get us Christmas dolls, get us Christmas dolls
But now this year, the dolls are you and me, the dolls are you and me
Got the chi'ren under the Christmas tree, the Christmas tree
We've come so far, and it feels so, yes it feels so good
And we're sharin' all our Christmas love, all our Christmas love
We invite you, you to celebrate, to celebrate
On this very, very, very, very special Christmas day

[Verse]
Platinum bells (platinum bells)
Platinum bells (platinum bells)
It's Christmas time with the chi'ren
Ring-a-ling-a-ling (ring-a-ling-a-ling)
Hear DC sing (hear DC sing)
Soon it will be Christmas day

[Chorus]
Ring-a-ling-a-ling (Ring-a-ling-a-ling)

[Verse 1]
Whip, bought it
Crib, got it
Job, on it
Did I ever
Ask you to take me to go
Shopping in Paris or go
Sailing overseas and just
Drape me in Gucci? No
All I ever asked was you to
Pick up the phone when you alone
All I ever asked was you to
Show me some love, kisses and hugs
No, I never had an issue
Go to the club with your boys, baby, I
Never wanted you to stay too long
Just wanted you to show me off

[Chorus]
So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go'n stop playing games
Playing games

[Verse 2]
I know you sayin', "Hit my line"
I'm on your mind, and that
You want this bad
So I'm cool with that
I'm just tryna match your words with your actions
I need more than satisfaction
Is you really 'bout that action?
Really want to give your all
But flex in front of your friends
How that work?
Swear that you doing the most
But we take a picture, can't post it
How that work?
Quit your talking, back that shit up
Won't you say my, say my

[Chorus]
So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go'n stop playing games
Playing games

[Outro]
Games, games
Games, oh, games
We got London on the track

You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go'n stop playing games (Yeah)
Playing games (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
I blow your mind, honey (Damn)
Say it one time, honey (Goddamn)
Sick of them lies, tell 'em goodbye
Get in my ride, I wanna come by
I wanna just listen, get in your vibe
Get in your feelings, get in your-
I get in your feelings, none of your business
I wanna get kids and I wanna get-
I wanna get with you, yeah
I wanna get him out of the picture, yeah
I made it my mission, yeah
And despite the difference, yeah
Me, I'm never actin' shady
You will always be my baby
You'll be my baby, yeah, yeah


[Verse 1]
You're bad for me
I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss, you're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart-breakin' situation I'm up in, but I can't control

[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Verse 2]
You ain't right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flat-lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I'm alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?


[Chorus]
Baby, you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Bridge]
It's just not my body (no)
It's my mind
You don't know how many times I told myself this can't do
And that I don't need you (no, I don't need you, no)
It's so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what's good is that when you're not always there
(there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health

You're just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)
You're just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)


[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Baby, kiss me one more time

[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, do
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

Hey Honey

Mr. Comedian Jokes On You And
You Good At Bet So Where's My Money
I Know You Bet That I'd Never Make Move
So Whys The House Empty
Lights Off By The End Of This Week
I Leave Wit Wat I Came Wit Baby
I Take The Dogs You Keep The Mercedes

[Pre Chorus 1]
Cause I'm gone I'm not fazed
I walk these roads with grace
And I'll wave with you behind me
With a new smile on my face

[Chorus 1]
Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
To bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I'll be so long gone and far
I'll send you a postcard
Aaha I'll send you a postcard

[Verse 2]
Hey baby
You seen a ghost?
This ain't yo lady
This is the chick that you held back
Now all of the things you've said were crazy
I checked out my list and I feel good about it
I got the new haircut
The one that you said wouldn't look no good
Took that job you said I could not get
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit

[Pre Chorus 2]
Cause you're gone and I'm great
I got rid of your dead weight
And I'll wave at you behind me
With a new smile on my face

[Chorus 2]
Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
To bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I'll be so long gone and far
I'll send you a postcard

Deliver me from my enemies, oh God
Defend me from all that rise up against me
Deliver me from the work of iniquity
And save me from the Bloody Men

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Look: Mind state of a gangster from the 40s
Meets the business mind of Motown's Berry Gordy
Turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40's
Sorry, my jewelry's so gaudy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauris
America, meet the gangster, Shawn Corey
"Hey, Young World," wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes, and you can pretend you're me
I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennedys
Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America's not witnessed since
The Harlem Renaissance birthed Black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence
As the incense burn
And the turntables turn and that Al Green plays
I see my mother's afro
As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's
And my papa just left the house
In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm her nerves
As I observe, this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store
We can never be sure, so all we can do is pray


[Break: Beyonce]
Because of your strength
While I walked upon thee
For God is my defense
Pray for me!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
As I head to my homeroom
I observe the ruins, dope needles on the ground
I hear a car go, "Vroom"
Drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle
I ask, "Why you laugh?" They say, "You're too little"
"One day, you'll understand when you become a man
About things you have to get you"
Fast-forward, freeze-frame on my pistol
Fistful of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
Around here, it's the shit that you just do
I just left school
The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had their guns drawn, screaming, "Just move!" ("Don't move!")
"Or is there something else you suggest we can do?"
He made his way to the trunk, opened it like, "Huh?"
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we call corrupt, he calls paying dues
Now, when the rules is blurred-
As they is and were-what am I to do?
But pray? Pray the Lord forgive me
Pray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through
Pray

Deliver me in thy righteousness
And cause me to escape
And climb thine air unto me
Save me thine Lord (pray for me!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Geah... Anywhere there's oppression
The drug profession flourishes like beverages, refreshing
Ahh! Sweet taste of sin
Everything I seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or victim, I beg
What came first? Moving chickens or the egg?
This is why I be so fresh
I'm tryna beat life 'cause I can't cheat death
Treat shame with shamelessness
Aim stainlesses at anuses
You know the game this is?
Move coke like Pepsi, don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
I'm not an angel, I'm sure
But every night before I lay, I drop my knees to the floor
And I pray

[Outro: Beyonce]
The name shall endure forever
The name shall be continued as long as the sun
Pray for me!
Men shall be blessed in Him
All nations shall call Him blessed
In Your name, I pray
Pray for me!
Lord bless us



[Verse 1]
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

[Verse 2]
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (Pray you)
I'm praying you catch me

[Outro]
What are you doing, my love?


[Verse 1]
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

[Chorus]
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' you catch me

[Verse 2]
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

[Chorus]
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me


[Outro]
What are you doing my love?



[Verse 1]
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Verse 2]
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Bridge]
Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Outro]
When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?
You stripped away the masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)

[Verse 1]
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

[Verse 2]
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

[Refrain]
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

[Verse 3]
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give


[Refrain]
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river


[Bridge]
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

If tomorrow all the things were gone
Id worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
Id thank my lucky stars, to be livin' here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, to New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time to make a change
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

[Verse 1]
I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted to one time to see you laughing
I only wanted to see you
Laughing in the purple rain

[Chorus]
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain

[Verse 2]
I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby, I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end

[Chorus]
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain


[Verse 3]
Honey, I know, I know
I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out
For something new, that means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain

[Chorus]
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain

Part of my plans and part of my mind
All of the things that you wanna do

If you show me, baby, believe
So many possibilities
We can look to infinity
If you wanna be with me
Oh...

Boy, you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast
You smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush

You're the first one I've ever seen that burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights

'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I'd rather give up everything
Than to live my, live my life without you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

Old pirates, yes, they rob I;
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever have:
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand outside and look
Some say it's just a part of it:
We've got to fulfill the book

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever have:
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;
None but ourselves can free our mind
Wo! Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them-a can-a stop-a-the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it:
We've got to fulfil the book

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom? -
'Cause all I ever had:
Redemption songs -
All I ever had:
Redemption songs:
These songs of freedom

[Mufasa]
As king, I was most proud of one thing
Having you as my son
I never left you
I never will
Remember who you are
Remember


[Verse 1]
I wish I could believe you, then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

[Verse 2]
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing (Mean a thing), no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same (It ain't the same)
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time (Hard time)
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment (I'm much too full of resentment)
I may never understand why
I'm doin' the best that I can, and I
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment


[Bridge]
(You lied) I'll always remember feelin' (You lied)
Like I was no good (You lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you (You lied)
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than another (You lied)
More than my own life (You lied)
But that part of me I gave you (You lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend like)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment

[Outro]
I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinkin', "What's up with B?"
I been cryin' for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes (You lied)
(You lied) And see she's had half of me (You lied)
How could you lie? (You lied)

ORIGINAL LYRICS:
I'll always remember feeling like I was no good / Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could

Been ridin' with you for six years [...] I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she's had half of me

NEW LYRICS:
I'll always remember feeling like I was no good / Like I couldn't do it for you like that wack bitch could

Been ridin' with you for twelve years [...] I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she's had half of me. She ain't even half of me. That bitch will never be

[Verse 1]
Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

[Chorus]
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

[Verse 2]
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

[Chorus]
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

[Bridge]
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins

[Outro]
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top

[Outro Skit: Tina Knowles]
If you're going through it, just know it's called "going THROUGH it"
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive




[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gon' choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go

Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)

If I let you go

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)

And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Bridge]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go


[Verse 1]
I'm the matriarch of your land
When you need to take my hand
Come into my arms, I'll keep you safe from harm
I'll keep your precious heart

[Verse 2]
Some people try to drag you down
Take it from me, stand and be proud
You're a warrior
You're my warrior

[Pre-Hook]
Be who you are
Be who you are
Know that life holds more than what you see
Rise up little man rise up little man

[Hook]
Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight, we will fight
Little woman we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand we will fight, we will fight
We will stand and together we will rise


[Verse 3]
They'll burn you at the stake if you
Don't act like they want you to
But baby be yourself
Do good and help the world

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 4]

[Verse 1]
If I wrote a book about were we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life With Superman." That's how you make me feel
I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same
I see it everyday in all the things you do
In all the things you say

[Chorus]
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you

Oh Oh Oh I


[Verse 2]
If I were to try to count the ways to make me smile
I'd run out of fingers before i run out of timeless
Things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my loving strong
Make me wanna try my best to give you what you want
And what you need
Give you my whole heart
Not just a little piece
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything
More than a single wish  I'm talking every dream

[Chorus]
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you

[Bridge]
If there's options, i don't want them. They're not worth
My time cause if it's not you, oh no thank you. I like us
Just fine. You're a rock in a sand, you're a smile in a
Cry, you're my joy through the pain, you're the truth
Through the lies. No matter what i do, i know that i can
Count on you

First of all, I wanna thank my connect
The most important person, with all due respect
Thanks to the duffle bag, the brown paper bag
The Nike shoe box for holding all this cash (Okay!)
Boys in blue who put greed before the badge (Okay!)
The first pusher who ever made the stash (Okay!)
The Roc Boys in the building tonight (Hey!)
Oh, what a feeling, I'm feeling life (Hey!)
Thanks to the lames, niggas with bad aim
Thanks to a little change, I tore you out the game
Bullet wounds will stop your buffoonery
Thanks to the pastor, rapping at your eulogy
To Lil' Kim and them, you know the women-friend who
Carry the work cross state for a gentlemen
Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers
And most importantly you: the customer

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Let ya hair down baby, I just hit a score
Pick any place on the planet, pick a shore
Take what the Forbes figured, then figure more
'Cause they forgot to account what I did with the raw
Pick a time, let's pick apart some stores
Pick a weekend for freaking for figure fours
I figure frauds never hit a lick before
So they don't know the feeling when them things get across
Put ya hand out the window, feel the force
Feel the Porsche, hit defrost
Ice-cold, jewels got no flaws
Drop got no top, you on the top floor
Pink Rose, think OJ
I get away with murder when I sling yay
Her-on got less steps than Britney
That means it ain't stepped on, dig me?

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Rare Porsches, rare portraits
Rare guns if you dare come near the fortress
This apple sauce is from the apple orchard
This kinda talk is only reserved for the bosses
Which means I get it from the ground
Which means you get it when I'm around
Rich niggas, black Bar Mitzvahs
Mazel tov, it's a celebration bitches!
"L'chaim!"
I wish for you a hundred years of success but it's my time
Cheers, toast to crime
Number one D-boy, shame he could rhyme

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Sweet!
Let that ride out!
Bring the horns back in, yeah
This is black superhero music right here, baby
American Gangster
Taking flight, coming to a town near you
Soon as I touch down, I just want y'all to start playing the horns like...
Hovi's home!
Lukey, baby!
Hahahahaha... oww!



[Verse 1]
Let me sit this ass on you, show you how I feel
Let me take this off, will you watch me
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch me, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch me, baby?
Grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know, that you, ready
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady

[Chorus]
And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me

[Bridge]
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

[Verse 2]
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

[Chorus]
So rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me

[Interlude]
Hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Rock, hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady

[Verse 3]
Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it
I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn

[Verse 4]
I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now, yes Lord, damn baby
Driving me cray, cray
You ain't right for doing it to me like that daddy
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me, please
Punish me please
Daddy, what you gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face?
Yeah, hell yeah, ride me so deep
Ooh, my shit's so good that it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures, consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers, baby, baby, baby, baby
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin
Rockets and waterfalls

[Outro]
Damn


Coming soon...

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall?
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Rudolph we love you boy
Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer
Bringing us Christmas joy


Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Rudolph we love you boy
Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer
Spreading the Christmas joy

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Rudolph we love you boy
Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer
Bringing us Christmas joy

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen
But don't forget Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer

[Scar]
Simba, what have you done?

[Simba]
It was a stampede
He tried to save me, it was an accident
What am I gonna do?

[Scar]
Run away, Simba
And never return

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
These four lonely walls have changed the way I feel
The way I feel, I'm standing still
And nothing else matters now, you're not here
So where are you? I've been callin' you, I'm missin' you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasin' you, chasin' you
Memories turn to dust, please don't bury us
I got you, I got you

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all

[Post-Chorus: Beyonce]
If I lose myself, I lose it all

[Verse 2: Arrow Benjamin]
I've outrun the fears that chased, they're standin' still
I'm runnin' still, I'm runnin' still
And every voice that cried inside my head, forever drives
Forever drives, I've killed the lights, oh


[Pre-Chorus: Arrow Benjamin]
Where else can I go? And where else can I go?
Chasing you, chasing you, oh

[Chorus: Arrow Benjamin + Beyonce]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all

[Post-Chorus: Arrow Benjamin + Beyonce]
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all

You can't hold me (You can't hold me)
I work my nine to give and I cut my check
This goes out to all the women getting it in
Get on your grind
To the other men that respect what I do
Please accept my shine
Boy, I know you love it
How we're smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bear the children (Children)
Then get back to business
See, you better not play me (Me)
Don't come here, baby
Hope you still like me
F-U, pay me

[Pre-Chorus]
My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power, with our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me

[Interlude: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
But for the attention of men
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes

Sail on down the line, 'bout
A half a mile or so, and

Maybe once or twice, you see
Time after time I tried, I tried to
Hold on to what we got, but
Now you're goin'

[Bridge: Destiny's Child]
And I don't mind
'Bout the things you're gonna say Lord
I gave all my money, and my time
I know, I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name

[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyonce]
Guess I'll be on my way
I won't be back to say
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time (Time)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Sail on down the line, ain't it
Funny how the time can go, all my
Friends say they told me so, but
It doesn't matter
It was plain to see that a
Small town girl like me, just
Wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishful thinkin'


[Verse: Beyonce]
I gave you my heart
And I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away? Hey, hey

I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time

Sosa, the Elohim intervene like boy you the truth
Don't die (don't die, don't die)
Angels on both sides, toast with mimosas (both sides, both sides)
Your president tweeting about Hov like he knows us
My road to the top was to take what you owe us
I give a fuck what that man find vulgar
Just look in my eyes when you toast us

Put it on ice (ice, ice, ice), celebrate that we made it

We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away, oh
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

[Verse 2]
Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

[Verse 3]
And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that way



[Verse 1]
Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side

[Chorus]
In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide

[Chorus]
In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe

[Outro: Beyonce]

H-Town, goin' down

[Verse 1]
I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine?

[Chorus]
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world
After she saves the world?

[Verse 2]
I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold


[Chorus]
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

[Verse 3]
I've given too much of myself and now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me
Save me from myself

[Chorus]
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

(After she saves the world)
After she saves the world

Darkchild '99

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say "baby I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say "baby I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Any other day, I would call, you would say (Say)
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh, yeah ok" (Uh huh, ok)
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say (Let me say)
I am not the one to sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me, if I'm the girl that you claim (Claim)
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?


[Pre-Chorus: Destiny's Child, Beyonce]
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Chorus (Beyonce)]
Say my name, say my name (Say my name, is around you)
If no one is around you, say "baby I love you" (love you)
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby (baby, yeah, hey yeah)
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say "baby I love you" (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
If you ain't runnin' game (no no no no, no no)
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
What is up with this?
Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, saying you gotta bounce (Bounce)
When two seconds ago, you said you just got in the house
(The house)
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel you gotta lie? (Feel, lie)
Gettin' caught up in your game, when you cannot say my name


[Pre-Chorus: Destiny's Child, Beyonce]
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange

Don't try to change it now, saying you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago, you said you just got in the house

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you say that I am assuming things

Left you guys behind
Oh, I'm so lonely, so lonely, ooh

[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
In the jungle, ain't no bible
Showtime, showtime, no recital
Show no fear, boy, where's your spinal?
Where's your backbone? Where's your pyro?
I had to be everything you couldn't be for my survival
My own idol, skipped my trial
Took my rightful, rightful title
No remorse, the sin is final
I found all my own disciples
I'm too far gone, down this spiral
No white angels, just albinos
Check my eyes, man, they're all white, man
Rollin' back now, where'd the light go?
Guess it died, so cold like Cairo
Crack my neck back like I'm the chiro

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez & 070 Shake]
I want your world at my feet
I want your world at my feet
I've waited too long for this
I've waited too long for this
I want them to bow down to me
I want your world at my feet
I waited too long for this
I need this like oxygen


[Verse 3: 070 Shake]
Sorry, sorry
My own family, I
Slayed you, betrayed you
Don't you grow to be like me
I'm under, sinking to the darkest sea
Darkest sea, eeh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I'm in this fight and I'm swinging, and my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness, but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand and I can barely stand
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

[Verse 2]
I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you would stretch your hand looking for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me


[Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Bridge]
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely no more
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

[Chorus]
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely


[Verse 1]
This is for them 20-somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30-somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40-somethings
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them 50-somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head

[Refrain]
Mom and Dad tried to hide the world
Said the world's just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and Dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made 'em want me more
At 14, they asked me what I wanna be
I said, "Baby, 21, so I get me a drink"

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy I'm out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin' life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
This is for them pretty somethings
Living in the fast lane, see you when you crash, babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them chipper somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters

Hot, top, flight, boy I'm out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night

[Bridge]
You know it costs to be the boss
One day you'll run the town
For now make your life what you decide
Baby, party 'til the fire marshals shut this sucks down


[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy I'm out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

[Outro]
There's not a real way to live this, for real
Just remember to stay relentless
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Intro: Destiny's Child]
Second nature
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey
Second nature

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Why does love always seem so very hard?
It's such a struggle
To win the reward
Because we're playin' with the wrong cards
But I think I've got the winnin' hand
There's something different about you, babe
That tells me I can
I say it's easy for the things that I do
Never a question
Always a pleasure to
Love you, love you, love you

[Channel: Destiny's Child]
Baby, I won't say no
The love that you give is so
I'm hooked and I can't let go of this love

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & (Beyonce)]
It's so natural
So natural to give my love
It's so easy (Easy like second nature)
Second nature (Second nature)

Second nature (Second nature)

[Break: Destiny's Child & (Beyonce)]
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey, (Ooh... hey, baby, baby)
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Thinkin' of you is the breath that I take
Just for your love, I can't wait
I could never think twice
It wakes me up in the mornin'
And in the middle of the night
And with a smile on my face
I'm ready

[Channel: Destiny's Child & (Beyonce)]
Baby, I won't say no (Won't say no)
The love that you give is so (Give is so)
I'm hooked and I can't let go of this love

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kanye West]
I know you see me now, right now (You see me now, right now)
I know you see me now, right now (You see, you see)
I know you see me now, right now (Haha, yeah)
I know you see me now, right now

[Bridge 1: Beyonce & Kanye West]
I got my suit and tie, and I don't know if y'all know
Well maybe y'all do, or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care, it's how we on it all the time
So I'ma get my money, let's go

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you"
Immature adult, insecure asshole
If you fall on the concrete, that's your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass slow
She got a big booty but she couldn't drop it as low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin' money they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass, go
Straight to jail yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'em I said "Hello"
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said "Hell no"
Yo what you say when your people get outta jail, huh?


[Bridge 2: Beyonce & (Kanye West)]
My niggas is home
I guess I got everything, everything I want
(Let's go shopping, dog, let's celebrate)
But I don't, no matter how good it gets, it'll never be like before
(Free Weezy though)
No women in the crowd, screamin' and it's loud
Doin' things not allowed and I swear it's going down right now
(You know what it is)
I know one thing, my mama would be proud
And you see me lookin' up
'Cause I know she's lookin' down right now

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I'm in the Louvre, lookin' for fossils
'Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells, it's so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barneys
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic: 32
Lyrically, can't none of y'all murder Ye
'Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here's somethin' that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child's illusions become reality


[Bridge 3: Beyonce & Kanye West]
Now go get my throne, 'cause I don't wanna stop
I just go in my zone, and I'ma make it hot 'til it's time to go
When it's time to go, where you tryna go?
You better act like you can see me now

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Exactly
Rosewood
Aha, aha
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Man, today I am the freshest in the world, but that's the obvious
Damn, I look so sexy, and you look like a pile of shit
When I told my ex I love her, she went and married another
And changed her whole name up, you a Yugoslavi' chick
"Be successful," that's what Dad told me
So everything I D-O, now I OD
They say G.O.O.D. Music like the new Miami Heat, shit
Comparin' them to us, man they gotta add Kobe
Whoadie, holy moley went, from G-Shockin' to Rollie
From the D, coppin' in Beverly Hills, I'm Axel Foley
Nah, nah, baby boy, you Jody, in the party, they all know me
Yeah, I saw your ass in line, boy, you was lookin' like the old me
Presidential suit, my girls Michelle and Chanel
She gave me designer, uh, she keep it au natural
I say it again, I'm chasin' cheese, dodgin' rat traps
Chasin' pussy you might end up with a Kat Stacks
Nasty trick, you's a nasty chick
Ooh, you know I like that nasty shit
Got it made in every way, gettin' paid every day
What Sean sound like, 'Ye protege?
He sound like he a pro to me
"I know Kanye a jerk," how could you say that?
He rode me and my mama 'round in his Maybach
What kind of jerk is that? What kind of jerks is y'all?
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off
Bet you take it off or chase him through the mall
We workin' twice as hard, so everything come in twos
Double drinks, double girls
We be gettin' paid like W-2
Rep Westside, throwin' up Ws
"We love you Sean," I love you too
Ooh-ooh, you know I do


[Outro: Kanye West]
Hey, feel like one of those old R. Kelly joints, right?
I bet they put me back on the cover of Ebony now
I know Jet magazine calling right now
You looking good today too, I like that
You got your new suit on and she got the extra cute on
I know you thinking, "This that Yeezy we all love"
I'm back, baby, we back, baby
Uncle Charlie, by the way
And I'ma let you finish, but I got Beyonce on the track
That's what it is
Black excellence, baby
This is the elite
We the greatest in the world baby, we the greatest in the world!!!
Hahahahaha
Yeah, Lex Luger, No ID, Yeezy
Uh

I see music. It's more than just...what I hear. When I'm connected to something, I immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion. A memory from my childhood, thoughts about life, my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music. And I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do a visual album; I wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head, cause it's what makes it mine. That vision in my brain is what I want people to experience the first time



I feel like, right now, people experience music differently. I remember seeing Thriller on TV with my family. It was an event; we all sat around the TV and now, looking back, I'm so lucky I was born around that time. I miss that...immersive experience. Now, people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their iPods - they don't really invest in a full album. It's all about the single and the hype, there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans. I felt like 'I don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out. I just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans'. I told my team 'I wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time', everyone thought I was crazy but we're actually doing it. It's happening



I wanted to make this body of work and, I feel like it's something that's lost in Pop music. I wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression. Not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album. It was important that we made this a movie, we made this an experience. I wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me. I would make my best art and just put it out and that's-that's why it's out today



There's a moment where things click. When I was in the studio I was threading the songs together and I...thought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child. In my mind we would perform on Star Search, we would win; we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time. There's no way in the world I would ever imagine losing as a possbility. You know, I was only 9 years old so, at that time, you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose! It was the best message for me. When I put Ed MacMahon introducing us as "the Hip-Hop rapping Girls' TYME" it clicked something in my mind. I feel like something about the aggression of Bow Down and the attitude of Flawless - the reality is, sometimes you lose. And you're never too good to lose, you're never too big to lose, you're never too smart to lose; it happens, and it happens when it needs to happen. And you have to embrace those things



I was scrolling through videos about feminism on YouTube and I ran across this video of this incredible Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Everything she said is exactly how I feel

My message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection. I had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion. And at the end of the day when you go through all of these things, is it worth it? I mean, you get this trophy and you're like, 'I basically starved, I have neglected all of the people that I love, I've conformed to what everybody else thinks I should be and I have this trophy. What does that mean?'. The trophy represents all of the sacrafices I made as a kid. All of the time that I lost, being on the road/ in the studios as a child. And, I just wanna throw that shit up
I have a lot of awards and I have a lot of these things that I'm amazing and I'm - I worked my ass of, I worked harder then probably everybody I know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'Mommy'. No, nothing feels like when I look at my husband in the eyes, nothing feels like when I'm respected, when I get on the stage and I see I'm changing people's lives. Those are the things that matter and, at this point in my life, that's what I'm striving for. Growth, love, happiness, fun; enjoying your life, it's short - that's the message




[Verse 1:]
I always loved you
Even though you did me wrong
I always stayed by your side
I guess I was your fool
I always cared
There's no one above you
I swear
Cheated on me now she's there

[Verse 2:]
She won't answer your calls
Don't wanna be bothered at all
I guess I'll be the one standing with open arms
Sucker for love
Kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you

[Chorus:]
I'll settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one you run to
You come running to
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Settle for you

[Verse 3:]
I can never leave you
No matter how hard I try
You'll probably do it again
I'll still be right here waiting
Nothing has changed
It remains
The same
I can't explain

[Verse 4:]
Sucker for love
Your kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you

[Chorus:]
Even
When the chips
Are down
I'll still
Settle for you
You'll probably
Hurt me again
I'll still
Settle for you
I know I must be
The world's
Greatest fool
I'll still
Settle for you

[Chorus:]
I will always
Love you
No matter how
Hard I try
Probably
Do it again
I'll still be
Here waiting
Stuck with you
In love with you
Here for you
Loving you
Settling for you
Baby, yea


Look what you've done to me
I'm losing my mind
You've got the best of me
And it feels so right
You've got a way you work me
It's workin me I
I can't help my emotions when you're dancin close to me

Sexually healin come and rescue me

I can't help my emotions when you're dancin close to me

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I saw your new girlfriend the other day
And I expected for her to be so much more than she was
I checked out her style
The way she smiled
The way she moved
The things she said
The way she looked at me like, "I got yo man"

[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyonce, with Destiny's Child]
She can't love you like I can
All of her love just can't compare to what I have
She can't touch you like I do
'Cause when y'all touching
You pretend it's me and you

[Chorus (Beyonce)]
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine (Oh baby, baby, baby, yeah)
There's no reason for you to waste your time (No, no, no, no, no)

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
When we were together
You told me what you didn't like
And you went out and got exactly that type
Except that your new girl is nothing compared to me
Everything that she did wrong I always do right

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyonce, with Destiny's Child]
She can't hold you like I can
Boy you a fool if you can't realize what you had
She can't feel you like I can
Cause I'm a girl that's always standing by my man

[Chorus]
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time

[Bridge: Kelly]
There's no way, there's no way
That her love could be could be good as mine
There's no reason, no reason
For you to even go and waste your time
Your time

[Chorus]
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time

Tells me you don't really care about me
So you need to show me
Before I have to go
Don't you have me thinkin' you love me
Don't play with my heart

We're talking to each other
Each and every day and all through the night (night babe)
I question time and time again
Are we just a little more than friends
You say yes but love is much less
Your actions (speak) louder than words

Baby you need to show me
If you really do love me
The pressure that you're leavin' on me
Tells me you don't really care about me

We can't communicate (we can't communicate)
Why must you act this way (act this way)
I hope you think that I'm sincere
Cuz I'm wondering (wondering) if you (if you) really care (care)
Whether or not the game has changed, tell me (baby)
Cuz I can't be played

Baby let me know (before I have to go)
Please don't hesitate (let your feelin's show)
Please make up your mind before you outta time
You're gonna look up one day (and I am)
Gonna be gone baby (gone baby)

Baby you need to show me

The pressure that you're leavin' on me
Tells me you don't really care about me
So you need to show me
Before I have to go
Don't you have me thinkin' you love me
Don't play with my heart




[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
I wanna know
If I could get to know you
So many things, baby

I don't know
If you feel the same as I do
Give me a sign, baby
Show me what to do

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland & (Destiny's Child)]
(Can I be all you need?)
Can I be all you need?

(Baby, the time is now)
The time is now
(If you just show me how)
Baby, show me how

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Show me the way to love you
Every night and every day
I'm thinkin' of you
All I need is just a chance to love you
Show me the way, baby
Show me the way, the way

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
What would it take
For us to get together?
I wanna know
Would you stay with me forever?
Give me the chance
I know I can make you love me
Just say the word, baby
Let me make you see

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce & (Destiny's Child)]

[Chorus Until Fade: Destiny's Child with Beyonce Lead]

[Intro: Beyonce]
In December, every sign has its own mode
I was in love with a Sagittarius
See the emotions he put me through
From Capricorns to Aquarius
They all got their different minds
The affection of a Virgo
Which sign matches good with mine?

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I was in love with a Sagittarius, he blew my mind
He also had a flip side too much like a Gemini
He was freaky like a Taurus, the way he handled me, yeah
Flirtatious like an Aries
Which sign is best for me?

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all

[Verse 2: Beyonce & (Missy Elliott)]
Hey, I wish he was a Virgo, the same sign as me
And know how to show me love, 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces
(Rewind)
I wish he was a Virgo, the same sign as me
And know how to show me love, 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces
I want him sexy like a Scorpio
The way he holds me close, yeah
Sensitive as a Cancer
Every sign from coast to coast


[Chorus: Beyonce]
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all

[Bridge: Beyonce]
I can't explain why I love him
Bossy like Leo's do
Got game like an Aquarius
Switch moves after he's been with you
Fun like a Libra
He stays on my mind
He's so unpredictable
He reminds me of every sign

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all


[Bridge: Beyonce]
Every sign from the first to the last (Ohh)
Everyday of the month has its good and its bad
(Everyday of the month)
I love you all, all twelve signs
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh

[Bridge 2: Missy Elliott]
Every one of these signs, you know you blowing me away
No matter when you're born for sure with me you okay
I love every one of y'all no matter what sign you are
January to December, here's my open arms

[Outro Until Fade: Beyonce]
I was in love with a Sagittarius
I was in love with a Sagittarius
I was in love with a Sagittarius
I was in love with a Sagittarius

Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright

Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me, then takes me

Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Don't treat me to the things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Haaa..by popular demand Sasha Feirce, Nicki Minaj, let's go

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo rude boy, why you cross me like a little t?
I'm Minaj, big M, uh'uh not a Mickey D
Now, I'm flyer than a broom (broom), broom, I dissed him
Then I peel up in a room (room), boomin' system
Now listen, now listen, LISTEN
I was there through your bid in prison
Ya know, I coulda been your wife
But sucks for you, boo-hoo
I would never rent a tux for you
Excuse me, I'm buzzing like bumblebees
Football & they all wanna fumble me
I was a thirty-two D in my Dugarees
Can I have a couple more cucumbers, please?
Now I'm that bitch, now I'm the bad witch
I need a lot of cheese up on my sandwich
Just got a new boyfriend, he's Pepe Le Pew
And he just bought me two Giuseppe shoes. (thank you!)
That's one for right, & one for the left
Yes to the left, left, to the left
Now we should all go to Jerry Springer
And you could put the ring up on my middle finger


[Beyonce]
All the single ladies [x7]
Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip but now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)

I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Got me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I could care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
Cause you had your turn
But now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me
Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)

Don't treat me to the things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Is a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny
To infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Hey, hey -
And just like a ghost
You'll be gone, gone
Diddy Bop, like Sean, John, John
Anyway, I like Lauren Lon-don
Get my chopsticks, get me my won-ton
Cus you thought you'd win
But I'd knew you'd lose
Honey, I'm flyer than altitude crews
Yes, I'm cool, you can chuck deuce
Nicki been hot since Duck, Duck Goose


[Beyonce:]
All the single ladies [x7]
Now put your hands up

Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it (x2)

[Verse 1]
Blueberry trench and a S on top
Lemonade like I'm Beyonce
Grape juice? No, no, orange juice
Or green apple juice, shall I say
Strawberries on a summer evening, of course
Skittles overcoming my sad and sourness
The lows and the highs, they're all rainbows
Too blind to see the dark side

[Chorus]
Skittles, the color of the rainbow
To kill my sour mind's thoughts
Sugarcoating on top of a sad, sad day
The Skittles of my heart
My mind's way too overrated and overheated
These negative thoughts gonna drown in a blueberry trench
The Skittles of my heart

[Verse 2]
These thoughts gonna be baked into an apple pie
The photos are overwhelming, but I'll tell them paparazzi to STOP
These mixed berry brains won't go to waste
I'll wash them out like water in a drain
Thoughts of Sweet Heat, and more
Negative Thoughts are like disgusting Zombie Skittles: I'll drop them on the floor

[Chorus]
Skittles, the color of the rainbow
To kill my sour mind's thoughts
Sugarcoating on top of a sad, sad day
The Skittles of my heart
My mind's way too overrated and overheated
These negative thoughts gonna drown in a blueberry trench
The Skittles of my heart

[Chorus]
Skittles, the color of the rainbow
To kill my sour mind's thoughts
Sugarcoating on top of a sad, sad day
The Skittles of my heart
My mind's way too overrated and overheated
These negative thoughts gonna drown in a blueberry trench
The Skittles of my heart
Skittles, the color of the rainbow
To kill my sour mind's thoughts
Sugarcoating on top of a sad, sad day
The Skittles of my heart
My mind's way too overrated and overheated
These negative thoughts gonna drown in a blueberry trench
The Skittles of my heart


[Verse 1]
I read all of the magazines
While waiting around
You said you couldn't wait to see me
But you got stuck in town
So turn off the phone
Now we're finally alone
And some moments at the end of the day
Feel your touch and it's the sweetest
Your kisses are my weakness
I never want them to go away

[Chorus]
I wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
As I look into your eyes (eyes)
No need to get busy so lets take our time
And make slow love slow love
And every minute that we have (have)
It goes too fast
Wanna show you how to rock it
So this feelin last and
Make slow love slow love
Slow love slow love slow love all night

[Verse 2]
It is just a few little things
That you gotta know
A girl will give you all of her heart
When it's happening slow
I need a little laughter
And love will follow after
Lets take this chance to steal away
Your kisses are delicious
And no one is gonna miss us
Tonight I really want you to stay


[Chorus]
I wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
As I look into your eyes (eyes)
No need to get busy so lets take our time
And make slow love slow love
And every minute that we have (have)
It goes too fast
Wanna show you how to rock it
So this feelin last and
Make slow love slow love
Slow love slow love slow love all night

[Bridge]
So I'm callin out do you hear my cries?
Don't have to say goodbye
You're the breath on my skin cherish the taste
It's far too good to go to waste
Feel my desire
Make sweet love all through
All through the night
Make love through the night

[Chorus]
I wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
As I look into your eyes (eyes)
No need to get busy so lets take our time
And make slow love slow love
And every minute that we have (have)

Hey how ya doin', yeah I'm doin' mighty fine
Last time I seen ya, it's been a long time
Stop smilin' at me, get that look off your face
Please don't even front, stop bein' so fake
I know you do not like me and you made it very clear
You're always talkin' about me from what I hear
Always put me down when you thought that you could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly, with Destiny's Child]
Wasn't it you that said

Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't make it through?
And wasn't it you that said
That I didn't look too good, that I wouldn't do too good?

Now we doin' platinum and now you can't take it
For all the people 'round us that have been negative
Look at us now and see how we live
I stayed down wit' my people, all the ones that keep it real
Didn't get caught up, and how that make you feel?
All the things I'm doin' that you thought I never could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

I grew up in Houston, Texas visiting Prairie View. We rehearsed at TSU for many years in Third Ward. And I always dreamed of going to an HBCU. My college was Destiny's Child. My college was traveling around the world and life was my teacher. I wanted a Black orchestra. I wanted the steppers. I needed the vocalists. 'Cause I wanted different characters-I didn't want us all doing the same thing. And the amount of swag is just limitless, like...  the things that these young people can do with their bodies and the music they can play and the drumrolls and the haircuts and the bodies and the... it's just not right. It's just so much damn swag

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry

[Verse 1]
He trying to roll me up (I ain't sorry)
I ain't picking up (I ain't sorry)
Headed to the club (I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you (I ain't sorry)
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSE cups
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout

[Pre-Chorus]
Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
Tell him, boy, bye, boy, bye, middle fingers up
I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry (You)
Sorry, I ain't sorry (You)
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah


[Verse 2]
Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding
(You interrupting my grinding)
I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry

[Bridge]
Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today, I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is

[Outro]
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

Me and my ladies sip my D'USSE cup  (I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry)
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause...

[Interlude]
Bug a boos, I need a good laugh
You, make me laugh

Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding

[Verse 3]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Foolish of me to dream while you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got...

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
(I see you, how did you do that so fast? She has on my outfit, y'all)
Sing it

(That's all I got in the end)
(That's what I found out) Found out
(And it ain't no need to cry) Sing it ladies
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

Right, ladies? Yes

Chillin' with Rosie O'Donnell
Having a good time we clownin'

[Verse 1]
I feel weak, we've been here before
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say "I still love you"

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

[Chorus]
Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life

[Verse 2]
I can see that we're not happy here
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it, well, I don't
Maybe you'll settle, well, I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find


[Chorus]
Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life

[Bridge]
I know that this will hurt you, I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie
I feel I know what's the best for us

[Breakdown]
Let's... start over!
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over, I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we both know that this love won't die
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life

As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family



[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Baby, I want for nothing
Just your tender sweet loving
I know you've got your things to do
But tell me what means more to you
Hanging out with me or with your boys
Sometimes, I do get lonely
But no you and no one to hold me
You want so much to lay me down
Is that what keeps you hanging 'round
Is that the only way to win your heart?

[Chorus]
Well, if I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay
If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I'll be, be yours forever
But can we keep us together?
I know the time is drawing near
I promised you, has it been a year?
Baby, now I'm ready
Will you stay? Stay

[Chorus]
Well, if I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay
If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay (Baby, oh)

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Every night I lay and think about it
If you love me, you could live without it
But I don't wanna do you that way
No, no, no, no, no, no
I don't know exactly what I'm feelin'
I'm kinda scared but then I'm kinda willin'
Will you promise me just one thing? (Thing, no, no)
No matter what you're gonna stay

[Chorus]
Well, if I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay
If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay

Well, if I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay
If I granted all of your wishes (Stay, stay)
Give you more than touches and kisses (Stay, stay)
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay (Stay, stay, stay)

If I loved you a little bit longer (Stay, please stay)
If my love was a little bit stronger (Stay, please stay)
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay (Stay, stay, stay)

[Lloyd Banks:]
G-unit!
Banks

You selling half you soul with the kid and fuck
Walk around with my robe in the crib but
You gotta be able to hold on your lid and tuck
About anything that the both of us did and such, we both grown
When I create enough gossiping on my own time
The OG's thinking they hopping on a gold mine
I need you close to me
Is it a sign of it what this feelings suppose to be
That's constantly approaching me
And honestly we both can see
That ain't all about pussy cause I got bitches that'll fly across the coast for me
Banks is a mack, he's something like a pimp
Got the style, got the smile, got the look, got the limp
Only my wifey getting lobster and shrimp
And I ain't got one so there's another one playing shotgun
I need a chick that I'l take the heat when the cops come
I get ya out later on it won't be long


[Chorus]

Steppin' to the bad side
Gonna take a mean ride
The smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay
Both: Stepping to the bad side today

[Hook]
Steppin' to the bad side, ooh, ooh, ooh
Gonna take a mean ride, ooh, ooh, ooh

The smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay
Steppin' to the bad side today

[Verse 1]
I tell ya now, it's got to end
No more trusting them, my friend
We're gonna change our style, change our tone
Look for songs we sing our own

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got you all the breaks you need
In just two years, we'll be in the lead
Just sit back, it's plain to see
Open your eyes and trust in me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I was a man who tried to be good
I was always misunderstood
Halfway there, they told me
You got to get down and show your dangerous ?

You know the smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay

Steppin to the bad side(Dreamettes: Today)

[James Thunder Early]
Man just stole my woman from me
Took her down to Tennessee
She was the best girl I ever knew
If it wasn't for him, she'd still be true
I've always been a good man, it's been said
Dammit, that man, I wish you were dead
Men like him make good men mad
Starting today I'm gonna be bad

[Hook]


[Verse 1]
I'm so in love
I'm still in love
I never met love quite before
Until I saw your face
And watching stars without you
My soul cries
My heaving heart
Is full of pain
When we're apart
The aching

[Chorus]
I'm kissing you
Oh
I'm kissing you, oh

[Verse 2]
You're my father, you're my soldier
You protect me
Boy you saved me
You're best friend
You're my husband
You are my doctor, counselor, provider, professor, my everything
And I love you, I love you, I love you, yes, I love you


[Verse 3]
I, I need you, I need you, I need you
I can't live without you
I trust you, I trust you with every ounce of me
Just teach me boy teach me just take me
When we make love I can feel all your spirits
Deep inside of me yea
Baby you're so pure, oh

[Chorus 2]
I'm kissing you forever and ever and ever
I love kissing you, kissing you, kissing you
I love everything about you, baby
It's been so many years since we found love
You got something special, baby

[Verse 4]
We can cry together
We can grow together
Be ourselves together
And I love you
More than music
Yes, I love you more than music

I rather be kissing you, oh
I'm kissing you, oh
Kissing you
Kissing you

[Mocha]
Yo, that's what love will do, leave a chick gullible
Everything wonderful
Till he leaves from under you
Yea I seen it before
I dont need it no more
I'm overseas on tour, lettin my feet in the door
And for those niggas that'll try to scam stacks from me
Well that depends on how u handle my cat for me
Get afectionate and erectionate
But the less u trick, thats the less u get
There u go, I got impressions so stress on
U jus second best uhh
Stop second guess-on
U never listen, u can't stop it I'm on fire
Know that u goin leave out here wit your pockets lighter
[LaTavia]
Count a stack about a hundred grand, rubber bands
[Mocha]
I'm like your other hand, ain't no other man
Understand, not til I told u that, hold that
I dont want it if u can't hold back, know that

Verse 1:
[Beyonce]
Baby boy, I can see that you want me
But baby it ain't that easy
Take your time, do me right
You gotta work at me, cause I'm not that type (Baby)

Hook:
I need you to, stimulate me
You can have me
If you want me

You can have me
If you want me

Verse 2:
[Kelly/LaTavia]
Take me out in the six
Lemme know that you wanna be up in my mix
You say you want my sweet body
But first you gotta pamper me
Say you gotta phat crib in the hills
Dont mean a thing to me
Unless I got the keys
If you said half goes to me (Tell me)

Hook

Rap:

[Verse 1:]
I like to feel so high and you feel good feeling low
I like my colors vivid and you paint your colors gold
I like to see the world and you like your weekends home
But I've been staying behind
While you refused to go

[Chorus:]
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

[Verse 2:]
You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me and doing the same

[Chorus:]
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign


[Verse 3:]
I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lose you honey
I even slowed down thought you'd follow
But you took your own roads honey
Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling
Only to find that
I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind
While you refused to go

[Chorus:]
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign



Chorus
[B] Yo where the brother by my side at?

It's funny how things turn around
Last night you tryna get down you act like you down
Any other time it's like you steady hatin on Brown
I'm tryna see my name in lights you tryna short  out the ground

[Mekhi]
You're the one that's got it twisted cause I'm right by your side
I had a bad day you jumpin' on my back for a ride
What can a man say I'm on the run, just for your auditionin
Callin on you every night it's like you never listenin

[Beyonce]
You're the one that's switchin up gettin to specifics
When you say that I'm just dreamin I be rollin like a Michelin

[Mekhi]
Carmen you just trippin cause you know I love you infinite
Just so we could be here look at everything I did for this

[Beyonce]
So why you actin like that
You don't have to take it anymore fight back
I came to far to turn around and just hike back
Trying to get me sidetracked see me on the corner where the sign of the time
At

Chorus x2

[Beyonce]
And yo I came from the projects now I want the condos
Trying to be a star and now you messin up my cosmos

[Mekhi]
But you can't find something if you walkin' wit a blindfold
Carmen I can see right through you with my eyes closed

[B]Grown man to finance
[M]You actin like a nuisance
[B]You're the one that's in the club and tryin to do a new dance

[Intro: Beyonce & Consequence]
Damn that was so good I wanna buy him a short set
Uh, Uh, Cha'ya
Uh, Uh. It's the Cons' fool
Wor', wor', wor'

[Verse 1: Consequence]
I punch out hits, like Sugar Shane the new suga the game
And ain't nothin' sweeter by him or suger canes
I move suger queen, bought them 6 inch heels
And gotta feelin' like she livin' on the top of suger hills
And paid suger bills, now she calls me suga daddy
Cause I come through stunt in that suga white Cady
Bubble brown suga body Angelo
And Los Angeles, with a badda chick
Now she mad at Quence, cause of the game I run
So she wanna chew me out like suga the gum
But competition is nothin' so you really can't see me
Cause suga, I'm on a level that higher then Don Bredes
So you can eat your wheaties, Pop some suger smacks
Or sweeten up your coffee with dozen of suger packs
You still ain't no match for kid from Melby
When they sprinkle the club with more gees and suga tee
And yes indeed, he gots to be the all topsy
That killed the summer in that drop top B
So on the close n' open', forget the rope n' dough
Cause suga ain't knock em out, with the dopest quotes
Uh, uh

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I'ma be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store
I'ma be like a waffle cone that's dripping down to the floor

About to be up in the mall all night (Yes)
Whatever I get you putting it on (Yes)
Don't give me no lip let mama do it all

It's so good to the point that I'd
Do anything to keep you home
Baby what you want me to buy
My accountant's waiting on the phone (on the phone)
Just the thought of making love to you (you)
Dropping everything that's what I'll do (I'll do)
Whatever I get you putting it on (Boy)
Now take it off while I watch you perform

[Intro: Rory]
Right now inside the place to be with the one JAY-Z and Bey
Slowing down the dance to a different type of speed
You know it's Cool & Dre deh pan the beat
You know, a bloodclaat heat
(Right)

[Chorus: Beyonce & JAY-Z]
Let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans
To be in each other's arms, yeah
Let it breathe, let it breathe
I wanna drown in the depths of you, yeah, yeah
When the water's so blue (so blue, so blue)
So blue (so blue)
I need to take my time, oh yeah
Show you somethin' real (so real)
So real (let it breathe), so real (let it breathe, so real)
I want you to come inside right now
So you know just how I feel
How I feel (let it breathe, let it breathe), yeah

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
We never been this far from the shore
We might not ever go back anymore
Got you all in your emotions, hit you with the force then
Tell me your desires, I won't ever tire
You'd rather play the game than to throw the fight
Boy you know that ain't right
When I'm needing your affection, I need that attention
Up and down motion, come swim in my ocean, yeah yeah


[Chorus: Beyonce & JAY-Z]
Let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans

I wanna drown in the depths of you, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Where the water's so blue
So blue (so blue)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I brought my sand to the beach
Hopped out the Lam' with the sheep
Skin rugs on the floor
We hugged, made love on the seats
We tried to hide in the hills
We watched the sky turn peach
Summer's light like, summer's night
It's like, Christ masterpiece
She taste like Corona Light, sweet
Even the lime gotta squeeze
She gave me a lil' swig, to chase behind my weed
If I can stay in her hair forever, that'd be fine by me
I don't have no concept of time
Even with a rose gold Concept on me
I remember summer nights in the projects
Bullet rounds interrupting my Chi
When the worst thing that could happen
Zipped up his jacket and ran back down the street
In Bel-Air, only the nights get cold
I wrapped a yellow jacket 'round Bey
It's not lost on me, music has my kids sound asleep


[Chorus: Beyonce & JAY-Z]
Oh, let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans
To be in each other's arms, yeah
Let it breathe, let it breathe
I need to take my time to show you somethin' real (so real)
This is real (so real)
I want you to come inside right now
So you know just how I feel, how I feel
Let's make love in the summertime
Let's make love in the summertime
Be in each other's arms
Let it breathe, let it breathe
Let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans
To love in each other's arms, yeah

[Outro: Damian Marley]
Love, when
Love neva change you kno'
When people change change
You kno'
Love is unviversal ting
Love is going to express itself as a form of forgiveness and compassion for each other

[Intro: P. Diddy]
Yeah
There's three things I like about the summertime
Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Yeah
Hey yo, B
Tell 'em what time it is
Let' s go

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Out of all the guys that approached me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

[Bridge: Beyonce]
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to (oh)
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin


[Hook: Beyonce]
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now you are my prize
Wanna grow old with ya
Fill a house with ya pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

[Bridge: Beyonce]
I wanted more then just a man
I needed a friend
You are my best friend (yeah)
Someone I could talk to
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin


[Hook]

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
Yo let me holla at you for a sec
So what's in gonna be, him or me? (yeah)
We can cruise the world for pearls
And bare boots for girls
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit
Livin the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)
No worries you ain't gotta be stressed out
No hurries you ain't gotta be rushed out
Sit back relax ma take your time
Now have a taste of the finest wine
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me
And in your heart you's a "Child of Destiny" (that's right)
Them hot summers that we had especially
Love who you is girl, you bring out the best of me
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)
And that's your plan, where's your hand let me ice that
You my heart ain't no chance you could fight that
The summertime, when you hot baby take that, take that
Yeah..

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

[Bridge: Beyonce & (Frank Ocean)]

And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down


[Verse 2: Beyonce]
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower

[Verse 1]
Now that you're out of my life

But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
You thought I'd be sad without you
But I laugh harder

But I'm lastin'
You thought I would die without you
But I'm livin'


[Chorus]

Welcome to the wonderful world of Destiny's Child
I'm the Brat-tat-tat
My homeboy Den on the track
And we gonna lay you flat on your back
With the beat-boom-boom-pat-pat like that, y'heard me?
Now we comin' into this game like some survivors
And we leavin' this game like some survivors
So from now until we dead and gone we gonna be some survivors
Y'heard me? Beyonce where you at?
Uh!

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold 9 million

[Verse 4: Da Brat]
Uhh, c'mon, uhh
Now I done been through the storm and the rain
Climbed up the rough side and got tougher times, but I remain
Ya buff out the stuff to shine, And pull out the pump, protect mine
Survive in the game, Hate on me cuz you lame
They don't ever see your face or say your name
No more pain for me, No more misery, cuz you history
Imma hold on to what I got, Strap on my perfection, strap on protection
My own direction, born to be the best at what I do, I'ma make it through
Stompin like a soldier in my big black boots
I keep 'em "Jumpin, Jumpin," stayin funky, funky for you
No matter who's that man who walk out of your life
You don't need him, don't be no heathen
Long as I see you breathin', not leavin' for no reason
Seen 'em come and go once rich, they now po
No house, no mo, not even a condo
As long as I know how to love Imma stay alive, no need your game or style
They can't tame me cause I'm wild, not ashamed of stayin down
Can the rain sit, and on things chromed out, spit
And in my game, no doubt, I'ma get paid in a big way, survivor!

[SANTANA]
At first I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live
Without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

[MERCEDES]
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should've changed that stupid lock
I should've made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

[SANTANA]
Oh, now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one
Who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble?
You think I'd lay down and die?

[Intro]
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere

'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts

To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Yo, yo, Young Money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddy Krueger I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I'm rich, I could buy you
Kill bitches, leave their body in the Bayou
More brain than a IQ
More head than a dread, my youte
And my bank account ain't hardly empty
That's why I come through in a Barbie Bentley
So please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who's next to go?
My flows so flexible
Get gas, then get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, Plaxico
White jag with the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but "This is it!"
B-b-b-boo I'm everywhere
You're like balloon boy, mama, you was never there!
I am the Kung Fu Panda
Fuck all your blogs, fuck all your propaganda
Good for the goose, then its good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, Nicki is a brander
Please, you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn't even dare to be
So that's all folks, badabadee
I go hard, pause
Hospital flow, get more gauze
I'm a bad bitch on all fours
The President be like, "It's all yours!"
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem and the ring, the queen and the king

[Bridge: Beyonce & Lil Wayne]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part (No Ceilings!)
What kind of dream is this?
You could be a sweet--

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, kush it out, red bone, pussy, mouth
Eat you up, spit you out, fuck your girl in your house
I'm terrible, be careful, you might want say a prayer or two
So cold, I need theraflu, I'm so high, I need parachutes
I'm error proof, I'm never spooked, got my coupe, heaven blue
And my flag red as hell, think you're sweet as devils food
I never lose, my weapons use
Fuck with me wrong, shit get ugly, Devin Dude
And she's the queen, two's a couple, three's a scene
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams, get the pussy wet, Abita Springs
Hah, I'm Easter clean, shout to my home girl, Mika Means
Anything we want we redeem, you niggas gassed up, '93 Supreme
Nicki Minaj is the hardest bitch, more than an artist, bitch
She talk a whole lot of shit and walk around like she President Carter's bitch
She be on her Barbie shit, and me? I'm on Tha Carter VI
And I can turn crumbs to bricks, and I can turn nuns to tricks
Hah, Young Mula baby, f-fuck your feelings
And this is No Ceilings, yeah

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand
Now you won't stop calling me
You should've made some plans with me
Now you won't stop calling me
Kinda busy
Stop, stop, stop...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Beyonce]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore


[Verse 1: Beyonce with Lady Gaga]
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector, sorry, I cannot answer
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight, I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing
'Cause I'll be dancing, 'cause I'll be dancing
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to think anymore
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Now you won't stop calling me
Now you won't stop calling me
Now you won't stop calling me
Now you won't stop calling me
Now you won't stop calling me
Now you won't stop calling me



[Intro: All]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga

[Verse 1: Perrie & All & Jesy]
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, are you breaking up on me?
Sorry I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
Kinda busy, kinda busy
Sorry I cannot hear you I'm kinda busy

[Chorus: All & Jesy]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Stop telephoning
Me me me me me me me

[Verse 2: Jade & Perrie & All]
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone, won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my friends no faster
Should've left my phone at home cause this is a disaster
Call me a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

[Pre-Chorus: Perrie & All]
Not that I don't like you, I'm just tryna party
And I am sick and tired of my phone ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not taking no calls cause I'll be dancing
Cause I'll be dancing, cause I'll be dancing
Tonight I'm not taking no calls
Cause I'll be dancing

[Chorus: All]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor




[Verse 1: Beyonce with LeToya]
Why don't you just admit it?
'Cause I don't need your gratitude
And don't you try to hide it
Just tell me the truth
I can't go on this way, looking for something
That isn't there
Should I be on my way because I need
A reason for this mess

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Tell me
If you don't love me anymore
Just tell me
If you don't care about me anymore
Just tell me
If you don't want it
Just tell me (tell me)

[Verse 2: Beyonce with LeToya]
I never thought this day would come
But a test of love I need from you
Honesty's always seen through eyes
I wish you would believe
I'm giving you my all, but it's not pleasing
Your distant heart
If you respect my love, you'll hear my plea

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & (Beyonce)]
Tell me
If you don't love me anymore
Just tell me (won't you tell me)
If you don't care about me anymore (you don't care about my anymore)
Just tell me (tell me, if you don't want it)
If you don't want it
Just tell me
(Mmm)
(All you gotta do)
(All you got to do is tell me!)
Tell me
If you don't love me anymore
Just tell me (You gotta tell me if you don't care. I'll be on my way!)
If you don't care about my anymore
Just tell me
(I need to know) If you if you don't want it
Just tell me

[Guitar Break: LeToya]
Do do do do do do do do do do do
La la la la la la la la la la

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & (Beyonce)]
Tell me (Tell me)
If you don't love me anymore (If you don't love me)
Just tell me (If you don't need me, if you don't care
Boy, let me know)
If you don't care about me anymore
Just tell me
If you don't want it (baby)
Just tell me

[Outro: Destiny's Child]
Tell me, baby
Tell me, baby
Just tell me, baby

Turn my head, what did I see?
The fellas lookin' fly
And there was one that caught my eye
So I bit my lip, switched my hips as I walked by
Saying sexy boy, you're so fly

Oops, I forgot, I got a man

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I'm thinkin' to myself
'Should I even take a chance?'
'Should I do what's on my mind
Or should I stay down with my man?'
This boy he got me feenin'
And I'm wantin' him so bad
Should I chill one night with him and risk everything I had?
Saying sexy boy, you so fly
I wish I could give you a try
But my man's at home waiting for me by the phone
Sorry, can't get my groove on!

[Verse 5: JAY-Z]
I know you've heard I'm a gangsta
They say "Stay away from them gangstas"
They never change up, or pull they pants up
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don't let 'em push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before
This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like
For instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos and the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my glide
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That's why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hova and the letter B
How you like that, huh?

[Verse 1]
Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful

[Chorus]
I'm not wondering why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

[Verse 2]
Lovers used to make love
And died just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love
Wasn't it beautiful?

[Chorus]
Don't ask me why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

Diamonds used to be coal (Be coal)
Look young 'cause they got soul (got soul)
And my heart used to be cold (be cold)

That's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
Ooh

[Outro: Beyonce & Luther Vandross (Backing Vocals)]
(Come closer love)
Come a little closer so that we can see
Into the eyes of love
I want to see into those eyes of love
(Come closer, love)
Just a little closer let me speak to you
I want to softly tell you something
Here I am, here's my love, I just want you to...
(Come closer, love)
Come a little closer let me whisper in your ear
Cuz I wanna tell you something
I wanna whisper in your ear so softly...so come closer, love (Come closer, love)
Move on in real close so we can celebrate
The way we feel a bout each other's loving
I wanna tell you words, words of love...

[Beyonce']
You know you really, really, really, really
Want to be with me
So why don't you stop beating around the bush
And come and give it to me
Derek we can make beautiful music together
If you only stop resisting the only woman that you really want
And its not wifey

[Mekhi]
Hey! You're real social
I don't like the way you're looking
Don't get too close
I'm about to take you down to booking

[Beyonce']
C'mon and touch me D I know you want to

[Mekhi]
Look, I only need your prints
Don't really care about your frontal

[Beyonce']
I don't see me living another day
Without your tender kisses
Why don't we retire to the room
Put on some Luther, light some incents
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now

[Mekhi]
You trying to act like I'm not a cop

[Beyonce']
You can bring the cuffs, if you would like to
If that's your style

[Mekhi]
Looks let's get it straight, you cease and disist
I got some platinum bracelets
I'm about to squeeze on ya wrists

[Beyonce']
But you don't understand the way that I feel
The pain I could heal

[Mekhi]
I could lose my job for this
There is no way we could chill

[Beyonce']
So why you bring me this far
Now let's try to be real
Cause only time will reveal
If you still playing the field
Every second that you stay is like an hour we will
I got a couple days to kill
Either you down or you peel

I don't want anything without you in my life
You are my baby
Why don't you forget about your girl
And say you want me as your lady

Light-headed, feel ya eyes saying please don't go

Cause it's your steeze I need
My heart don't lie, come over D and feel my beat

[Mekhi]
Oh no! Cause I can see your skin is soft
You know, but I dont wanna pay the cost to be with you

[Beyonce']
You can't deny your feelings for us
You know it's true

[Mekhi]
I gotta go, but really now I'm feeling you
I wanna do it, but I don't
You know, I'd feel your thigh, but I'm so full of decency

[Beyonce']

There's only moments to see if it is to be...

The Proud Family
What

[Verse 1: Solange]
You and me will always be tight
Family every single day and night
Even when you start acting like a fool
You know I'm loving every single thing you do
I know that I can always be myself
Around you more than anybody else
Everyday as I'm heading off to school
You know there's no one I love as much as you

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Family, a family
Proud family
They'll make you scream
They'll make you wanna sing
It's a family thing
A family thing
Proud, Proud family
Proud Family
They'll push your buttons!
They'll make you wanna hug 'em
A family, a family
Proud, Proud family


[Verse 2: Solange]
I sleep tight, knowing that you're there
I look around me, you're everywhere
In my heart and even in my soul
You know I take you every single place I go
Everyday, I'm hanging with my friends
Got school, but when the day ends
I wanna feel the love I know is really true
I only wanna feel how I feel when I'm with you

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Family, a family
Proud family
They'll make you scream
They'll make you wanna sing
It's a family thing
A family thing
Proud, Proud family
Proud Family
They'll push your buttons!
They'll make you wanna hug 'em
A family, a family
Proud, Proud family

High split , fellas get the rise on me
Juss from the looks of it , I must say
Ya bound to get hooked , if you play

[Intro]
Destiny's Child

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame, soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize your beauty

[Verse 1: Kelly]
It was a Saturday, this cold afternoon
Inside this house there lived a frightened young girl
She didn't know what she should do
'Cause she missed her mother so
She was left home all alone with her stepfather

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame, soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize your beauty


[Verse 2: Beyonce]
He touched her places that he shouldn't have touched
He did some things to her that he shouldn't have done
So she ran into her room, paged her mother, 9-1-1
And the tragedy began for this young girl
She told her mother, her family and friends
No one believed her, 'cause before this happened
She was filled with hate and anger towards her step father
Cause he took her mother from her when they married

[Chorus: Destiny's Child (Beyonce)]
Please dry your eyes, young girl (Please, young girl)
Don't cry, you're beautiful (You're beautiful)
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame, soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize your beauty

[Verse 3: Kelly, with Destiny's Child, Beyonce]
She looked for her father in the men that she saw
Thought that all she had to offer was her body
No one could figure out why this young girl would live her life
In such pain and unhappiness cause she was so beautiful
She rebelled and one day the young girl fell in love
With another man like her stepdad
He abused her emotionally
And made her feel like she was worthless
I hope one day she realizes and see the beauty in her eyes
All she needs is prayer and strength
Cause she's beautiful


[Chorus: Destiny's Child (Beyonce)]
Please dry your eyes, young girl (I can't bear to see you cry)
Don't cry, you're beautiful (One more time)
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful (It's not your fault what he did to you)
You're not the one to blame, soon it will be okay
(I promise you'll be ok)
One day you'll realize your beauty

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful (Don't you know I love you girl)
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame, soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize your beauty

[Outro]
Don't hold your head down low
You've got so much, so much
So much, so much, so much to be proud of
You can still live your life
I promise you, you'll survive
Girl, I love you
You're beautiful



[Intro]
(Scoo - by - Doo)
It's that girl Solange (don't stop) and Murphy Lee
(Scoo - by - Doo - by doo)
We are the Scooby-Doo, uh oh, from that and mo', you know
(Scoo - by - Doo)
(Scoo - by - Doo - by doo)

[Chorus]
Thinking about you, where are you?
Cause I need to hear from you know (need to hear from you)
Is this a mystery, can't help but think
What is happening to you now?
Thinking about you, where are you?
Cause I need to hear from you know (need to hear from you)
Is this a mystery, constantly (don't think it is)
If you love me, Scooby-Dooby dooby doo

[Verse: Solange]
Where did my baby go?
Boy take that mask off
You used to be all upon me
Now you just trash talk
Split personlaity, pullin' 360's, don't even call me
It's such a mystery, my Scooby-Dooby dooby doo

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Scoo - by - Doo)
Murphy: Doo wop, doo wop

Murphy: Oh, oh, yo, yo, yo

[Verse: Solange]
Bring back my baby so
We can be like old days
I cannot take much more of
You and your silly ways
I'm tryin' to reach you, but I'm not Miss Cleo
You got me so confused, Scooby-Dooby dooby doo

[Verse: Murphy Lee]
You know my 7 digits
You know my address Solo come and visit
I'm just keepin' it realistic
I'm young so I'm gon' kick it from Atlantic to the Pacific
Forget it, I admit it, I only leave it to missin'
Now listen, meet me in Oklahoma
We take a private jet to West Bahamas
Mami wherever you want 'a just don't trip
We can dip just let me make it legit
Permission slip for permission to slip

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Scoo - by - Doo)
Murphy: Doo wop, doo wah

Murphy: Oh, oh, yo, yo, yo

[Verse: Murphy Lee]
C'mon Solo, you know I ain't your average young dude
You know I can go wherever whenever I want to
So if I could stop at Lou, she's mystery and confusion
Frequent flyer miles from St. Louis to Houston
I would do it, see most girls be kind 'a mad
Like Usher, "I Got It Bad," so introduce me to Dad
So we can, read the psalms, make clothes with ya Mom's
Thumbs up like the Fonz, Murphy Lee and Solange, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solange and Murphy Lee]
Uh oh, oh

Hang all the mistletoe, I'm gonna get to know you better

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I gave my heart to you
I gave up my friends like you said I should do
Put aside my smile for you
Threw out my dreams if you said you didn't approve
I gave my mind, compromised my life
Just to see I'd find
You were trying to hold me back
Slowly throwing me off of my track
Disappointed again

[Chorus 1]
I'm through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm finally giving it up
I've given so much in the past for a love I never had
I'm through with it
I'm, I'm through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm finally giving it up

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Oh there you go comparing me
To every little model on the TV screen
Oh there you go complaining to me
Cause I wanna spend time with my family
My esteem has gone down
You never wanna take me out
You make me feel dumb, and alone
I don't know where to go
I'm through with it

[Chorus 1]
I'm through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm finally giving it up
I've given so much in the past for a love I never had
I'm through with it
I'm, I'm through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm finally giving it up

[Verse 3: Kelly]
I shared all my secrets with you
Even when it hurt I told you the truth
I paralyzed my growth for you
I gave you control, felt so helpless without you
Couldn't be a friend to anyone happy
Cause with you I see misery loves company
I don't know if this is love
Cause if it's love I don't want it anymore
I'm through with it

[Chorus 1]
I'm through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm finally giving it up
I've given so much in the past for a love I never had
I'm through with it
I'm, I'm through with it (love)
I'm through with it, through with it (love)
I'm finally giving it up

[Bridge: Michelle]
Why do I feel so empty?
I'm crying out for some stability
Destroy my many insecurities
I'm breaking down somebody pray for me
Need a love like no other, not an ordinary love
Restore my joy, wisdom and courage
Lord I need your love
I found a new love
I found a new, found a new love
I finally found it in God

[Chorus 2]
I found a new love
I found a new, found a new love (I don't have to cry no more)
I found a new, found a new love (I don't have to weep no more)
I found a new, found a new love (I don't have to hurt no more)
I've given so much in the past for a love I always had
I've found a new
I, I found a new love
I found a new, found a new love
I finally found it in God


[Intro: Lil Zane & T-Bone]
Ah Yeah

Come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Lil Zane, T-Bone, Both]
For God I'm a slave To get to heaven Reverend said I gotta be saved
And behave And also stuck in my ways Give Him praise
Words can't express what I feel inside of my flesh
Every breath is giving Him glory until my death (I feel blessed)
Cuz everyday I'm seeing Him work (I feel blessed)
I don't wanna do no more dirt (I feel blessed)
If the path I was on was wrong (I feel blessed)
It's time to come home

[Verse 2: Beyonce, Melba Moore & Angie Stone]

If you can't see your way out And you're drowning in your regrets
If you have everything you want But you still can't find happiness
It's when you feel like you're forsaken Life can be so hopeless
Maybe you need to come home So your life can be cleansed

[Hook: Beyonce, Angie Stone & Melba Moore]
Callin on all of God's children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I've been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)

Screamin', "Free my nigga Meek Mill"
Niggas can't wheelie in this free world
Meanwhile Georgie Porgie Cinnamon sendin' me threats
Save your breath, you couldn't beat a flight of steps
Try that shit with a grown man
I'll kill that fuckboy with my own hand
And hop back in the coupe (Woo, woo)
Let's go back to the mud, I'll hop right out the suit
Save all that woopty-woop
Let's let the money talk, let the Uzi shoot
No jewels in this Patek Philippe
It's complicated, three million apiece
Sheesh, that's how we do time
Dujac by the mag, that's how we do wine
91 thousand for a wine bill
Keep it real with you, that was Juan's bill
My whole team ball
Everybody's a star but the team ball
'61 with the thing off
Me and Blue havin' a sing-off
That's a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
That's a vintage piece
Kind that make haters kiss their teeth, you can't buy this new
I had the 'Bach-bach-bach, you know how I do
Two-tone with the powder blue (Woo)

How I'm the only lady here, still the realest nigga in the room?
I break the internet, top two and I ain't number two
My body, my ice, my cash, all real, I'm a triple threat
Fuck it up and then leave, come back, fuck it up and leave again
Top off the coupe and it look like Freaknik
In the hood, hollerin', "Free Meek"
Two deep, it's just me and Jay
Just posted in them courtside seats
Woo, I'm like, "hol' up"
Woo, I might roll up
If they're tryna party with the queen
They gon' have to sign a non-disclosure, ayy

B, put the fuckboy on notice

[Verse: Beyonce]
I'm the only lady here, still the realest nigga in the room
I break the internet, top two and I ain't number two
My body, my ice, my cash, all real, I'm a triple threat
Fuck it up and then leave, come back, fuck it up and leave again
Top off the coupe and it look like Freaknik
In the hood, hollerin', "Free Meek"
Two deep, it's just me and JAY
Just posted in them courtside seats
Woo! I'm like "hol' up"
Woo! I might roll up
They're tryna party with the queen
They gon' have to sign a non-disclosure

[Chorus: Beyonce]
I took the top off the Maybach, yeah
I took the top off the Maybach
I took the top off the Maybach, yeah
I took the top off the Maybach, yeah
Ayy, I took the top off of my Maybach, bitch
I took the top off of my Maybach, bitch


Trust in me in all you do, have the faith I have in you
Love will see us through if only you trust in me
Why don't you, you trust me?

Come to me when things go wrong
Cling to me daddy and oh yeah I'll be strong
We can get along, we can get along
Oh, if only you trust in me

While there's a moon, a moon on high
While there are birds, birds to fly
While there is you, you and I
I can be sure that I love you

Oh, stand beside me, stand beside me all the while
Come on daddy face the future, why don't you smile?
Trust in me and I'll be worthy of you

Oh yeah, yeah, why don't you, yeah trust in me in all you do
And have the faith that I have in you?
Oh, and love will see us through if only you will trust in me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Why don't you, you come to me when things go wrong?
Cling to me oh and I'll be strong
We can get along, we can get along, oh if only you trust in me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, only if you trust in me



[Spoken: Beyonce]
Hey baby
I wish you could see what I have on right now
You so sexy
Imagine how intense it would be to hold me right now
Our song's playing

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt flow with my body
I can still hear your baritone in my ear
Telling me you'll take it slow
And I was in the mirror playing a role
Like you were here, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearing the same old song playing

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly]
Give it to me deeper
Giving me the fever
Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing
Oh, we tried to stand up
Hold me while my hands up
And the music kicks off
Fantasies were shook up
I'm thinking to myself again

[Chorus]
When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Outside I hear the rain on my window pane
Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
My mind, playing tricks on me again
I hear knocks at the door, is that my baby home?
Why couldn't it be reality?
Looked at the clock and it says 4:03
At nine, he'll be arriving on a plane
Then we'll be making love and hearing the song again

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly]
Give it to me deeper
You're giving me the fever
Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing
Oh, we tried to stand up
Hold me while my hands up
And the music kicks off
Fantasies with shirts off
I'm thinking to myself again

[Chorus]
When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

[Bridge: Michelle]
Ooh, boy I've been waiting
Got my body shaking
You're so deep, baby please, take it easy
I look at your face and
Got my heart racing
You're so deep, baby please, take it easy

[Spoken: Beyonce]
Keep it right there
Oh wait, wait...
Yeah, keep it right there
You driving me crazy

[Chorus]
When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

Red light special, undress me under the candle light
Turnt up in this business, watch me do all of them things you like
I'm ready to go, ready to blow like Grammy night
In the back of that limousine, Billy Bob and Angeline
All you gotta do, is say the word
And I'll be right there on ya
All you gotta do, is say the word
And I'll be right there for ya
Do this while I do that, we like "good, true that"
Come baby be you, get on it while I see you
Turnt up, all the way to the ceiling
Burnt up, till you ain't got no feeling
On my phone like Siri, talkin bout you gon kill it
Beat it up, until I black out; cash up, boy

[Hook: The Dream, Beyonce & (2 Chainz)]

[Verse 2: The Dream]
You're my black light special, she hotter than a flame tonight
Burn up in this, and watch you do all the things I like
Say you the reason why all of these rap niggas start singing
She say you the reason why all of these cute girls got babies
All you gotta do is say what's happening
And I'll be right there baby
All you gotta do is say what's popping
And I'll be right there shorty
My phone, like: "Siri, I told you I was gon killed it"
Got my chains all on that jelly; Where Michelle at? Where Kelly?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Got a picnic table my automo
Pull up, blow the horn and we gotta go

And I'm drinkin out the bottle man I'm gonna need a bib
Lookin like a kid tell you what it is
Tell you where to go man I tell you what I did
Ye ain't kickin it you get kicked out

And your body must be anticipated
Cause it already done leaked out


[Hook]



Go back to your den, Simba
I don't babysit


[Verse 1: Justin]
I woke up this morning
And heard the TV saying something
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me let me know that I'll be alright

[Chorus: Justin]
'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
Well, that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

[Refrain: Justin]
You got me singing (ohh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah)
Ohh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah
Everybody sing (ohh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah)
Everybody singing (ohh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah)

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Now if you ever wondering
About the way I'm feeling
Well, baby boy, there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessing
Sick and tired of trying to save the world
I just wanna spend my time being your girl
And what you give me lets me know that we'll be alright


[Chorus: Beyonce]
'Cause if your love was all I had (all I had)
In this life (oh oh oh oh oh)
That will be enough (enough) until the end of time

Rest your weary heart (ooooh) and relax your mind (OOOOOOOOH)

Until the end of time

Yessir

So let me talk my shit, nah mean?
(Coughing)
Okay, I'm good
Yeah

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I know you see the guap, 'cause getting money is what we on
Riding drop-top in the winter with the heat on
Bad yellow bitch keep my passenger seat warm
Leg hanging out the window, you ain't got these on
Bitch, holler! It is Lil Weezy
They cannot see me, they are like Stevie
I am bearing a ton like Levy
I circle your house like BB
Colder than the heebie-jeebies, never give freebies
Seventy-five thousand for these fees, shit
I can get a hundred thousand up in these jeans
Big stacks, my pockets on Cre-A-Tine
Young Money, DipSet, nigga, we a team
If you don't like it, nigga, fuck you, no Vaseline
Errr! I peel off in the Lamborghin'
Like a tangerine
Got the engine straight shaking like a tambourine
Like a bitch with some lips like Angelin'
-a Jolie, Holy God flow
I go where no other guy go
Fuck you, ho, I'm so 5-0-
4, I hope every snitch die slow
Hip-hop, that's my ho, I know
She know I like it wet, don't want no dry ho
Alright, bitch, I am the boy, no decoy
And I will straight up destroy any boy, or man
And I prefer money than bitches, or just reefer
We are Young Money, bitch, and I am the leader
He are: Currensy, Mack Maine, and D-Raw
And I just signed a chick named Nicki Minaj
And me, I'm still spittin' like a retard
And these niggas soft, they should be rapping in leotards
Nigga, we in charge, Baby put me in charge
And I'm just murdering niggas, free of charge
You dig? Just holler back, I see you, Sarge
I'm so motherfucking high, I can eat a star
Yeah, let me upgrade you
You may not be a model, but I can front-page you
You know I'm nasty, excuse my behavior
Let me just taste you, we can fuck later
Sitting in the coupe, looking like a racer
Top peeled back like the skin of a potato
Seat way back, listening to Anita Baker
Riding by myself, smoking weed by the acre
Hollygrove gator, ain't nobody greater
Leave you with some bulletholes the size of craters
You ain't heard the latest, Weezy F. the greatest
Battle anybody, nigga, fuck whoe'er your favorite
It's a new game, and I'm the coach like Avery
Leave it to the flow, we getting dough like the bakery
I don't really want to, but these niggas making me
Put a motherfucker on ice like the Maple Leaves
That's a hockey team, and I ain't on no hockey team
But I'm a champion-where's the fucking Rocky theme?
Damn, rest in peace, Apollo Creed
I'm a monster, every day is Halloween
A lot of syrup, lot of pills, and a lot of weed
And I keep my pockets green like a pod of peas
And if you hating, baby, you can get a side of deez
Deez nuts in your mouth, and can you swallow, please? Haha
Yeah, I'm so hot, I freeze
Big balls, and they jangle like a lot of keys
Even deaf bitches say "Hi" to me
She tell a blind bitch, and she say, "I gotta see"
Young Carter, darling
Understand: I am Michael Jordan balling, yes
I'm a dog, I'm a Hoya, homie
I'm a boss, your man's just an employer, mami

Let me upgrade you

How you gon' upgrade me?
What's higher than number one?
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block (Partner, let me upgrade you)

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
And I'mma help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies that's a good look)
Believe me
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
It take me just to compliment the deals (That's a good look)
And anything you cop, I'll split the bill

Believe me

Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade you (I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you)

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help, whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce]

(I can) up, (Uh huh!), (Can I?) up, (Let me) (HOV!) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you)  (Uh huh!)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (Hehe)

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels

Introduce you to some new things, and
Upgrade you (I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you

[Outro: Beyonce]
Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in ya necktie
Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond creamed facials
VVS cuff links, six-star pent suites
Partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, partna, let me upgrade ya (Huh!)

You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
I'ma help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies, that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
It take me just to compliment the deals (That's a good look)
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies, that's a good look)

[Chorus 2: (Beyonce & JAY-Z)]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you
Flip a new page, let me upgrade you
Introduce you to some new things, and (Uh!) upgrade (HOV!) you
I can (up), (Uh!) can I (up), let me, (HOV!) upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you,(Uh huh huh!)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (hehe)

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

[Chorus: Beyonce]
[Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you]
[Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things, and upgrade you]
[I can (up), can I (up), let me, upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you]

[Outro: Beyonce]
Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in ya necktie
Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond creamed facials
VVS cuff links, six-star pent suites
Partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, partna, let me upgrade ya (Huh!)

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Fixing up a car, driving it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, saying


[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

[Guitar Solo 1: Jonny Buckland]

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, whoa, oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, whoa, oh

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up

Believe in love...



[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
If Hov's a Blackberry Bold, shorty is a Sidekick
She used to have a man, I used to have a side chick
Shorty got wind, I had to blow the chick off
She got rid of him, they both took the shit hard
Shorty played the piano, me I played with white keys
Shorty from the South, oh I think she like me
Shorty like Pac, me, Big Poppa
She screaming "Hit Em Up," I'm screaming "Who Shot Ya?"
I'm on that red wine, shorty like white
Same shit, different toilet, we both getting nice
Me I'm from the Apple, which means I'm a Mac
She's a PC, she lives in my lap

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyonce]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Whether black or white, we both like Mike
We both like Jordans, we both Phil's Knight
I finish my breakfast, shorty's out to lunch
Yeah we both eating, it's better than brunch
Shorty like Pepsi, me I'm the coke man
Body like a Coke bottle, I crush it like a Coke can
Started at the window, end up at the wall
The Yin to my Yang, I skeet skeet off
In a salt and pepper 'Bach, shorty like to front
The Bonnie to my Clyde, both riding shotgun
Both covered in gold like C3P0
James and Florida Evans, let the good times roll

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyonce]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Thought shorty was the truth, found out she was a cheater
We were supposed to take over, I caught her bumping "Ether"
I thought shorty liked Mike, found out she liked Prince
Thought she was Adrian, it's been rocky ever since
My dollars was down, she left me for some Euros
Took my whole flavor, I call her Coke Zero
We were co-MVP's like Kobe and Shaq
Left me for the Heat, we were winning back to back
Said I party too much, shorty got fed up
Shorty got Britney, shaved her whole head up
We used to make out, kissing each other's face off
Fell for the Ponzi scheme, damn shorty just made off

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyonce]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars

[Intro: Beyonce]
I don't wanna wake, wake

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Excuse me? Um, I love you
Who starts a conversation like that? Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up or hide you
I'll get you out my mind, hmm, I try to
Why you? In my dreams, I knew
You knew how to be there, you knew how to treat it
You knew how to keep it, I wanna do more than touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you up to
We can leave right now, nigga, you don't need a duffle
La Perla, provocateur of secrets
How is it a secret if I know you're gonna peep it?
I see you peeking, don't wanna hear a peep
Wait

[Chorus: Beyonce & Pharrell Williams]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
You're such a dream
If you can believe?
Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Hey there, boy, I love you
I'm feeling like I know you, I can't help but wanna thug you
I'm watching all these broads trying so damn hard
But I can't even blame 'em 'cause you're so irresistible
I want to stand and yell, I won't ever dare to tell
I think I heard some wedding bells (keep that to yourself)
Is this real?
Ooh child, I can stop praying now
Past life, let's rewind
To the day when I met you
Throwback
Dear God, how could I forget you?
Your sex
Boy, it feels just like a dream to me
Now

[Chorus: Beyonce & Pharrell Williams]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh

If you can believe?
Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Beyonce & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter-
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because-

[Chorus: Beyonce & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the-, it's the curse of the-)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes


[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so...

[Chorus: Beyonce & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's-, it's true-)
But only when it freezes
(It's true-)


[Post-Chorus: Beyonce]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's-a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause-


[Chorus: Beyonce]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyonce]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"



[Nala]
Your reign is over, Scar
If you wanna get him, you have to get through us
Are you with me, lions?




[Intro: Salatiel]
Yeah
Shoot!

[Chorus: Salatiel]
Baby, oh, I'm not much of a talker
Baby, oh, can I drink from your water?
Baby, oh, meet me down by the river
We can dance to the rhythm
'Til the sun is high and the water runs dry

Oh, darling, if you leave, I'll go wherever you go
I'll wear your heart on my sleeve so everybody here knows
But if you tell me to stay, you'll never be on your own
So baby, don't wait too long

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Baby, oh, I'm not much of a talker
Baby, oh, can I drink from your water?
Baby, oh, meet me down by the river
We can dance to the rhythm
'Til the sun is high and the water runs dry

What are you waiting for? (Ashe)
Yes, we can make it far (Ashe)
Don't need inflatables (Ashe)
That's what the waves are for (Ashe)
What are you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I'll bring you back the moon just so we got all night
I'll bring the sun down too, so I can show you the light
Trust me, if you ever leave, I'll be right by your side, oh
For you, I will ride, ah

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams, Beyonce & Both]
Baby, oh, I'm not much of a talker
Baby, oh, can I drink from the water?
Baby, oh, meet me down by the river
We can dance to the rhythm
'Til the sun is high and the water runs dry

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams, Salatiel & Beyonce]
Yes, we can make it far (Ashe)
Don't need inflatables (Yeah, Ashe)
That's what the waves are for (Yeah, Ashe)
What are you waiting for? (Yeah, Ashe)
Yes, we can make it far (Yeah, Ashe)
Don't need inflatables (Ashe)
That's what the waves are for (Yeah, Ashe)
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Beyonce]
Baby, oh, I'm not much of a talker
Baby, oh, can I drink from your water?
Baby, oh, meet me down by the river
We can dance to the rhythm
'Til the sun is high and the water runs dry

Cardi

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I got that sauce and that water
Set them hoes in a corner
I wake up and get paid
Everyday in that order
Had some hoes that was hatin'
Now they act like supporters
In my face tryna make up
Like they Mike or Sephora
But I leave a bitch wet if I let up, she gon need a first aid at the Red Cross
Skrt, skrt dip off in a red Porsche
Everything on my list getting checked off
Wet neck, wet wrist I'm as wet as jet skis
They was sleepin' on a bitch now I'm a fucking wet tree



(*talking*)
(Shaggy) yo, uh-huh

You love a nigga, that's balling right (riight)
Thinking cutting, thugging right (riight)
To pick you up, and thug you right (riight)
I can hear you (uh-huh), I can hear you (uh-huh)
We like women that's classy, jazzy but nasty
With a ass, I can't let pass me (uh-huh)
I can hear you (uh-huh), I can hear you (uh-huh)

[Magic]
I'm the nigga, that you feeling befo'
Knock on the do', with a whole bottle of Mo
Smoking some dope, got a whole pocket of do'
If you ain't buzzed enough, we can get us some mo'
Bottle for you, plus I got a bottle for me
Chocolate filly's, so we can roll up the weed
Shhhh, you know what I came here fo'
We can do what we do, right here on the floor (uh-uh)
Cause the bed, might start squeaking
Plus you might start screaming, when your body start leaking (oooh)
And your kids, might start peeking
And I ain't plan on leaving, till later on this evening
Baby, we can make a movie
It'd be so groovy, baby if you do me
Do me babaaaaay
Like I've never been done befo', you know
Like I never had fun befo', you know
And I just might do you back, (fa real)
I don't think you're really ready, for that (yes I is)
Well come on baby, handle your biz

[Hook]

[Magic]
I like em smelling good, fruity and shit
Big cootie and shit, long as she can handle the dick (shut up)
I like to treat em good, feed em and shit
Treat em to shit, long as she can handle the dick (shut up)
I like to drive em, in the passenger seat
Close to me, long as she can handle me (shut up)
I like it, when I get they legs to shaking
No faking, sensitive her body aching (come on)
You like it when, a nigga do that there (oh yeah)
You like it, when a nigga touch that there (oh yeah)
You like it, when we make it thump
All rough and shit, nigga just slapping her up (come on)
You love it, when we in it for a hour
Coochie all swollen, you're ready for a shower (mmmm)
Who got the power, me that's who
Hush, 'fore you get a taste of deja vue (ooh)

You hear that, Beat Boyz

[Intro]
Yeah
What kind of world? Ah

[Verse 1]
(He's like)
Water when I'm thirsty
Even when I'm quenched, I still can't get enough
(He's like)
Fire when I'm cold
With just a simple touch, he warms me

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, storms come without a warning
If we get through this tonight, we can make it to the morning
Because if I can't be your girl

[Chorus]
Then what kind of world would it be without you?
Like a mountain so high to reach
(What kind of world?)
'Cause if we can't live in the sky
Then I might as well drown in the sea
(What kind of world?)
Finally my search is over and I found where I belong
But somehow we went wrong, oh

[Post-Chorus]
What kind of world? Ah
What kind of world?
(Oh, what kind of world? Yeah)

[Verse 2]
(He's my)
Air that I'm breathing
I don't need a reason, I would never leave him
(He's my)
Shelter from the rain
And I'll keep on clouded 'til we reach love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Storms come without a warning
If we get through this tonight, we can make it to the morning, oh
Because if I can't be your girl

[Chorus]
Then what kind of world would it be without you?
Like a mountain so high to reach
Said what kind of world?
'Cause if we can't live in the sky
Then I might as well drown in the sea
(What kind of world?)
Finally my search is over and I found where I belong
But somehow we went wrong, oh

[Post-Chorus]
What kind of world?
(Ooh, what kind of world?)
What kind of world?
(Oh, if you're not here with me, oh)

[Bridge]
See, the lesson I've learned is that love is all
And I would tear to burn to be proven wrong
So I keep on searching, keep on preaching, keep on praying
And I can't give up 'til I'm your girl

[Chorus]
So what kind of world would it be without you?
Like a mountain so high to reach
(So tell me, ah)
Said what kind of world?
'Cause if we can't live in the sky
Then I might as well drown in the sea
(What kind of world?)
Finally my search is over and I found where I belong
But somehow we went wrong, oh

[Post-Chorus]
What kind of world?
What kind of world?
What kind of world?
What kind of world?


[Verse 1]
How many people will have to die before we will take a stand? How many children will have to cry, before we do all we can?
If sending your love is all you can give
To help one live
How many times can we turn our heads
And pretend we cannot see
Healing the wounds of our broken earth
We are one global family
Just sending your prayers
Is something you'll feel
Helping one heal

[Chorus]
What have I got that I can give?
What have I got that I can give?
(Tell me)
What have I got that I can give?
(Hey-yeah, oh-oh)
To love and to teach you
To hold and to need you (hold and need you)
What more can I give? (what can I give?)

[Verse 2]
Brother to brother
Lay down our fears and reach out and make a pact
Show him the love that is in our hearts let us bring salvation back
Just sending your love has the power to heal
So let's all give


[Chorus]
What have I got that I can give?
(Is not allowed to give just a little bit)
What have I got that I can give?
(Everyone should be a part of it)
To love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?

[Verse 3]
Say the words
I'll lay me down for you
Just call my name
I am your friend
See, then why do they keep teaching us
Such hate and cruelty?
We should give over and over again

[Chorus]
What have I got that I can give?
(We should give over and over again!)
What have I got that I can give?
(Oh my god, oh my god)
(Oh my Lord)
See, to love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?
What have I got that I can give?
What have I got that I can give?
(give you, give to you)
See, to love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give?
What have I got that I can give?
(What More Can I give?)
What have I got that I can give?
(I wanna give to you, give it to you)
See, to love and to teach you
To hold and to need you
What more can I give
(they think I'm wasting my time now)
What have I got that I can give?
(To give it to you, we wanna give to you)
What have I got that I can give?
To hold and conceal you
To love and to heal you
What more can I give?
(Give me, give me one time more)
What have I got that I can give?
(What I got, what have I got)
(Say your prayers)
What have I got that I can give?
(Show the world how much you really care)
To love and to teach you
(To love you, teach you)
To hold and to need you
(To hold you, to need you)
(What more?)
What more can I give?
What have I got that I can give?
(What can I give? Tell me what can I give you)
What have I got that I can give?
To hold and conceal you
To love and to heal you
What more can I give?

[Verse 1]
Babe
Gotta know one thing before you ask my name
Be straight up and tell me what's your aim
A girl like me, see I don't play no games, no no
That's why I say
If you wanna be with me, go all the way
Do what you gotta do, just let me state
Is it real or is this just a fake? (tell me)

[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby?
Wanna get to know me?
What's really good, baby?

Been near the hood lately?
Where you from and where you be?
What's good with you, baby?
What's good with you, baby?

[Verse 2]
Babe
You're sittin' over there, tryna figure out what to say
Make up your mind right now, don't contemplate
You know that I don't have time to waste, no no
Where do we go?
What this thing could be, we'll never know
There is just no way that we can flow
If you ain't being honest from the go (tell me)


[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby?
Wanna get to know me?
What's really good, baby?
Do you have a lady?
Been near the hood lately?
Where you from and where you be?
What's good with you, baby?
What's good with you, baby?

[Bridge]
Don't try playing with my mind
Boy, I don't have no time
For something that I know ain't good for me
Don't hesitate to say
You feel the chemistry
I wanna know, should I take a chance with you?

[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby?
Wanna get to know me?
What's really good, baby?
Do you have a lady?
Been near the hood lately?
Where you from and where you be?
What's good with you, baby?
What's good with you, baby?


[Chorus]
What's good with you, baby?
Wanna get to know me?
What's really good, baby?
Do you have a lady?
Been near the hood lately?
Where you from and where you be?
What's good with you, baby?
What's really good, baby?

[Outro]
What's good with you, baby?
What's really good, baby?
Been near the hood lately?
What's good with you, baby?

Tell me what's it gonna be


[Verse 2]
Can we take it there?
Club is about to close
Gimme one more dance and I'm ready to go
And the DJ's playin' all the same songs
And the night is about to end
Can we meet in the parkin' lot?
Find a quiet place where we can talk
To find out more about each other
Baby can we?

I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Can't you feel this chemistry?
(What's it gonna be boy?)
It's so damn crowded, we should leave
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Tell me what's it gonna be


[Outro]
(What's it gonna be boy)
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me
What's it gonna be boy?
What's it gonna be boy?
What's it gonna be boy?
(Tell me what's it gonna be)
What's it gonna be boy?
What's it gonna be boy?

Verse 1: Jamie
When I first saw you
I said oh my
That's my dream
That's my dream
Oh, I needed a dream
When it all seemed to go bad
Then I find you
And I have had the most beautiful dream
Any man's ever had

Verse 2: Beyonce
When I first say you
I said oh my
That's my dream
That's my dream
Oh, I needed a dream
To make me strong
You were the only
Reason I had to go on

Hook:
You were my dream
All the things that I'll ever knew
You were my dream
Who could believe they would ever come true
And who could believe
The world would believe
In my dreams too


Bridge: Jamie
Before, you appeared
Life was only a game
And day in
And day out
Were the same, oh

Beyonce:
Now a dream
Coming true
Like a star
See it shine

Both:
A dream
That is yours
That is mine

Jamie:
You were my dream

Beyonce:
Now I got dreams of my own
Dreams you'll never know

Both:
You won't take my dream from me


When I first saw you
I said oh my
I said oh my
That's my dream

[Verse 1]
If the storm comes, if we burn up
If the wells run dry
You're my reason to believe in
Another life

[Verse 2]
If it all ends, and it's over
If the sky falls fire
Best believe me, you will see me
On the other side

[Verse 3]
And if the earth shakes
Like the big 'quake
And our lives flash by
You're the first thing
I'll be seeking
With these arms of mine

[Verse 4]
And when we're older
And we're ready
To leave Earth behind
Here's to hopin'
It's exactly
At the same damn time

[Verse]
When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you
If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star as dreamers do



[Intro: LaTavia]
Oh, baby, where'd you go?
I need you back wit' me
Oh, baby, where'd you go?
I need you back wit' me, uh

Where'd you go? (Where'd you go?)
Where'd you go? Oh no
(So, baby, please come back to me)

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
It has been five days
You haven't called me
Do you still want me?
Still need me?
Am I on your mind?
Are you thinking of me?
Are you missing me like I miss you?
Crying constantly
Runnin' out the reasons
Why I haven't heard from you, I'm worried
Got me doin' crazy things
I can't even sleep
Gotta get you back to me

[Chorus]
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Thinking of everything
That you told me
Said you'd never leave me, deceive me
Got my mind thrown off
Did you just use me?
Boy, you confused me
Gonna lose me
I can't deal with all the pain
And hell you put me through
Cause I'm still missing you
Wanna be wit' you
Without you here, I'm breaking down inside
Oh, baby, tell me why
Why did you hurt me, hurt me?

[Chorus]
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you

[Breakdown]
(Destiny's Child, help me out)
It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me

[Chorus until fade]
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know (I used to know)
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse 2]
I'm (I'm), dreaming (Dreaming)

[Intro: Spoken]
Now, now, now, honey
You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids
And the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?

[Hook]
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me?
When I make me so damn easy to love
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me?
When I make me so damn easy to need?

[Verse 1]
I got beauty, I got class
I got style, and I got ass
And you don't even care to care
Look here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that

[Hook]
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

[Verse 2]
I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now now now now now now
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune
Ooh

[Hook]
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me?
When I make me so damn easy to love
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me?
When I make me so damn easy to need

[Verse 3]
There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely
There's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain
Dumb


[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Chapter one, LAX departure
Flight 1106, he sat right next to me
Chapter two, he was cute so I asked him
If he had a lucky lady claimin' him
Chapter three, he made it clear that he was single
And he was searchin' for a partner just like me
Chapter four, we landed and he said we just can't end it
'Cause he needed a little more time wit me

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonce & (Destiny's Child)]
(Weeks later we datin', takin' me all kinda places)
Showing me things I never seen
(It was kinda crazy, I'm relatin' to this man)
So I gave him every hidden secret part of me
(Oh, then it switched what is this overheard your messages)
When I questioned you, you said she's a friend
(Now it's funny that I'm runnin' into you, is that your group)
Nigga tell her I'm your main event, oh

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Why you actin' like you don't know who I am?
After all the trips, all time we spent
Now you act like we weren't doin' it
Why you actin' like you don't know
Girl I know your man
I drove his whip, I bought his rims
And I know it's gone hurt you provin' it
Why you actin' like you don't know who I am?
After all the trips, all time we spent
You gone act like we weren't doin' it
Why you actin' like you don't know?
Girl I know your man
After all the trips, all time we spent
And I know it's gone hurt you provin' it


[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Think I'm lyin' his mama, Mrs. Parker
And I sat down in the den and watched Comic View
Think I'm lyin' his boxers, he likes to wear Calvin Klein
With the open front fly design size 32
Think I'm lyin', I never could describe his birth mark
If I never did let him hit and get into this
Think I'm lyin', I can even tell you your size
'Cause you left your bra behind in his bathroom, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland & (Destiny's Child)]
(Weeks later we datin', takin' me all kinda places)
Showing me thing I never seen
(It was kinda crazy, I'm relating to this man so I gave him)
Every little secret part of me
(Oh, then it switched, what is this overheard your messages)
And I questioned you, you said she's a friend
(Now it's funny that I'm runnin' into you is that your group)
Partner tell her I'm your main event, yeah

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Why you actin' like you don't know who I am?
After all the trips, all time we spent
Now you act like we weren't doin' it

[Bridge: Michelle Williams]
See you makin' it harder for the other man
When a real woman try to let you in
Now she lookin' at me, thinkin' I disrespect
But that's not my way girl 'cause I wasn't raised like that
You accusin' me, should be checkin' him
Insecure of me 'cause I dealt wit him
Woman to woman I ain't got time for foolishness
I'm out the door, this is my cue, I can't go through with this

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Why you actin' like you don't know who I am?
After all the trips, all time we spent
Now you act like we weren't doin' it
Why you actin' like you don't know?
Girl I know your man
I drove his whip, I bought his rims
And I know it's gone hurt you provin' it
Why you actin' like you don't know who I am?
After all the trips, all time we spent
You gone act like we weren't doin' it
Why you actin' like you don't know?

After all the trips, all time we spent

Girl I know your man
After all the trips, all time we spent
I know it's gone hurt you provin' it

[Verse 1]
This is how I feel, about Christmas
It's the smell of pine, it's the Christmas lights
It's the feeling of God, it's that good ol' egg nog
It's the blessed faces, it's them happy babies
It's the family prayer, it's that new V.S. underwear
It's that anxiousness, it's that gratefulness
It's that broke shiz-nit after givin' all them gifts

[Chorus]
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise

[Verse 2]
What this Christmas means to me, spending my time with my family
Knowing it's a season for giving, running downstairs for Mom's cooking
Send Christmas love to the ones you know, kissin' your man under the mistletoe
Spreading love to everyone, and thanking God for the birth of His Son

[Chorus]
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise

[Verse 3]
Snowing and it's cold outside, wrapping gifts by the fireside
My family is here, Christmas day is here, its that very special time of the year
Blessed time, a joyous time, it a giving time, a feeling time
It's a happy time, a laughing time, sharing this winter paradise


[Chorus]
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise

[Verse 4]
It's your gifts you give, it's your relatives
It's your kids in the back room, it's that good home-cooked food
It's the Christmas color, it's the stocking stuffer
It's the impatient nights, winter paradise

[Chorus]
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise

[Outro]
La-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haughing
La-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haughing

Oooh Oooooh
Oooh Oooh
On A star

And I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we can spend
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow

I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
Whether or never
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
(Let's get together, baby)
Whether or never


And I'm wishin on a star
To follow where you are
And I'm wishing on a dream



I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm

Wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Was interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit
Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick?"
Maintanin, it's the same old thang
A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed
I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?
She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye"
I was too deep for you from day one
Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares
Into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports
To take us away from here, but I cut too much
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
My sinners used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll
Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

[Verse 1: Jessica Simpson]
As I'm lookin' in, lookin' the mirror, I see
Life is really here to be with me, oh

So now I tell myself that I am thinking strong
I see the beauty lying within my soul

Doesn't matter what you do to me, do to me, oh no
Honest people; there's a possibility
To tell you my real reality


[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Jessica Simpson]
The face that I see (Oh-oh)
It's the woman in me
It's the woman that I wanna be

Don't underestimate the woman I become
The woman I am
So now I tell myself that I'm thinkin I'm strong
And I see the beauty lying within my soul

[Chorus until Fade: Destiny's Child & Jessica Simpson]

The places you've never been, I'll take you

But you feel so damn real to me
Come take the lead
Enjoy this world with me

[Chorus]
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)

[Verse 1]
You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watchin' me, baby
I was watchin' you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you
You ask me where I'm from
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you

[Chorus]
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)

[Verse 2]
Certainly you can call me, baby
I love to hear from you
Yes, of course you can come and see me, boy
I want to get to know you more
I'm feelin' you
No, baby, not yet, we can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset?
Boy, you act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful, mmm, mmmm

[Verse 3]
You was at my house
I was sittin' on my couch
You was really buggin''
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve
You too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move too slow
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It's cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
'Cause you show me your true face, baby
The first time I said no

[Chorus]
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes

Posted in the back, got my fangs and my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
And every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down

High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yonce all on his mouth like liquor
Yonce all on his mouth like liquor
Yonce all on his mouth like liquor
Yonce all on his mouth like liquor
Like-like liquor, like-like-like liquor
Yonce all on his mouth like liquor

[Intro: Kelly Rowland]
Ladies, y'all wanna do it again
Bey, go on Michelle

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
I really hate to see that look on your face
You're lookin' like someone came and rained on your parade
And I know it kills to feel those tears in your eyes
But I guess your conscience finally caught up with your lies
But when my tears dropped, where the hell were you?
But it's okay, boy, I've changed, and I ain't been there waiting
So I won't pretend to feel bad for you
Cause since you left, I ain't cried since
And boy, I like it that way

[Hook: Kelly Rowland]
I can say "I'm done" in a million ways
But let's not beat around the bush, let's cut to the chase
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late
And now I'm so through, too cool, oh yeah
And if our love was a game, you just lost
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I know you hate to see this look on my face
I'm sure that you can see real clear, a little lying goes a long way
And if you think I'll waste my tears, boy you're crazy
And maybe you should get yourself admitted, don't delay
But you let the bomb drop, too bad for you
But it's okay, boy, I'm straight, my whole life's amazing
So I won't pretend to feel bad for you
Cause since you left, I ain't cried since
And boy, I like it that way

[Hook: Kelly Rowland]
I can say "I'm done" in a million ways
But let's not beat around the bush, let's cut to the chase
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late
And now I'm so through, too cool, oh yeah
And if our love was a game, you just lost
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late

[Verse 3: Michelle Williams]
Now you wanna claim you got a clue
Boy, what'd you expect for me to do?
You claim you wanna have a life or two
But you can save your "sorry's" and your "I love you" too

[Hook: Kelly Rowland]
I can say "I'm done" in a million ways
But let's not beat around the bush, let's cut to the chase
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late
And now I'm so through, too cool, oh yeah
And if our love was a game, you just lost
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late

[Outro: Kelly Rowland]
Change just in time
Just in time for me to change my mind
And it's too late
Boy, I changed
It's too bad for you, oh-oh
For I changed my mind
I don't want you no-no more
'Cause see, you changed, I changed
You changed, but it's too late, it's too late
Sorry

[JAY-Z]
Can I get some light in here?
Cellphones in the air

[Intro: Beyonce]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the stars
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man (sing)

[Chorus: Beyonce & JAY-Z]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young (yes)
Do you really want to live forever?(ah)
Forever and ever (sing)
Forever young (young) I wanna be (yes)
Forever young young ah
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happened to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today 'cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut we'll be fine, ah
(Sing)

[Chorus: Beyonce & JAY-Z]
Forever young young I wanna be
(Forever young) (yes)
Do you really want to live forever? yeah
Forever and on top ever
Forever young I wanna be
(Forever young) yeah, yeah
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever young

[Verse 2: JAY-Z & Beyonce]
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping out of Porsche's
Popping up on Forbes lists, gorgeous, hold up
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking more shit
I be talking more shit, I'm nauseous, hold up
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, baby, bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet I'm painting you a portrait

[Chorus: Beyonce & JAY-Z]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young yeah, yeah
Do you really want to live forever?
And ever and ever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever your time, sing!
(Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever)
One more time, sing!
(Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young)

[JAY-Z]
Make some noise for Beyonce one time Brooklyn

Thank you for tonight, thank you for tonight
I love you


[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm young Khalifa
I'm young-I'm young Khalifa (x7)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
All about my money if you not, I'll see you later
I take out the first two letters and say "Ha-ha" to you haters
I got rooms with elevators
Yeah, they say I'm futuristic
Got a iPhone for business but the Sidekick's for the bitches
Haha

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Stupid swaggered up, niggas mad at us
All my niggas rep that gang and my bitch she bad as fuck
Hair down her back, Religion always true
My president is black, my head coach too
Oooh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Tatted like a Mexican, fresher than a freshman
Pocket full of Benjamin's, how much ain't a question
Wouldn't believe how many older women that be crushing
Never quick to make a scene to me that's really nothing


[Hook]

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Claim your flow insane but niggas not so sick
Let 'em heat up 'fore I eat 'em
Hope the pot don't stick
And my nikes don't fit, but my jeans do
Apoligize for shitting on you niggas I ain't mean to
I see life in plain view I'm looking out the window
Liquor, Swisher, Tips and that bitch to fluff my pillow
California trips got me on some different swag
If you didn't know who I was, I bet you know it now
Yeah

[Hook]

[Chorus]
You're the only one and I think
About you all the time
Every day and night
I can't seem to get you off my mind
You're the only one I'm thinking of

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I want you to know that nobody else will get the chance
At getting close to me baby its you
Youre all that i need
You are all I need

[Chorus]
You're the only one and I think
About you all the time
Every day and night
I can't seem to get you off my mind
You're the only one I'm thinking of

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I used to think that love was
Something that was only for the others
But lucky ones but now
I see it's me for you, baby
Never gonna let you go


[Chorus]
You're the only one (and I can say)
And I think about you all the time
(Me and you, baby, that's all I'm thinking lately)
Every day and night
I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Can't seem to get you off my mind)
You're the only one I'm thinking of

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You're the only one and I think
About you all the time
Every day and night
I can't seem to get you off my mind
You're the only one I'm thinking of


You're the only one I'm thinking of
You're the only one for me

You're the only one I've ever loved
The only one I'm thinking of
Only one I'm thinking of

Only, only one for me

[Chorus]
You're the only one and I think
About you all the time
Every day and night
I can't seem to get you off my mind
You're the only one I'm thinking of

[Narration: Beyonce]

I sometimes wish I could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else
Before I was famous I was the girl on the heel with the guitar
I was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach
And now that I'm famous, it's really really difficult to do very simple things
I think it's the hardest thing to give up
But my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim, never make excuses, never expect anyone else to provide for me things I know I can provide for myself
I have dreams, and I feel like I have a power to actually make those dreams a reality
When you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore, you become the property of the public
There's nothing real about it

Just look at these dazzling women
The finest representatives of our nation
Ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown

You can't put your finger on who I am
I can't put my finger on who I am
I am complicated
I grew up with a lot of conflict, and drama's, and I've been through a lot just like everyone else
My escape was always music and I'm so lucky that that's my job
But if I accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with, it would be worth nothing
You know, you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter
You have to have something that is forever
Something that's invisible

I was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable
And I always felt like it was my job to fix the problem
People pleaser, but I'm no longer afraid of conflict and I don't think conflict is a bad thing
Because I know that when you grow up, when you learn a few things , you're no longer afraid of letting go, you're no longer afraid of the unknown
You're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable
And it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say "I like that person," you know?
If I hadn't gone through, you know, some of the painful experiences in my life, I would not be me
And I feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary
I watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective
We do not value ourselves enough
Especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are
I've always been very very specific and very choosy, very choosy about what I do with my body and who I want to share that with
People feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way
There's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life
I always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it
When, honestly, it's very simple
It's just when, you know, a person that believes in equality for men and women
Men and women balance each other out, and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other
I have a lot of empathy for men, and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created, especially for African-American men
I have the same empathy for women, and the pressures we go through
The woman has to provide so many things for their children
I consider myself a humanist

You know, everybody's not good at everything
You know, it's OK to depend on someone
It's actually what we're supposed to do
We're supposed to depend on each other
And when you find the person that you trust and you love
And you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you
It is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life
Happiness comes from you
No one else can make you happy
You make you happy
And one thing that's for sure:
The love I have for music, for my husband, for my child,
Is something that will last far beyond my life
