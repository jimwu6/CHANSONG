[Verse 1]
In the year of '39
Assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darlin', we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me


[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Outro]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand
For my life still ahead, pity me

[Verse 1]
This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street

[Refrain]
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me

[Verse 2]
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let-down
Coming to this town honey is a showdown

[Refrain]
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
Still, there's a feeling, this world is using me

Oh, we've gotta learn to learn to love to live

Living in your mind's living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race

Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me

They were talking in whispers
In bear skins and fur
Captain Scott and his heroes to be
To have laboured so long
To have made it this far
Ooh it's been such a long ride

For a human human human

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado 'bout nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day

[Chorus]
All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone
All dead

[Chorus]
All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All dead and gone

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child

[Chorus]
All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead and gone

[Outro]
All dead and gone


[Intro]
So all you people give freely
Make welcome inside your homes
Thank God you people give freely
Don't turn your back
On the lesson of the Lord
All prime ministers (yeah)
And majesty around the world
Open your eyes, look, touch and feel
Rule with your heart
(Rule with your heart )
Live with your conscience
(Live with your conscience)
(Love) Love, love and be
(Love) Love, and be free
We're all God's people

Gotta face up, better grow up
Gotta stand tall and be strong
Gotta face up, better grow up

[Bridge]
Yes, yeah
Yes, there was this magic light
I said to myself
I'd better go to bed
And have an early night
Then I, then I, then I
Then I went into a dream
Rule with your heart
And live with your conscience

[Chorus]
We're all God's people give freely (yeah)
Make welcome inside your homes
Let us be thankful, he's so incredible

(Out of the doorway, the bullets rip)
(Repeating to the sound of the beat, hey)

Yo, hold your breath (And another one gone)
Hold your breath (And another one gone)
Hold your breath (Another one bites the dust)
Yo, check it


[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean (& Freddie Mercury)]
If you're a soldier at ease
My military style is known to murder Nazis
Brooklyn to Germany (Oh yeah) come on
My kamikaze will blow the U2
They hire Idi Amin in Timbuktu
Whether you Hindu, or do the Voodoo
You can't foresee this unless I bring the previews, yeah, yeah
Yo, it's the number one rappin' band (Come on)
Yo, this review will be critically acclaimed
Leave you in critical pain, clinically insane
The name Wyclef Jean, with a yes, yes y'all
Better have a vest y'all, I'll blast, and bless y'all (Oh yeah)
F-y'all, the mark of the beast, the triple six
Time running out, listen to the tick (Oh yeah)
If you see what I saw, then you seen what I seen
If you know what I know, you know what I mean (Oh yeah)
Commanding officer of the Navy SEAL team
Once I give the orders, you feel the infrared beam (Oh yeah) Blaow!
For all you critics, sayin' "another remake"
(Another one bites the dust)
Yo, if you know the deal, this is the master reel, kid

Yo, for the love for the cash, I'll blast you in my path
Keep my eyes on the math, you cats don't know the half (Oh yeah)
As far as I'm concerned, you cats can burn in flames
This ain't no game, I'mma start callin' names (Oh yeah)
So come get me, if you know the one-fifty
A million refugees ready to bust with me (Oh yeah)
Bloody, filthy, in this rap shhh—
You gonna have to kill me, since you can't beat me (Oh yeah)
Pras, Dirty, Cash, you're the greedy
Believe me, you gotta let me fly like R. Kelly (Oh yeah)
Bite another dust with my man Freddie Mercury
What height nineties got ya cash, wannabe crazy (Oh yeah/Navy SEAL!)


[Alternate Verse 5 (music video): Canibus (& Freddie Mercury)]
Yo, I know you wanna see the Can-I-Bus bite the dust
So you could bury my body below the Earth's crust (Oh yeah)
But I'm a Small Soldier, to stay as focused
With guts, I rip the scab off of layin' the cut (Oh yeah)
I'm an extraordinary military mercenary
Searchin' for extra intelligence like steady (Oh yeah)
My rhymes cut through the radio waves like machetes
The predator becomes the prey in the Serengeti (Oh yeah)
I breach national security purposely
To safely return the statue of Freddy Mercury (Oh yeah)
Verbally, Wyclef, Pras and Free
Holdin' it down for the Refugee Navy SEALs Team (Oh yeah) (Navy SEALs)

[Verse 6: Free (& Freddie Mercury)]
Practically, I tactically destroy
Deploy more decoys than a presidential convoy (Oh yeah)
My whole envoy stay camouflaged out
And when I walk the street, I take the refugee route (Oh yeah)
This one go out to all my thugs in the borough
Soldiers stay thorough, like Kilamanjaro (Oh yeah)
Split it with an arrow, my girl platoon roll
Outta control, the female Mandingos (Oh yeah)
Free, I evolve from the egg of a seminarian
Don't go down, 'cause I'm a vegetarian (Oh yeah)
And when I bust, it ain't "in God we trust"
And if you bring a gun, you better bring a black tusk (Oh yeah)

[Outro: Wyclef Jean, The Product G&B (& Freddie Mercury)]
She looked into my eyes and said FBI
(Another one bites the dust) (Oh yeah)
She said she loved me, she was a spy who lied
(Another one bites the dust) Right
I could relate, could you relate?
(Another one bites the dust)
Jerry "Wonda", The Product (Oh-oh) (Another one bites the dust)

Smoking chimney tops

And the dream of the child
Is the hope of, the hope of the man

Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

Back chat, Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat, Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat, Back chat, and you always get your way

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah, see what you've done to me

[Verse 1]
Backchat, Backchat, you're driving me insane
It's a battle to the end, knock you down, you come again
Talk back, talk back, you've got me on the rack
Twisting every word I say, you wind me up and get your way
Fat chance I have of making a romance
If I'm ever gonna win, have to get the last word in
Take it from there, twisting every word I say
Huh, wind me up and let me play

[Chorus]
Back chat (oh yeah), Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat (huh), Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat (hey), Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat (yeah), Back chat, and you always get your way

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Wake up, stand up and drag yourself on out
Get down, get ready, scream and shout
Back off, be cool, and learn to change your ways
'Cause you're talking in your sleep and you're walking in a daze
Don't push your luck with me, I'm ready to attack
'Cause when I'm tryna talk to you all you do is just talk back
You stand so tall you don't frighten me at all
Don't talk back, don't talk back, don't talk back
Just leave me alone
Hey

[Chorus]
Back chat, Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat (huh), Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat, Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat, Back chat, and you always get your way

Yes, you do, ah
Yes, you do, baby, c'mon!
Back chat, Back chat
Back chat, Back chat (C'mon)

Back chat, Back chat

Send shivers down my spine
Body aching all the time

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go

Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Part II: Radio Gaga]

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I hеard it on my radio
You gave them all those old timе stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio, everybody

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 2]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga

Radio goo goo, radio ga ga

Bu gerçek hayat mı ?
Yoksa sadece fantezi mi?
Iki arada kalmış
Gerçeklerden kaçış yok
Gözlerini aç, gökyüzüne bak ve gör
Ben sadece sefil bir çocuğum,sempatiye ihtiyacım yok
Çünkü sempati benim
Çünkü ben haydan geldim,huya giderim , biraz aşağı biraz yukarı
Rüzgar ne yönde eserse essin gerçekten önemli değil


Anne, sadece bir adam öldürdüm
Başına silahı dayadım, tetiği çektim ve o şimdi ölü
Anne , hayat daha yeni başlamıştı
Ama gidip her şeyi mahvettim
Anne ,ooh,  seni ağlatmak istemedim
Eğer yarın bu zaman dönmüş olmazsam
Devam et , hiç bir şey olmamış gibi dur
Çok geç, zamanım geldi
Omurgam beni sarsacak titreşimler gönderir,  durmadan ağrır tüm bedenim
Herkese elveda, gitmem gerek
Hepinizi geride bırakmam ve gerçekle yüzleşmem gerek
Anne ,ooh, ölmek istemiyorum
Bazen hiç doğmamış olmayı diliyorum



Küçük bir adam silueti görüyorum
Övüngen tip ,övüngen tip , fandango dansı edecek misin?

Asilzadem, ben sadece sefil bir çocuğum ve kimse beni sevmez
O sadece sefil bir çocuk sefil bir aileden
Bu ucubelikten ayırın onun hayatını
Haydan gelen huya gider, bırakın da gideyim
Bismillah! hayır, seni bırakmayacağız
(Bırak gitsin) Bismillah! Seni bırakmayacağız
(Bırak gitsin) Bismillah! Seni bırakmayacağız
(bırak gideyim) seni bırakmayacağız
(bırak gideyim) seni bırakmayacağız (bırak gideyim) oh
Hayır,hayır ,hayır, hayır ,hayır,hayır,hayır.......
Tanrım aman tanrım ,bırakın gideyim


Şeytan bir iblisini benim için ayırdı
Demek beni taşlaştırıp gözümden  vurucaktın
Demek beni önce sevip sonra ölüme bırakacaktın
Oh, bebeğim  bunu bana yapamazsın
Buradan çıkıp gitmek zorundayım ,buradan çıkmalıyım
Hiçbir şeyin önemi yok, bunu herkes görebilir
Hiçbir şeyin önemi yok
Benim için hiçbir şeyin önemi yok
Rüzgar ne yönde eserse essin.....

You're taking all the sunshine away
And making out like you're the main line, I knew that

'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart, uh-huh
Feeling the beat of my heart

[Chorus]
Ooh, you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh, you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Ooh, messing with the beat of my heart

[Bridge]
Ooh, you used to be a mean kid
Mm, making such a deal of life
Ooh, you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen?
No, you're speeding too fast
Slow down, slow down, you'd better slow down
Slow down

[Verse 2]
You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove, yeah

[Intro]
What planet is this, mmmh?
Let there be rock and roll

[Verse 1]
It is a Saturday night and I am home alone
With the music on quiet I am flying solo
Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat
Put the music up loud hear it in the street
Then the neighbours start banging on my front door
Throw the door wide open saying what is your point
Come on in let us rock this joint

[Chorus]
We got the whole house rocking[x5]
To the mighty power of rock and roll

[Verse 2]
We dance out of the door, dance into the street
And all the people are swaying to the musical beat
We rock down the road and down to the town
And all the people stare and smile and get down
Then the police man is saying "stop this noise"
But the beat takes over now he is one of the boys
The beat's taken over now he is one of the boys
Come on down let us rock this town


[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let us go
Let it roll
Are you ready?
Said are you ready?
The Cosmos Rocks

[Verse 3]
Across seven seas through the Panama
Now they are rocking on beaches and they are rocking in bars
Do not ask me how and do not ask me why
From Miami Beach down to old Bondi
There is a rock and roll fever in every place
Next thing you know they'll be rocking out in space


[Chorus]
Come on down let us rock this place
Come on down and
Sock it to me

[Outro]
We got the whole world rocking[x5]
To the mighty mighty mighty power
We got the cosmos rocking[x2]
We got the universe rocking
We got the cosmos rocking[x2]
To the might power of rock and roll

Come on, baby, you gotta know why
Ha, take off!

[Chorus]
Dancer, dancer
I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me ?

Cool

[Verse 2]
You're the life and soul of the funk-tion
It took me all night
To get hold of the right introduction
Blew me out of sight
I taste your lipstick
I look in your eyes
You feel fantastic
My body cries


[Chorus]
Dancer, dancer
I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, dancer

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah
Fool always jumpin'
Never happy where you land
Fool got no business
Take your livin' where you can
Hurry down the highway
Hurry down the road
Hurry past the people staring
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry

[Chorus]
Leave on time, leave on time
Never got your ticket
But you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Gonna get your ticket
But you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Put it in your pocket
But you never can tell

[Pre-Verse]
Leave on time, leave on time
Shake that rattle
Gotta leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Fight your battle
But you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
You never got a minute
No, you never got a minute
No you never, never got
Oh no matter


[Verse 2]
Fool got no business
Hangin' round and tellin' lies
Fool, you got no reason
But you got no compromise
Stampin' on the ceilin'
Hammerin' on the walls
Got to get out, got to get out
Got to get, oh
You know I'm going crazy

[Chorus]
Leave on time, leave on time
Got to get ahead
But you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Gotta head on ahead

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Hey-hey
Oh, oh

I wanna get paid, I wanna get paid
Gotta leave, gotta leave
Gotta leave ya, oh!


[Pre-Verse]
Leave on time, leave on time
Gotta get rich
Gonna leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
But you can't take it with you
When you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Gotta keep yourself alive
But you leave on time
But you leave on time
Leave on time, dead on time

[Outro]
*Thunder Clap*
You're dead!

[Verse]
So dear friends your love is gone
Only tears to dwell upon
I dare not say as the wind must blow
So a love is lost, a love is won
Go to sleep and dream again
Soon your hopes will rise and then
From all this gloom life can start anew
And there'll be no crying soon

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
(Ah) You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money
And you want more
Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

[Chorus]
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Killjoy, bad guy
Big talkin' small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good? Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide? (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good? (Feel good)


[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
(Ah) Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
A dog with disease
You're the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Know-All
Was the fin on your back part of the deal? Shark!

[Chorus]
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart (You never did)
Of your own (Right from the start)
Insane, should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Make yourself null and void
Make me feel good (I feel good)



You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you preach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money
And you want more

Misguided old mule with your pig headed rules
With your narrow minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

[Chorus]
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You've never had a heart, of your own

Kill joy, bad guy, big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss
My ass goodbye!

Feel good, are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?
(I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good feel good?

You talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide

A dog with disease
You're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is
Mister know-all
Was the fin on your back
Part of the deal? (shark)

[Chorus}
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You've never had a heart (you never did) of your own
(right from the start)

Insane, you should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null and void
Make me feel good
I FEEL GOOD!


[Verse 1]
Delilah, Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You're irresistible
You make me smile
When I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope
You make me laugh and I like it
You get away with murder so innocent
But when you throw a moody
You're all claws and you bite
That's alright!

[Verse 2]
Delilah, Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You're unpredictable
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go
To sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over
My Chippendale suite

[Bridge]
Delilah, Delilah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eye
Meeow meeow meeow
Delilah, I love you, Delilah


[Verse 3]
Ooh, you make me so very happy
You give me kisses
And I go out of my mind, ooh
Meeow meeow meeow
You're irresistible, I love you, Delilah
Delilah, I love you

[Outro]
Hah-hah
You make me very happy
Oh yeah
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your, your, your kisses
I love your kisses

Hey, you say you won't you can't give me any more love

[Verse 1]
If you're searching out for something
Don't try so hard
If you're feeling kind of nothing
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
You feel the need to find some answers
You can leave it for another day
Don't try so hard

[Verse 2]
But if you fall and take a tumble
It won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble
Thank your lucky stars
Just savor every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging 'round you
Stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Oh, don't try so hard
Oh, don't take it all to heart
It's only fools, they make these rules
Don't try so hard


[Verse 3]
One day you'll be a sergeant major
Oh, you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey, but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dress as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd

[Bridge]
Oh, what a beautiful world
This is the life for me
Oh, what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me

And from what I've seen it's hot, it’s-a mean

[Chorus]
I'm gonna use my stack
Gimme the reh....
It's gotta be bad, baby
Got a dragon on my back

[Verse 2]
Take me to the room where the beat's all round
Gonna eat that sound, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah
Take me to the room where the black's all white
And the white's all black, take me back to the shack


[Chorus]
Gonna take no prisoners
Gonna give me the business
Got a dragon on my back
Hey, it's a dragon attack

[Outro]
Look at me
Oh
Oh oh
Ha



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy, hmm
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
You've left me like a broken toy

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey, though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you

[Chorus]
Oh take me, take me
Take me to the dreamers' ball
I'll be right on time
And I'll dress so fine
You're going to love me
When you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me, take me
Promise not to wake me
Til it's morning, it's all been true

[Bridge]
What d'you say about that, hey honey?
You gonna take me
To that dreamers' ball?
I'd like that
Right on that 42nd street
Way down, downtown dreamers' ball

[Chorus]
Oh take me, take me
Take me I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely
Perceptible whisper
Gently take me
Remember I'll be dreaming
Of my baby at the dreamer's ball

[Outro]
Take me, hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamers' ball
I'll meet you at the dreamers' ball




[Verse]
Oh, I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy, hmm
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
You've left me like a broken toy

Oh, it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey, though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you

[Chorus]
Oh take me, take me
Take me to the dreamers' ball
I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine
You're going to love me when you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me, take me
Promise not to wake me 'til it's morning
It's all been true

[Bridge]
What d'you say about that, hey honey?
You gonna take me to that dreamers' ball?
I'd like that
Right on that 42nd street
Way down, downtown dreamers' ball




[Chorus]
Oh take me, take me
Take me I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me
Remember I'll be dreaming of my baby
At the dreamer's ball

[Outro]
Take me, hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamers' ball
I'll meet you at the dreamers' ball




[Verse 1]
It's the sad-eyed goodbye
Yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street
Weak-kneed partings I recall

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the mistier mist, the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays

[Chorus]
There's all the more reason
For laughing and crying
When you're younger
And life isn't too hard at all

[Verse 2]
It's the fantastic drowse
Of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings
To waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a vertical hold
All the things that you're told
For the everyday hero
It all turns to zero

[Chorus]
And there's all the more reason
For living or dying
When you're young
And your troubles are all very small

[Bridge]
Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk
With endlessly restless feet
And half of the time
We'd broaden our minds more
In the pool hall than we did
In the school hall
With the downtown
Chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife
The lights and the fun

[Verse 3]
Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain’t easy for a smalltown boy
It ain’t easy at all

[Outro]
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached
For breakfast I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror
Now who else do I like?
Brian May

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
Yo

I was a terror since the public school era
I was a terror since the public school era

Long before you were born

Joyful the sound
The word goes around
From father to son, to son

Your country to be
Just keep building
On the ground that's been won

And the word goes around
From father to son, to son

But you'll write it all again
Before you die, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
One, two, three
Woo

[Verse]
Gotta get rid of this feeling, I'm feeling done
Yes, I've gotta get rid of this feeling that's under my tongue (Keyset)
I've been waiting so long, I've got to be all the fingers and thumbs
Oh, sitting all alone with just a feeling, I'm feeling bad
Yes, that feeling is driving me, it's driving me mad
Oh, now that I'm here, got to give you all that I ever had
Sure do

[Bridge]
Now that I'm here, I can see you so clearly
It's the way I should say it
It's not what I say, it's the way that I say it
It's not how I play, it's the way that I play it
Ooh, wooh, wooh, yeah, I feel, yeah

[Outro]
Now, that I'm here
Oh, got to get a rid of this feeling I'm feeling inside, yes
Got to get you into that feeling that's driving me mad, alright, baby

Stop

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, alright
Every day, every night

I know you wanna, you wanna hide

I feel like, I feel like, I feel like
Do you know it, know that, know that
Come on baby, you give me the come on
I love you, baby, come on and let's make it right

Funny things happen, I don't know what you're talking about
Make you, you make me
I'm gonna wish that I had
Just you, just you, I want you, I love you
It's been so hard
Take it into your eyes
Feel like

Give me the pieces, pieces of your heart
I love you, I love you, love you, love you, love you
And make a big start
Brand new start
Let's make a brand new start

Ooh, let's make a brand new start
I'm giving you that broken heart
Oh, I need you baby

Oh, come on and take me
'Cause I need your
I need your loving

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey you, boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you
Know what you're doin'?
You think you're gonna
Set things to rights
You're just another picture
On a teenage wall
You're just another sucker
Ready for a fall

[Chorus]
You gotta fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, aah!
Fight from the inside
Right down the line

[Verse 2]
Hey you, boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you
Know what you're doin'?
You think that out
In the streets is all free
You're just another money-spinner tool
You're just another, fool


[Chorus]
You gotta fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, Aah!
Fight from the inside
Right down the line

[Outro]
Right down the line
Right down the line



Every single day, I got a heartache comin' my way
I don’t wanna say goodbye
Baby but look at the tears in my eye
I don't wanna say goodbye
Mama but look at the way you made me cry
Every way that's nice
You show you’ve got a heart that's made of ice

And I know
Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes, to make a poor man's heart break
A poor mans heart break

Baby you turn me on
But as quick as a flash your love is gone
Baby I'm gonna leave you now
But I'm gonna try to make you grieve somehow

Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break
A poor man’s heart break
And my heart is breakin’ too

I don't wanna say goodbye baby
But look at the tears you made me cry
Every way that’s nice
You show you've got a heart that's made of ice
And I know

Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes to make a poor mans heart break

Fire, fire and water must have made you their daughter
Baby you’ve got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break
Heart break

Baby and my heart is breakin'
Oh my heart is breakin'
Oh listen

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
"Dislocate your spine
If you don't sign" he says
"I'll have you seeing double"
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off

[Chorus]
Flick of the wrist
And you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist
He'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs
And then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

[Verse 2]
"Intoxicate your brain
With what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself," he says
"Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried"

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize
(Big-time money, money)
Reduce you to a Muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off

[Chorus]
Flick of the wrist, and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself," he says
"Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried"

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off

[Verse 3]
Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize, (big-time money, money)
Reduce you to a Muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off

[Chorus]
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had


Brian: It's called 'Flick Of The Wrist', thank you

Dislocate your spine if you don't sign he says
I'll have you seeing double, double
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise ...

Don't look back;
Don't look back

Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
Dig in the ribs, and then a kick in the head
Taken an arm, taken a leg...
All this time honey
Baby, you've been had

Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
"Prostitute yourself", he says
Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you 'til you've dried


Don't look back;
Don't look back:
It's a rip off

(instrumental/guitar & piano solo)

Work my fingers to my bones
Scream with pain
Still make no impression

Seduce you with his money-make- machine
Cross-collateralize
Reduce you to a muzak fake machine
And then the last goodbye, bye, bye, bye

Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
Dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
Taken an arm, taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby, you've been had

(Roger: Tah, good job ...

Freddie: Thank you, thank you
Now then, ha, ha, ha, well your guess is right
Right now we'd like to do something new for you actually, it's about four pieces that we've put together, a sort of a medley, uhm, three of them are on our new album 'Sheer Heart Attack', thank you, which is now racing up the charts, thanks to you...)

Dialogue:
Ming: Klytus, are your men on the right pills? Maybe you should execute their trainer?
Flash Gordon: 41, 42
Dale Arden: Go Flash go, go Flash go, go Flash go, go Flash go

[Verse 1]
Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped
And the children are created
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash
And leaving you with the lumber

Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike
What you need is a rest
It's not easy, love
But you got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hands
'Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end

A letter from your lover
Only a phone call away

You're getting used to life
Without him in your way

In time for tea

Funny how love is the end of lies
When the truth begins
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love
In the shape of things
That's what love is
That's what love is

Funny how love  can break
Your heart so suddenly
Funny how love came tumbling down
With Adam and Eve
Funny how love is running
Wild and feeling free
Funny how love is coming home
In time for tea

Funny, funny, funny

From the earth below
To the heavens above
That's how far and funny is love
At any time, anywhere
If you gotta make love
Fo it everywhere
That's what love is
That's what love is

[Chorus]
Funny how love is everywhere
Just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere
You're bound to be
Funny how love is every song
In every key
Funny how love is when you
Gotta hurry home 'cause you're late for tea

Funny, funny, funny how love is

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love
In the shape of things
At any time, anywhere
If you got to make love do it everywhere

From the sprinklers
It also left a man's decapitated body
Lying on the floor
Next to his own severed head
A head which at this time
Has no name
I know his name...

Here I am
I'm the master of your destiny
Ha-ha

Your so-called leaders of your land
I'll eat them whole before I'm done
The battle's fought and the game is won

I am the god of kingdom come

And I try so hard
And I play so much
And only one more win
And my dreams comes true

We are the globals, my friend
We won a lot of matches to be here, global elite
We are the globals, not silvers, not golds
But we are the globals
This is great

[Verse 2]
But it was not easy
So many cheaters
So many trolls wants to ruin your game
And Russians guys
But if you really want
To be global elite
You must have very big balls
This is true, ooh, ooh

We are the globals, my friend
We won a lot matches to be here, global elite
We are the globals, not silvers, not golds
But we are the globals

[Verse 1]
Take good care of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

[Verse 2]
Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her
Won't you keep me company?
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, marry me for evermore
We'll be good company


[Bridge]
Now marriage is an institution sure
My wife and I, our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door

[Verse 3]
I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts
My own limited company

[Chorus]
I hardly noticed Sally
As we parted company

[Bridge]
All through the years
In the end, it appears
There was never really anyone but me

[Verse 4]
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe
But no one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity


[Chorus]
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company



[Verse 1]
I can dim the lights and sing
You songs full of sad things
We can do the tango, just for two
I can serenade and gently play
On your heart strings
Be a Valentino, just for you

[Chorus]
"Ooh love, Ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy"
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good
Old-fashioned lover boy

[Verse 2]
Ooh, let me feel
Your heartbeat (Grow faster, faster)
Ooh, can you feel my love heat? (Ohh)
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish
Is my command

[Chorus]
“Ooh love, Ooh lover boy
What’re you doing tonight? Hey boy”
Write my letter, feel much better
I’ll use my fancy patter on the telephone

[Bridge]
When I'm not with you
Think of you always
I miss you
(I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you, Love you
Hey boy where do you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion
In the good old fashioned
School of lover boys

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty-first of May
Died syphilis forty-four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes, he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know, people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

[Verse 2]
Now hear this
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg? Will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care anyway
Come on, come on, the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you (Ah, yes, I told you)
And that's no lie (Oh, no, no)


[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?

Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
(Hit it!)

[Bridge]
Now listen, all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what Mama says
Not a word, not a word Mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side and said
"You're going to realize tomorrow"


[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
No, I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come, come on, the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?

What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come, come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you once before

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?

[Verse 1]
Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty-first of May
Died syphilis forty-four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes, he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

[Verse 2]
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care anyway
Come on, come on, the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you, ah yes I told you
And that's no lie


[Chrous]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
People
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Let me show you

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know, people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Hit it

[Bridge]
Now listen, all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word, not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realize tomorrow


No, I'm not going to tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come, come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you once before

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?

Great King Rat died today
Born on the 21st of May
Died syphilis 44 on his birthday

Every second word he swore
Yes, he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Now would you like to know
A wouldn't you like to know
A wouldn't you like to know
Great king rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Ow

Where will I be tomorrow
Will I beg, will I borrow
I don't care anyway
Come on, come on, the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you
And that's no lie

Would you like to know
A wouldn't you like to know
A wouldn't you like to know
Great king rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Let him show you, ha


Ooh yeah

Now would you like to know
A wouldn't you like to know
People:
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now, what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Hit it
You bugger you

Now listen, all you people
Throw out the good and keep the bad
Very soon you're gonna be in the bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
And very soon you're gonna be a disciple

Don't listen to what your mama says
Not a word, not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival, sure
The great Lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
Said 'you're going to realize tomorrow'


No, I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come on, come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before
Yes, and that's no lie

Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

[Instrumental fade-out]



[Intro]
And you're rushing headlong
You've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And there's nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do, no
There's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can, nothing you can
Nothing you can do about it

[Chorus]
And you're rushing headlong
You've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping, no
There's nothing you can do about it
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Hey, he used to be a man
With a stick in his hand
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
She used to be a woman
With a hot dog stand
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings
You're gonna lose your rag
You're getting in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy
When you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap B-movie!

[Chorus]
Headlong, down the highway
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And you can't stop rocking
And there's nothing you can, nothing you can
Nothing you can do about it

[Verse 2]
When a red hot man
Meets a white hot lady
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
Soon the fire starts raging
Gets you more than half crazy
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
Ooh, now they start freaking
Everywhere you turn
You can't start walking
Cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Because reason's out of the window
Better hold on tight

[Chorus]
You're rushing headlong
Headlong
Out of control (yeah!)
And you think you're so strong
There ain't no stopping
And there's nothing you, nothing you
Nothing you can do about it at all

[Guitar solo]
Yeah, yeah
Alright, go!

[Chorus]
And you're rushing headlong
Down the highway
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
There's nothing, nothing
Nothing you can do about it, yeah

[Outro]
Ha ha
Headlong
Yeah, yeah, yeah (rushing)
Headlong
Headlong
Headlong
Gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh


[Intro]
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone

[Verse 1]
In these days of cool reflection
You come to me
And everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine

[Chorus]
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free
This world could be one

[Verse 2]
In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days
Of cruel rejection, hmm
You come to me
Soothe my troubled mind


[Chorus]
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This should be love for everyone, yeah
This world should be free
This world could be one
We should bring love
To our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, this could
Be heaven for everyone

[Bridge]
You know that
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone

[Verse 3]
Listen, what people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone

[Outro]
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone

On(on) and on(on and on), does anybody know another hero
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on

[Verse 1]
Lights, cameras, action
On me I'm the main attraction
High off life, match one
This is only the beginning, act one
They dont wanna see me act up

But this the real world, drinking like roofy
Doubt if I remember tonight roofy

But I'mma make sure they remember me
Running like I got the legs of a centipede

In the game im the star athlete
Kobe, no LeBron actually
No need for a act three
I breathe
Master piece

Rap's Scorsese
I'm your hero but who gon save me
And the story goes

[Hook]

Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day
Just minding my business thinking my thoughts
Nothing much to say
When suddenly I got hit
Imagine my surprise
Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Stuck in the traffic
Stuck at the lights what do I see
Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me
She takes off
Imagine my disgust
Like a bat out of hell
I get to eat her dust
I never had known anything to compare with her laugh
I'd never known anything that counted by half
My heart got hijacked by you

Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Steals my heart

Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart


Look at the cities
Look at the streets what do you see
Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be
Suddenly hit by something they don't get to choose
It comes out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Hijack my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you know you won't let me be
Stole my heart
Threw away the key
Oooee baby what's become of me
You hijacked my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
Hijack my heart

This is the way I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, o-oh, when you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone
I can hear music
I can hear music

Sounds of the city baby seem to disappear
Oh well I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

Loving you it keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain,oh no,the way I'm feeling inside
You look at me we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again
I can hear music
I can hear music

Sounds of the city baby seem to disappear
Oh well I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music


Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near



[Chorus]
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Ooh, but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road
To get hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying, "baby, it's all right"
When deep inside
You're really petrified
Lover turns to hater on this escalator

[Chorus]
I can't live with you
Yeah, but I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay
But I can't bare you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you

[Verse 2]
We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
We can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves

[Bridge]
Hold on, baby, tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doing what we gotta do, yeah
I can't live with you
I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But baby, I'll never ever leave you

[Chorus]
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
'Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh, and everything about you
I can't live with you
No, I just can't live, I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah, and I can't live without you
Through the madness
Through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years, yeah!

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, I can't live
Without you, yeah, yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Oh, I can't live without you
Baby, baby, baby
Without you, whoa yeah
I can't live without you




I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Ooh but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you

Yeah I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road to get hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator

I can't live with you - yeah
But I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you

We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin' what we gotta do - yeah

I can't live with you I can't live with you
I can't live I can't live
I can't I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh and everything about you

No I just can't live I just can't live

Through the madness through the tears

Oh oh I can't live without you baby baby baby
Without you

[Verse 1]
Keep your chin up
When you're feeling lonely
Don't let 'em get you down
Ain't no use in your sitting
All alone, hanging around
For someone to call, oo-oo-ooh
They won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide
Even if it hurts you inside
So I said, "give as good as you get"
Yeah!

[Chorus]
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Come on, go
Get up!
Hey-hey!
It sure feels good


[Verse 2]
Keep your big hands off of my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're taking me out to wine
And dine me, trying to wind
Me 'round and around and bind me
To your legal contract (Ha ha!)
Rumour has it that you can play it dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do
About that, that yeah!
I'll play you at your own game!
Yes

[Chorus]
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
That's good
Play it again!

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
Oh, you'd better do it
Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
It's everyone for themselves!

[Outro]
Move on out!
Hey! Hey
Oh, I like it!
Rock 'n' Roll ready! Yeah
Woo-hoo!

[Intro]
Yeah
Ha ha
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I took my baby dancing
To see a heavy band
But never saw my baby till the encore
She had the singer by the hand
I didn't wanna cry 'cause I had to be cool
Didn't wanna tell you that you're much too cruel
Did you have to run off with that dog-gone fool?

[Chorus]
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't mind the postman
If the neighbours didn't know
Or the gas man, electric man, a man who'll fix the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock and roll clone
And leave me like a sucker standing all alone
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?
Go ahead, fool


[Chorus]
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

[Bridge]
So I ain't gonna go to see the Rolling Stones no more, no more
I don't wanna go to see Queen no more, no more
So I ain't gonna go to see the Rolling Stones no more, no more
I don't wanna go to see Queen no more, no more

[Guitar Solo]
Yeah
Yeah!
Go crazy, woo!
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna hurt you
Like you've been hurting me
But you know that I'll be watching, rolling on the floor
Next time you're on the TV
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoiled brat
To think that I nearly let you get away with all that
No way, baby


[Chorus]
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

[Outro]
Ooh!
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta stay away from me, baby
Baby, crazy, crazy, crazy, yeah
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, woo!



You stabbed your knife right in my back
Was it just something that I might have said
Does this mean we're falling out
I guess this means that our love has fallen out
If you wanna make a go
I guess we're falling out
It was just one gone and gone away
I guess we're falling out
Guess we're falling out
Da, da, da, I wanna stay

(An ad-libbed verse)
I guess we're falling out
It was just one long race
I guess we're falling out
Falling out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, falling out, falling out, yeah
Two, three, four
Make it a whole, a whole, a hey
On, and on, and on babe
Ohh
Yeah, yeah, it's a
Falling out
Hey
Make it a whole, a whole, a hey
On, and on, and on babe
Ohh
Yeah, yeah it's a
Falling out, falling out, yeah
Two, three, four
I guess we're falling out
It was just one gone and gone away
I guess we're falling out
Guess we're falling out
Da, da, da, I wanna stay




[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh, so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you, oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink, my dear
To be honest, you haven't got a clue

[Chorus]
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, oh-woah
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear

[Verse 2]
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not at my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree

[Chorus]
Oh dear, I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, uh huh
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast, it's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear, how about you?

[Chorus]
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened, oh yes
It finally happened

[Outro]
I'm slightly mad
Just very slightly mad
And there you have it




[Verse]
The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumping
And the hubcaps all gleam

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When my hand's on your grease gun
Oh it's like a disease, son

[Chorus]
I'm in love with my car
Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

[Bridge]
Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks
Saying this is the end now
Cars don't talk back
They're just four-wheeled friends, now

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruising in overdrive
Don't have to listen
To no run-of-the-mill talk jive

[Chorus]
I'm in love with my car
(Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
Got to feel for my automobile (Ooh)
I'm in love with my car
(Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
String back gloves
In my automolove (Ooh)


[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Roger Taylor]
The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumping
And the hubcaps all gleam

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
With my hand's on that grease gun
Oh it's like a disease, son

[Chorus 1]
I'm in love with my car (Oh, oh yes)
Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks saying this is the end now
Cars don't talk back, they're just four-wheeled friends, now

[Audience Cheering]

[Live Impromptu Song]

[Audience Cheering]


[Instrumental Intro]
One, two, three, four
Ooh, ooh!

[Verse 1]
While the sun hangs in the sky
And the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea
And meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars
And the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain

[Chorus]
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying, yeah
Just passing our time
Ooh, ooh!

[Verse 2]
While we live according to race
Color or creed
While we rule by blind madness
And pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition
Superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on


[Chorus]
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
We'll tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time!

[Bridge]
Through the sorrow
All through our splendor
Don't take offense at my innuendo

[Spanish Interlude]

[Bridge]
You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything
You think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego, be free
Be free to yourself

[Instrumental Break]
Ooh, ooh, yeah!

[Verse 3]
If there's a God or any kind
Of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason
To live or die
If there's an answer to the questions
We feel bound to ask
Show yourself, destroy our fears
Release your mask


[Chorus]
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey, tread that fine line
Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whatever will be, will be

[Outro]
(We'll just keep on trying)
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time!

[Verse 1]
Monday
Start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Tuesday
Saw her down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me

[Bridge]
Wednesday, I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday
My luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name

[Chorus]
I never thought that this
Could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade


[Verse 3]
I wish Friday
Would last forever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there

[Bridge]
Saturday
Just twenty-four hours
Oh no, I'm going back
Home on Sunday

[Outro]
I'm so sad alone



[Instrumental]


[Intro]
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

[Verse]
I live my life for you
Think all my thoughts
With you and only you
Anything you ask I do, for you
I touch your lips with mine
But in the end, I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
What more can I do?

[Chorus]
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
(I leave it to you)
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

Leave it in the lap of the Gods

[Verse 1]
It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky, but I gotta chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing
To laugh about
My money, that's all
You wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

[Chorus]
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

[Verse 2]
No beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and
Forgive me when I ask
You where do I belong
You say I (You can do it)
Can't (You can do it)
Set you free (You can go and set him free)
From me, but that's not true

[Chorus]
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

[Instrumental]


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Just look at all those hungry
Mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law?
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created

[Verse 2]
You know that everyday
A helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care
Inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man
Is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by


[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?
If there's a God in the sky, looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that he created?



[Applause]

[Verse 1]
Just think of all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devasted
Right to the bone
If there is a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created

[Applause]


[Verse 1]
Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law?
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created

[Verse 2]
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Oh

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?
If there's a God up in the sky, looking down
What must he think of what we've done
To the world that He created?

Waiting for life to go by
Oh

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone
If there is a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created

[Audience Applause]




[Intro]
Howl at the moon

[Verse 1]
Just think of all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded?
Against our own
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created

[Verse 2]
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man, sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Ohh!

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated?
Right to the bone
If there's a God, up in the sky looking down
What must he think of what we've done
To the world that He created?


[Verse 1]
It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining, I feel good
And no one's gonna
Stop me now, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
It's a beautiful day
I feel good, I feel right
And no one, no one's
Gonna stop me now, mama

[Outro]
Sometimes I feel so sad
So sad, so bad
But no one's gonna
Stop me now, no one
Ooh, it's hopeless
So hopeless to even try

The sun is shining, I feel good
And no one's gonna

[Intro]
I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living
With a broken heart

[Verse 1]
This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over
And I'm falling apart
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever
In each other's hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love


[Verse 2]
I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone

[Pre-Chorus]
How it hurts (Yeah) deep inside (Oh yeah)
When your love has cut
You down to size
Life is tough, on your own
Now I'm waiting for something
To fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love

[Chorus]
Yes, it's a hard life
True lovers together
To love and live forever
In each other's hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love


[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
(Yeah!) It's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching
For love in every way
It's a long hard fight (hard fight!)
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself
And say I did it for love

[Outro]
Yes, I did it for love
For love
Oh, oh, oh I did it for love

[Intro]
I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart

[Verse 1]
This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life

[Pre-Chorus]
You win, you lose
You just ah, da, da, da, ah, da, ba
Oh yeah, fell in love
But now you say it's over, I'm falling apart
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each other's heart
It's a long, hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love


[Verse 2]
I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
It's just a simple case of mind
But it happens to everyone

[Pre-Chorus]
How it hurts deep inside
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
Waiting for love

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's a hard life
True lovers together
To love and live forever in each other's heart
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way
It's a long hard fight
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

[Chorus]
(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
(Too late) Even now
The feeling seems to steal away
(So late) Though I'm crying
I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Verse 2]
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

[Chorus]
(It's late) But it's driving me so mad
(It's late) Yes, I know
But don't try to tell me that it's
(Too late) Save our love
You can't turn out the lights
(So late) I've been wrong
But I'll learn to be right
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Bridge]
I've been so long, you've been so long
We've been so long trying to work it out
I ain't got long, you ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

[Guitar Solo]
Tell me
Try to work it out, yeah
Woo! Ooh
Too late, yeah
Too late, much too late
Ah!

[Verse 3]
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

[Chorus]
(It's late) Ooh, but it's time to set me free
(It's late) Ooh yes, I know
But there's no way it has to be
(Too late) So let the fire
Take our bodies this night
(So late) Let the waters
Take our guilt in the tide, now
It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late
It's late, it's late, it's late

[Outro]
Oh, it's all too late
Whoa, oh, it's too late
Come on!
I'm late, too late, oh yeah
Whoa!


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you
In the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame

Turning my mind away
Oh oh, how I could love you
But, I don't know the way
Oh, but you should love me
If I could let you stay

[Chorus]
(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?

[Intro: Queen]
I want it all (Hey, yeah), I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming
With no time for doubt
With the pain and anger
Can't see a way out

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
"It ain't much I'm asking"
I heard him say
"Got to find me a future
Move out of my way"

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
Listen, all you people, come gather 'round
I gotta get me a game plan
Gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People, do you hear me?
Just give me the sign

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
For the dreams of youth

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
(Give it all, I want it all)
I want it all, and I want it now (Hey)
I want it all, I want it all
(Yes, I want it all, hey)
I want it all, and I want it now

[Bridge: Brian May (and Freddie Mercury)]
I'm a man with a one-track mind
So much to do in one lifetime
(People, do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise
And where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all (Yes, I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all
(And I'm giving it all, ooh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I want it all)

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
Hear the cry of youth
(Hear the cry, hear the cry of youth)

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
(Hey, yeah, yeah)
I want it all, and I want it now
(Ooh, ooh) I want it now

[Outro: Freddie Mercury]
I want it, I want it!
Oooh, huh!


[Armageddon]
You can't stop it, you can't stop it, you can't stop it, the world is in my pocket
You can't stop it, you can't stop it, you can't stop it, I want to profit
You got what I want and I need it right now, give it to me baby I don't care how

I hold my money with my left, got the world in my right pocket
Smoke a stoke in my right in between counting my profits
Poker face as I soak up the taste of display of women on my sofa
Doing the type of things I love so much
But so what, I'm sleazy it's not easy being Joe Smut
With more bucks than you can count, more than what's in your clutch
I could fund a small war and start a recession, the big dog, the boss hog
What I want is the question:

[Chorus: "I Want It All"]
I want it all, I want it all, I need it all right now, I want it all
I gotta get it, I got gots to get it, yo-
I want it all, I want it all, I need it all right now
I want it all, I want it all and I want it now

[Armageddon]
You got what I want and I need it right now, give it to me baby I don't care how
[Queen]
I want it all, I want it all. (x2)

If I don't get what I want then I'll take it in blood the queasy thug
Whose greed and lust just like cheap drugs that keep me buzzed
The heat and fuzz couldn't touch me I'm out of reach because
I'm eating lunch with a shady bunch, about to meet the judge
When people see me, they point and whisper "he's corrupt"
He couldn't care less, he's fearless, he'll give the reaper hugs
And as a kid he never took crap from no one
Mud on his face, such a disgrace, cussin at grown-ups


["We Will Rock You"]
Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on yo' face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place

[Chorus]
I want it all, I want it all, I need it all right now
I want it all, I gotta get it, I got gots to get it, yo-
I want it all, I want it all I need it all right now
I want it all, I want it all and I want it now

(Don't you know who I am?) I'm a big boss with big balls, everybody knows me
I'm a big deal, you should kneel, and crawl when you approach me
I got big bucks, big cars, I'm bigger than all the universe and its stars
I could buy your life whatever it costs
Name your price, give me what I need then get lost
I could buy the blue from the sky I'm a rich hog
Give me it now, I'm not the guy you want to piss off
By any means, I get what I want and I want it all

(Rock with me, guitar please. I’m egotistical. I’m a narcissist. I’m a big deal. Power and profit, yeah, power and profit.)

You got what I want and I need it right now, give it to me baby I don't care how
I got the world in my pocket and it's still not enough for me
I want it all and I want it right now, (x5)
And I want it right now


I want it all, I need it and I don't care how
I gotta get it, I got gots to get it now
I could feel it coming, it's any moment now
I want it all and I want it now
It's so intense I’m breaking, you can't hold me down
I gotta get it, I got gots to get it now
I could feel it coming, it's any moment now
I want it all and I want it now

You can’t stop it (I want it all) you can’t stop it
I want to profit, the world is in my pocket (right now)
You can’t stop it (I want it all) you can’t stop it
You can’t stop it, I want to profit

You can’t stop it (I want it all) you can’ stop it
I want to profit, the world is in my pocket (right now)
You can’t stop it (I want it all) you can’t stop it
You can't stop it (I want it all and I want it now), I want to profit

[Verse 1]

[Verse 1]
Oh, how wrong can you be?
Oh, to fall in love
Was my very first mistake
How was I to know
I was far too much in love to see?
Oh, jealousy, look at me now
Jealousy, you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy, you led me on
You couldn't lose, you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail

[Chorus]
How, how, how, oh my jealousy
I wasn't man enough
To let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

[Verse 2]
Oh, how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me
Oh, jealousy, you tripped me up
Jealousy, you brought me down
You bring me sorrow, you cause me pain
Jealousy, when will you let go?
Got a hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind

[Chorus]
How, how, how, oh my jealousy
I wasn't man enough
To let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

[Outro]
But now it matters not
If I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left
With my own jealousy


[Verse 1]
And then I saw Him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered 'round Him
The beggars shouted, the lepers called Him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about Him

[Chorus]
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see
The Lord Jesus (going down)
All going down

[Verse 2]
Then came a man before his feet he fell
Unclean, said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now, go now
You're a new man instead

[Chorus]
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see
The Lord Jesus (right)
All going down


[Verse 3]
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star, took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man

[Chorus]
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see
The Lord Jesus (going down to see him)
All going down

[Instrumental break 1:30-3:12]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star, took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man, that's right

[Outro]
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down



[Intro]
This is the only life for me (yeah)
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
Cause love is all you need
Love is all you need

[Verse 1]
Do you know what it is like
To be alone in this world
When you're down and out
On your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming
In the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing
Everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down
And you're flat on your back
A brand new day's beginning
Get that sunny feeling
And you're on your way

[Chorus]
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

[Verse 2]
Do you know how it feels
When you don't have a friend
Without a job and no money
To spend, you're a stranger
All you think about is suicide
One of these days
You're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger, yeah
That same old feeling
Just keeps burning deep inside
You keep telling yourself
It's gonna be the end
Oh, get yourself together
Things are looking better every day

[Chorus]
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the only life for me (yeah)
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just got to be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
Cause love is all you need

[Chorus]
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

[Guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
Cause love is all you need
Love is all you need
Baby, love is all you need

[Chorus]
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

[Outro]
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows




[Intro]
Taking off

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
"Be a superstar"
But I tell you, just be satisfied
And stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Yeah)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
Take you all your time and your money
Honey, you'll survive

[Verse 2]
Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
Take you all your time and your money

Hey, yeah, yeah

Keep yourself alive!

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you to be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

[Guitar Solo]
Yeah
Hit me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well I’ve loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive




[Intro]
Yeah

Yeah! Ayy, yeah

Still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

[Verse 2]
Sold a million mirrors in a shop in alleyway
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, "Be a superstar"
Tell you, just be satisfied, stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive

That's right

Give me everything I need, feed my body and my soul
Grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal

Told a million times of all the people in my way
How I'd have to keep on trying and get better every day

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive

[Verse]
Who said my party was all over
Huh, huh, I'm in pretty good shape
The best years of my life
Are like a supernova
Huh, huh, perpetual craze, I said that
Everybody drank my wine
You get my drift
And then we took a holiday
On Khashoggi's Ship, well
We really had a good, good time
They was all so sexy
We was bad, we was blitzed
All in all it was a pretty good trip

[Hook]
This big bad sucker
With a fist as big as your head
Wanted to get me, I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey
He pulled out a gun
Wanted to arrest me
I said uh, uh, babe
Now listen no-one stops my party
No-one stops my party
No-one, no-one, no-one stops my party
Just like I said
We were phased, we was pissed
Just having a total eclipse


[Bridge]
Bup bup, badabup, badibup bup bup
Bedabup bedadee hey

Oooh

Don't get started 'till midnight

[Outro]
Hey! Hah!

Party to the right

Alright, hey
Left, right, left, right
No one stops my, Aaahh!

[Verse 1]
Don't touch me now, don't hold me now
Don't break the spell darling, now you are near
Look in my eyes and speak to me
The special promises I want to hear

[Chorus]
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Love me slow and gently

[Verse 2]
One foolish world, so many souls
Senselessly hurled through the never-ending cold
And all for fear, and all for greed
Speak any tongue, but for God's sake we need

[Chorus]
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Let me know, this night and evermore

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
This room is bare, this night is cold
We're far apart and I'm growing old
But while we live, we'll meet again
So then, my love, we may whisper once more
It's you I adore

[Chorus]
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Touch me now

[Outro]
Las palabras de amor
Let us share the words of love
Forevermore
Forevermore


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I go off to work on Monday morning
Tuesday, I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday, I go waltzing to the Zoo

[Bridge]
I come from London town
I'm just an ordinary guy
Fridays, I go painting in the Louvre

[Verse 2]
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night (There he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday, lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon

[Outro]



[Verse 1]
I take a step outside and I breathe the air
And I slam the door and I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame
I won't call you names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games

[Verse 2]
I'm all through with ties
I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man, don't it look that way?
Shaking dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way
Back home (no way back home)
Oh, but I have to say

[Chorus]
Leaving home ain’t easy
Oh, I never thought it would be easy
Leaving on your own
Oh, there's a million things
A-calling me back
Leaving home ain’t easy
On the one you're leaving home

[Bridge]
Stay my love
My love, please stay
Don't stray, my love
What's wrong, my love?
What's right, my love?

[Chorus]
Leaving home ain’t easy
My God, how could I think of leaving?
Leaving on your own
Still trying to persuade me that
Leaving home ain’t necessarily
The only way

[Outro]
Leaving home ain’t easy
But may be the only way

[Verse 1]
When people talk of love
I'll lead the conversation
I'll say I feel just fine
Happy with my situation
But when I look away
People know my mind is straying
To where I once belonged
Dreaming about your heart again, yeah

[Chorus 1]
(Your heart again) yeah
Your heart again
Let me in your heart again
Listen to me honey

[Verse 2]
We like to face the blues
I give you satisfaction
(It's your heart again)
Despair was on your mind
I gave you the right direction
(It's your heart again)
So don't you walk away
Remember it's my heart you're breaking
You forget we were in love
Now my heart is only filled with pain


[Chorus 2]
Your heart again (oh)
Your heart again (heart again)
Let me in your heart again

[Bridge]
Oh, my love
I want you to stay
Don't leave me now
Or I just fade away
Oh, my love, don't hurt me this way

[Guitar Solo]
Oh, forgive me, babe
Do not ever tell me goodbye
Tell me yes
Oh
Don't let me wait too long
Or I'll lose my mind

[Verse 3]
When people talk of love
I have no hesitation
(It's your heart again)
Tell me what you're dreaming of
I'll hold that conversation for you, babe
(It's your heart again)
But when I look away, uh
People know my mind is straying, baby
To where I once belonged
Just let me in your heart again (heart again)


[Chorus 3]
Your heart again (heart again)
Oh, let me in your heart again (your heart again)

[Outro]
Open the doors for me, babe
To your heart again
Let me in

Take a peace of my heart
Ooh ooh, take a piece of my soul
(Ooh, ooh) Let me live
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my heart?
Why don't you take it
And break it and tear it all apart?
All I do is give, all you do is take
Baby, why don't you
Give me a brand new start?

[Chorus]
So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Let me live, oh baby
And make a brand new start

[Verse 2]
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my soul?
Why don't you shape it
And shake it 'til you're really in control?
All you do is take, all I do is give
All that I'm askin' is a chance to live

[Chorus]
(So let me live) so let me live
(Leave me alone) let me live, let me live
Why don't you let me
Make a brand new start

[Verse 3]
And it's a (long hard struggle)
But you can always depend on me
And if you're (ever in trouble) hey!
You know where I will be

[Verse 4]
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my life?
Why don't you twist it
And turn it and cut it like a knife?
All you do is live, all I do is die
Why can't we just
Be friends, stop livin' a lie?

[Chorus]
So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Please let me live
(Why don't you live a little)
Oh yeah baby
(Why don't you give a little love?)

[Guitar solo]

(Go for it, baby)

[Verse 5]
Let me live
Please let me live
Oh yeah baby, let me live
And make a brand new start

[Verse 6]
In your heart, oh baby
(Take another piece)
(Take another piece
Take another piece)
Please let me live
(Take another piece)
(Take another piece
Take another piece)
Oh, why don't you
Take another piece
(Take another piece of my heart)

[Outro]
Oh yeah baby
Make a brand new start
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Baby, Baby
All you do is take
(Let me live) Ooh ooh, let me live
(Oh yeah, yeah) Let me live

[Verse 1]
Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past

[Chorus]
Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real

[Verse 2]
Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream is just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel

[Chorus]
Life is real, life is real
Life is real, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it
I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breastfeeding myself
What more can I say
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it

[Chorus]
Life is real, life is real
Life is real

[Verse 3]
Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in every pore

Life is a bitch
Life is real, so real
Life is real, life is real
Yeah, life is real

Baby, you've been had

[Verse 1]
I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no?
Neptune of the seas, (seas)
Have answer for me, please (please)
The lily of the valley
(Valley) doesn't know

[Bridge]
I lie in wait with open eyes (oo-ooh)
I carry on through
Stormy skies (oo-oo-oo-ooh)
I follow every course
(Follow every course)
My kingdom for a horse
(Kingdom for a horse)
But each time I grow old (oo-oo-oo-wah)
Serpent of the Nile, (Nile)
Relieve me for a while (while)
And cast me from your spell
And let me go (oo-oo-ooh, let me go)

[Verse 2]
Messenger from Seven Seas
Has flown (ooh, oo-oo-ooh)
To tell the King of Rhye
He's lost his throne (Aah)
Wars will never cease (cease)
Is there time enough for peace? (peace)
But the lily of the valley
(Valley) doesn't know


[Outro]



[Verse 1]
You might believe in heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today

[Pre-Chorus]
Wake up in the morning
With a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way

[Chorus]
Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when
Now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

[Verse 2]
Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live, I could not live this way

[Chorus]
Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long, long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane

[Outro]
Such a long long way
Such a long long way
Such a long, long away
I'm looking for, looking for that day




[Instrumental Interlude]

[Vocal Ad-libs: Freddie Mercury]

[Verse 1]
With the morning I face the sun
I lift my head and smile for everyone
Every afternoon you'll find me working on
I got my new shoes on
Got to be moving on
(That's what they say)
Every night I'm tossed
And I shake my fevered brow
Thinking of my lost opportunity
Yes every morning I face the sun
I get so positive with everyone
And every afternoon
You'll find the cracks showing through
They know what I'm going through
(Oh yes they do)
Every evening finds me
The optimist behind me
Gone with my lost opportunity

[Intro]
Machines, machines
Machines, machines
Machines machines
Machines, machines

[Verse 1]
It's a machine's world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for rock 'n' roll
They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man

[Chorus]
They freeze me, they burn me
They squeeze me, they stress me
With smoke-blackened pistons
Of steel they compress me
But no one, but no one
But no one can wrest me away
Back to Humans

[Bridge]
We have no disease
No troubles of mind
We are fighting for peace
No regard for the time
We never cry, we never retreat
We have no conception
Of love or defeat


[Verse 2]
What's that machine noise?
It's bytes and mega chips for tea
It's that Machine, boys
With random access memory
Never worry, never mind
Not for money, not for gold, yeah

[Chorus]
It's software, its hardware
Its heartbeat, is time-share
It's midwife's, a disk drive
It's sex-life is quantized
It's self-perpetuating
A parahumanoidarianised
Back to Humans
Back to Humans

[Post-Chorus]
Back to Machines
Machines, machines
Machines, machines

[Outro]
Living in a new world
Thinking in the past (humans)
Living in a new world
How you gonna last? (humans)
Machine world
It's a Machine's world
Back to Humans

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm taking my ride with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart

[Chorus]
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what they say
Can't you see?
That's what everybody says to me
Can't you see?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh I know, I know, I know that it's true
Yes, it's really meant to be
Deep in my heart

[Verse 2]
I'm having to learn to pay the price
They're turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Don't see too many around

[Chorus]
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It's for all to see
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Everybody says to me
It was really meant to be
Oh, can't you see?
Yeah, everybody, everybody says
Yes, it was meant to be

[Post-Chorus]
When stormy weather comes around
It was made in heaven
When sunny skies break
Through behind the clouds
I wish it could last forever, yeah
Wish it could last forever, forever

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Made in heaven
I'm playing my role in history
Looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery
But giving in all my soul

[Chorus]
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Wait and see, it was really meant to be
So plain to see
Yeah, everybody, everybody
Everybody tells me so
Yes, it was plain to see
Yes, it was meant to be

[Outro]
Written in the stars

[Verse 1]
Been here before a long time ago
But this time I wear no sandals
Ages past I gave all you people
Food and water

[Verse 2]
Three feet tall, so very small I'm no trouble
I bring thunder, lightning, sun and the rain
For all the people in the land

[Verse 3]
A message of love
I bring you from up above
All good children gather around
Come join your hands and sing along

[Chorus]
They call me mad the swine
I guess I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you, save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord

[Verse 4]
I'll walk upon the water, just as before
I'll help the meek and the mild, and the lepers and the blind
And all the creatures great and small

[Bridge]
Let me take you to the river without a fall
Oh, and then one day you realize
You're all the same within his eyes
That's all I've got to say, just like before

[Chorus]
They call me mad the swine
I guess I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you, save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord

So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Hands and praise the Lord
Praise the Lord

[Outro]
Get down on my knees and praise the Lord




[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm gonna take a little
Walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action
Go crazy, driving in the fast lane
My baby left me alone
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
So come home, come home
If you don't you're gonna
Break my heart

[Chorus]
Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I am on the loose and I am
Looking for trouble
So look out, look out
I'm a man on the prowl

[Verse 2]
I don't want to be a rock and roll steady
I just want to be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
All I wanna do is sit on my ass
So honey, come home
Don't leave me when I am
Feeling so lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
Come home, come home
If you don't you are going
To break my heart

[Chorus]
Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm
Looking for trouble
So look out, look out
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl

[Bridge]
Well, I keep dreaming about my baby
But it ain't gonna get me nowhere
I gotta teach my baby dancing
But I am not Fred Astaire

[Outro]
So baby look out
I am a man on the prowl
Look out
Man on the prowl, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby, baby look out
Man on the prowl
Baby come home
I am on the loose and I'm
Looking for trouble
Baby come home, oh yeah
'Cause I am a man on the prowl
So honey come home, come home
'Cause I am a man on the prowl, yeah
Man on the prowl, yeah, hey
Steady there
Loosen up, whoo!

[Intro]
Don't you misfire
Fill me up with the desire
To carry on

[Verse 1]
Don't you know, honey
That love's a game?
It's always hit or miss
So take your aim
Got to hold on tight
Shoot me out of sight

[Chorus]
Don't you misfire, fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Don't you misfire, fill me up
With the desire to carry on

Your gun is loaded
And pointing my way
There's only one bullet
So don't delay
Got to time it right
Fire me through the night

Come on, take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If you’re feeling tired and lonely
Uninspired and lonely
If you’re thinking how
The days seem long
All you’re given
Is what you’ve been given
A thousand times before

[Chorus]
It's just more, more
More of that jazz
More, no more
Of that jazz
Gimme no more, no more
Of that jazz

[Verse 2]
Only football gives us thrills
Rock'n'roll just pays the bills
Only our team is the real team
Bring out the dogs
Get on your feet, lay on the floor
Can’t help thinking
I’ve heard that line before

[Chorus]
It's just more, more, more
Of that jazz
More, no more
Of that jazz
Gimme no more, no more
Of that jazz

[Bridge]
Oh, no matter
Fool got no business
Hanging 'round and tellin' lies
Bicycle races are coming your way
If you can’t beat ‘em join them
Fun it
Oh, you’re gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls you make
The rocking world go round

[Outro]
No more, no more, no more (oh)
Of that jazz




[Intro]

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life
Is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman
Gives me sweet mother love ah ha

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world
And they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy
And my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity
Just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me
All the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're going to give me all your sweet
Mother love ah ha (mother love)

[Verse 3: Brian May]
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet
Mother love

[Outro]
(Mother love, mother love
Love, love, love, love)
God works in mysterious ways
Eeeeh dop, de dop, dep dop
I think I'm going back to the things
I learned so well in my youth

She understands me
Understands me right

[Bridge]
My baby cares, she really cares
She knows what's really right for me
Does me good then she hurts me so
She winds me up then lets me go
Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby cuffs me
One day she tells me
That she cares
Another day she tells me
She don't love me


[Outro]
She really, really does me, ooh
Now people do you believe this?
Do you? Ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Uh, she really, really
Really, really, really, really
Ah, does me, hey

[Intro]
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever (Ooh, yeah)
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows through the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on, on, on, on
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...)

[Verse 2]
My fairy king (He rules the air and turns the tides)
He rules the air and can see things that are not there
For you and me to see (Ooh, yeah)
My fairy king (He guides the winds)
He can do right and nothing wrong

[Verse 3]
(Ah) Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land
(Ooh, ooh)


[Verse 4]
They turn milk into sour, like the blue in the blood of my veins
(Why can't you see it?)
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
(Son of heaven set me free and let me go)
Sea turns dry, no salt from sand
And seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor men's eyes (No more)

[Bridge]
Someone, someone
Has drained the color from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Oh, Mother Mercury (Mercury)
Look what they've done to me (Yeah)
I cannot run, I cannot hide

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 2]
My fairy king

And can see things that are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah (Too soon)
My fairy king

He can do right and nothing wrong

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 1]
This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Here we go, telling lies
Here we go (here we go)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
We're right back
Where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray, hey
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page, oh
Oh Lord, I thank you for my
My life has been saved


[Outro]
My life, my life has been saved
My life, my life
My life has been saved

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Another party's over
And I'm left cold sober
My baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated
With that special brew

[Bridge]
So come and get me, let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart
Is on an all time low
So don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in
For a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading
For that stormy weather soon

[Chorus]
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood
So now move over
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues


[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used
To my new exposure
So come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues



[Verse 1]
Another party's over
And I’m left cold sober
My baby left me for somebody new
I don't want to talk about it

Oooh-ooh, oooh-ooh

[Intro]
Yeah!
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
No, I'll never look back in anger
No, I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much

[Chorus]
I said I'd never
Nver be angry with you

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna feel like a stranger, no
'Cause I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines

[Chorus]
I said I'd never
Never be angry with you

[Bridge]
I must be strong so she won't know
How much I miss her
I only hope as time
Goes on, I'll forget her
My body's aching, can't sleep at night
I'm too exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cause I love
Love, love, love her


[Verse 3]
Come on baby, let's get together
I'll love you, baby, I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard, to stay away
What made you change, what did I say?

[Refrain]
Ooh, I need your loving tonight
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving, baby, tonight
(Hit me)

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Ooh, I need your loving tonight

[Verse 4]
No, I'll never, look back in anger
No, I'll never, find me an answer
Gave me no warning, how could I guess
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget

[Refrain]
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving tonight

[Verse 1]
There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry
And the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore (Ahh)
Can't you see?
Listen to the breeze
Whisper to me, please
Don't send me to the path
Of nevermore

[Verse 2]
Even the valleys is below
Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow (Ahh)
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me?
(Nevermore, nevermore)
Why did you deceive me?
(Nevermore, nevermore)
Send me to the path
Of nevermore (Ahh)
When you say you didn't love me
Anymore (Aahh)
(Ahh)

[Outro]
Nevermore
Nevermore


[Verse 1]
There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please don’t you cry anymore (Ahh)
Can't you see?
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me, please

[Chorus]
Don't send me to the path of nevermore

[Verse 2]
Even the valleys below
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender
Now haven’t anything to grow (Ahh)
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me? (Nevermore, nevermore)
Why did you deceive me? (Nevermore, nevermore)

[Chorus]
You send me to the path of nevermore (Ahh)
When you say you didn't love me anymore (A-a-a-a-a-a-ahh)
(Ahh)

Nevermore

If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Is this the real life, or 8-bit fantasy?
These classic games are my escape from reality
Blow on the cart', insert and press start with me

I love Nintendo, it is no mystery
Because it's Mega Man, Mario
Little Mac and Nemo
When I play Nintendo, it's so very special to me
To me

Mama, just lost again
It was nice, but then I died
And I can't find the strategy guide
Mama, the game had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown the fun away!

Mama, ooh
I think I made the princess cry
When I come home right after school tomorrow
I'll game on till the dawn, because Sega doesn't matter
Too late, my lives are gone
Nintendo Power's got no tips
And that game counselor's a dick (Stop playing games)
I bought new controllers, but nothing helps
And slow-mo makes the pain just hurt much more


Mama, ooh-ooh
When we play Nintendo
I want to beat this game!
I'd use a Game Genie, but that's so freakin' lame!

I see a little guy is he an extra man?
Silly douche! Silly douche!
You'll get no extra man, no!
Crazy difficulty, feels like you're insulting me!
Old Nintendo! (Old Nintendo!)
Used to beat it! (We were ten though!)
Games were harder then, you know!
Oh is that so?! (oh-oh-oh-oh)

I'm a decent gamer, why is this not easy?
You're just a loser and you suck verily!
Can't beat a game from back when you were three!

Is there no easy mode? Or a secret code?
Bad gamer, no! You'll get no cheating code!
Eat a toad!
Lame gamer! There is no easy mode!
What a load!
Bad gamer! There is no easy mode!

Easy mode!
There's no secret code!
Secret code!
Never, never, never there's no code
Oh, what's the code oh oh oh!
No, no, easy modes or codes!
Oh, mamma mia! Mamma mia!
Ask your mama for a code!
Miyamoto, will you ever make it easy for me?
For me?
For me?


So you think you can punch me and blacken my eye?
So you think that your demon will leave me to die?!
No, Wily! Can't do this to me, Wily!
Just gotta play on!
Just gotta play on without fear!

Ooh, yeah!
Ooh, yeah!

8-bit games aren't easy, anyone can see
Time to play the next one, prove I'm a real gamer to me

When we play Nintendo

[Verse 1: Brian May]
A hand above the water
An angel reachin' for the sky
Is it raining in Heaven?
Do you want us to cry?
And everywhere the brokenhearted
On every lonely avenue
No-one could reach them
No-one but you

[Chorus: Brian May]
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you...

[Verse 2: Roger Taylor]
Another tricky situation
I get to drownin' in the blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well, what would you do?
Yes, it was such an operation
Forever payin' every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through


[Chorus: Roger Taylor]
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
We'll remember
Forever...

[Verse 3: Brian May]
And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leavin'
Was in the way it was planned
And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye...

[Chorus]
And it's one by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun

[Outro: Brian May & Roger Taylor]
Cryin' for nothin'
Cryin' for no-one
No-one but you

.....(Queen)
You ain’t got to worry about none
Just look to the better day and smile
Cause you’ve come from way back
You deserve a shot, hustle always pays off

So no problems, No worries
You know I got you
Ain’t nobody to compare
No body deserves to
Bonny and clide
We up to no good
As long as it’s me and you


Hook... (Queen)
Ain’t fyna have no problem
(No... no... no... no... no...)
Ain’t fyna have no problem
(No... no... no... no... no...)




1st verse (Ivan Critic)


Yeah...
I’m alive when I look inside
Ain’t no problem
Stacking all my notes till this war is over
Check out my vibe when the party is over
Sitting on my couch busy sipping soda (damn)
Man ain’t it over, I got my soldier
Just like bonny and clide man we taking over
They thought it’s over, they didn’t know we starting over
We got our minds locked on grind man this shiii ain’t over

No circumstances
I live and I learn, it’s education
The price is patience
Check how I’m chilled, ain’t no competition
I’m on a mission
All I got to do is follow my vision
I got ambition
Blue prints on my notifications

Check all the weight of my hustle
I carry it all on my shoulders
Man I’d be riding with shorty now
She became part of my hustle
Take a nigga for a ride
Make it move don’t be shy
Wall paper motivation
While I’m starring on my ceiling





Hook (Queen)

Ain’t fyna have no problem
(No... no... no... no... no...)
Ain’t fyna have no problem
(No... no... no... no... no...)




2nd (Ivan Critic)

I failed in life more than a couple times
Breaking almost everything I touch
I reminisce, I consult my past, it’s deep...

I prayed to God when I wake up
All the worst is getting better
Slowly but surely but ain’t enough but still...

Living good life check my life
All these niggas wanna push chats
Speeding like a rollercoaster, I’m just me


Man I got not problems...
(ain’t fyna have no problem)
No problems

Spread your paper let my ink drip
Take a sit man enjoy this trip
I bump into couple of Pharisees
All they wanna do is to Question me

I know you heard a lot about me
Rumors are trending about me
You probably been talking about
Your mama be talking about me

Cut the chase man cut the act
Have some reference when you stating facts
It’s Ivan this man it’s Ivan that
I’ve been winning since my date of birth
Looking poorly the outside
Man I’ve been rich in my inside
I go dreams in my inside
Man I Cary the heavens in my inside




Hook (Queen)
Ain’t fyna have no problem
(No... no... no... no... no...)
Ain’t fyna have no problem
(No... no... no... no... no...)

Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

And many a tear lives on in my eye

And if the black crow flies
To find a new destination
That is the sign

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

[Verse 2]
He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies
The palm of a hand the incredible size
One great big eye
Has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah


[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

[Bridge]
The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh, keep a lookout!"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south

And the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more

No wrong, no right
I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white
No blood, no stain
All we need is one worldwide vision

[Chorus]
One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision
Whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh
Whoa-yeah, whoa-yeah, whoa-yeah!

[Bridge]
I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
(But a cold wind blows)
(And a dark rain falls)
And in my heart, it shows
Look what they've done to my dream

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
One vision!
Give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready!
There's only one direction
One world and one nation
Yeah, one vision

[Chorus]
No hate, no fight, just excitation
All through the night, it's a celebration
Whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-whoa-oh-oh yeah

[Drum Break]
Hey!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision

[Outro]
Give me one night (One night!)
Give me one day (One day!)
Just give me, ah
One man (One man)
One night (One night)
One day, hey, hey
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Fried chicken!
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


[Chorus]
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star
Right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you, yeah

[Verse]
My heart cries out to your heart
I'm lonely but you can save me
My hand reaches out for your hand
I'm cold but you light the fire in me
My lips search for your lips
I'm hungry for your touch
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment your surrender

[Saxophone Solo]

[Bridge]
And no one ever told me
That love would hurt so much
(Oooh yes it hurts)
And pain is so close to pleasure
And all I can do is surrender to your love
(Just surrender to your love)


[Chorus]
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star
Right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you
And all I can do is surrender

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Everybody knows
One day we're loving each other
Then we're fighting one another
All the time

[Verse 1]
When I was young
And just getting started
And people talked to me
They sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my 'magination
And all I wanted
Was to start a new relation
So in love, but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for
Some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed
Was some love and affection


[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong
And you turn out the light
But inside of your mind
You put up a fight

[Verse 2]
Where are the answers
That we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world
To be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good
Some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy
Someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love
Wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse
So let's make the best
Of the rest of our years


[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life

[Outro]
All your life, ooh
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure



[Intro]
We had a good night jamming away
There was a full moon showing
And we started to play
But in the cold light of day next morning
The party was over, uh uh
The party was over
We got love and we got style
And we got sex and I know
I know we got what it takes
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa!
Why don't you come back and play?

Come back and play (hey hey)

[Bridge]
Give it give it
We had a food fight in somebody's face
We were up all night singing (singing)
And giving a chase
But in the cold light of day next morning
Everybody was hung over

Hey, come back and play
(Come back and play)
Come back and play

With my sword and head held high
Got to pass the test first time, yeah

I hear it every day
But I can prove them wrong
Cause I'm right first time

[Verse 1]
They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand, boy
He disappointed me
So I got my handgun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
I had to make him pay

[Pre-Chorus]
You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out, baby, it's the season
For the mad masquerade

[Chorus]
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Oh, you need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Don't believe what your granddaddy said


[Verse 2]
She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution
Is right on my side
'Cause I caught my lover
In my neighbor's bed
I got retribution
Filled 'em all full of lead

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame

[Chorus]
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
You need a weapon like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Put out the fire, baby
Put out the fire
And let your sons and your daughters sleep sound in their beds


[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns

[Chorus]
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
You need a gun like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

[Verse 2]
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious
Honey

[Chorus]
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life
A little rain must fall

[Post-Chorus]
No problem, uh
Be cool, now

Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price
Honey

You found success and recognition
But into every life
A little rain must fall

Others seem to think
You are over dramatizing
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions, honey

[Chorus]
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cause into every life
A little rain must fall


[Post-Chorus]
Be cool, get this
Woo! Alright

[Outro]
Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool, yeah
Yes, baby
Ooh, one more time
Uh-huh, I like it
Make it rain

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Like I'm reaching out for you

Ride the wild wind

[Intro]
You never know who’s watching
You never know who will care
When everything is over




[Verse 1]
As I walk along I wonder
What went wrong with our love
A love that was so strong
And as I still walk on I think of
The things we have done together
While our hearts were young

[Chorus]
I am a-walking in the rain
Tears are falling and I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me
To end this misery and I wonder
I wah, wah, wah, wah wonder
Why
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away
And I wonder when she will stay
My little runaway a-run, run, run, run, a-runaway

[Chorus]
I am a-walking in the rain
Tears are falling and I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me
To end this misery and I wonder
I wah, wah, wah, wah wonder
Why
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away
And I wonder when she will stay
My little runaway, a-run, run, run, run, a-runaway
Run run run run runaway
Run run run run runaway

I Fly like paper get fly like paper

Fucked Up incide????



[Verse 1]
Hey, little babe, you're changing
Babe, are you feeling sore?
Ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more

[Verse 2]
It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say?
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way?

[Chorus]
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you

[Verse 3]
Forgive me for what I told you
My heart makes a fool of me
Ooh, you know I'll never hold you
I know that you gotta be free, yeah

[Chorus]
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down
My friend, sail away sweet sister
Back to my arms again

[Bridge]
Hot child don't you know
You're young?
You've got your whole life
Ahead of you
Ooh aah, you can throw
It away too soon
Way too soon, yeah

[Chorus]
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
Gonna love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you




It's getting late have you seen my mates
Ma tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
Want to get a belly full of beer

My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handfull of grease in her hair

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train

Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright alright alright

Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out She's with me! "

A couple of the sound that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass


[Verse 1]
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Verse 2]
The slate will soon be clean
I’ll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted, all that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I am cold inside
I have no real intent


[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
Each night I cry
I still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die (Ow!)

[Outro]
Save me, save me, save me (Oh yeah)
Yeah, save me (Yeah)
Save me, ooh (Oh, save me)
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, ooh (Save me)
I'm naked and I'm far from home

Save me, save me, oh

This is from an album called The Game
It's called Save Me

[Verse 1]
It started off so well

Give it to me

[Intro]
The harder we play
The faster we fall
When we think that we know it all
We know nothing at all

[Verse 1]
The letter arrives
Like a bolt from the blue
So what is left of your lives
All your dreams lost to you

[Chorus]
Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me

{Verse 2}
It is hard not to cry
It is hard to believe
So much heartache and pain
So much reason to grieve
With the wonders of science
All the knowledge we have stored
Magic cocktails for lives
People just cannot afford

{Chorus}[x4]


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Scandal
Now you've left me
All the world's gonna know
Hey, scandal
They're gonna turn our lives
Into a freak show

[Bridge]
They'll see the heartache
They'll see the love break
They'll hear me pleading
We'll say for God sakes
Over and over and over again

[Verse 2]
Scandal
Now you've left me
There's no healing the wounds
Hey, scandal
And all the world
Can make us out to be fools

[Bridge]
Here come the bad news
Open the flood gates
They'll leave us bleeding
We say "you cheapskates!"
Over and over and over again


[Verse 3]
So let them know when they stare
It's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air
And tell me what do they care

[Bridge]
It's only a life to be
Twisted and broken
They'll see the heartache
They'll see our love break, yeah
They'll hear me pleading
I'll say for God sakes
Over and over and over
And over again, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
(Scandal) (Scandal)
(Scandal) (Scandal)
Yes, you're breaking my heart again
(Scandal) Yes, you're loving
On out again

[Bridge]
Today: the headlines
Tomorrow: hard times
And no-one ever really knows
The truth from the lies
And in the end, the story
Deeper must hide
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside


[Outro]
(Scandal) (Scandal)
(Scandal) (Scandal)



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Seaside, whenever you stroll along with me
I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile, I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could, but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle, highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous

[Verse 2]
I feel so romantic, can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (Ooh, I'd like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season
The Mediterranean
This time of year, it's so fashionable

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I feel like dancing in the rain
Can I have a volunteer?
(Just keep right on dancing)
What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification, as a matter of fact
So très charmant, my dear

[Verse 4]
Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea
Reminiscing every night
Meantime (And in the meantime, baby)
I ask you to be my valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial, start a sensational

[Outro]
Seaside rendezvous, so adorable
Seaside rendezvous, ooh-ooh
Seaside rendezvous, give us a kiss

Give out the good
Leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan

Yeah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Sister, I live and lie for you
Mister, do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever, ever, ever
Ahh!

[Hook: Queen]
I can't stand a pointless ass bitch (x3)
Why are worryin' bout me
They can't be like me so they throw shade (x3)
They can't be like me they don't get paid
That's why I can't stand a pointless ass bitch

[Verse 1: BeatKing]
Pointless ass bitches come with pointless ass drama
Bitch you get that from your pointless ass mama
In the club with your pointless ass partners
Y'all look like some pointless ass burglars
I put you on blast you ain't got no cash
Flexin' on Instagram talking bout you taking you ain't got no man
Always talking bout you wanna find some chicks
But the chicks saw you in the club last week and you ran
Everytime you see a bad bitch, you always try to find something wrong with here, but you bad built
I don't get that til that chick get stacks
Point two where shade throwin' chick at
And tell her

[Hook: Queen]

[Verse 2: BeatKing]
Pointless ass bitches always fuck with pointless ass niggas (losers)
And they keep y'all in your pointless ass feelings
You wanna go out with your pointless ass squad
But you ain't got no gas in your pointless ass car
[?] a freak in the bed and a thot in the streets
Like a don get the bread, keep that eye on delete
Her number out my phone, girl you can kiss this D but you're not kissin' me
Pointless ass bitches like to fuck for 40 dollars like Pimp C said
If you see a bitch throwin'shade
Put your finger on her head and tell her


[Hook: Queen]

[Verse 3: BeatKing]
Pointless ass bitches have pointless ass kids
And they grow up to do pointless ass shit
They make a lot of pointless ass grades
And they all uglies like your pointless ass face
Pointless ass bitches always on a nigga D
She said she wanna suck the dick before she marry
I don't give a fuck about a pointless ass bitch
She in the club cause it's free before eleven (broke)
Pull in the slab, now she wanna ride
Wanna get inside
But I do not wanna rehost to do the most
Swangers on the ghost, pointless ass hoes full approach
Cut the beat down Queen talk to these hoes

[Hook: Queen]



[Verse 1]
Well you're just seventeen
All you wanna do is disappear
You know what I mean
There's a lot of space between our ears
The way that you touch don't feel nothing
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Riding on the silver salmon
She can ride the burning sky, yeah



[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain’t nobody wants to know

[Chorus]
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

[Verse 2]
So 'round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I ever seen
Hey, sonny, won't you sign
Right along the dotted line?
What you sayin', are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?

[Chorus]
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home
Now, I'll tell you what happened

[Bridge]
They took me to a room without a table
They said "blow your trumpet into here"
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

[Verse 3]
I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people wanna listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

[Chorus]
And I was sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
Have to have some fun

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Now they tell me
That I ain’t so fashion-able
And that I owe the man
A million bucks a year
So I told 'em
Where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here, yeah
Back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

[Chorus]
I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry
And I sure do wanna go home

[Outro]
Yeah




[Intro]
I like to sit here in the sunshine
The trees in the fields are green sublime
Suspended in time
And do not it make you feel small?

[Verse 1]
I like to sit here by the fire's light
The trees in the fields lie bare to the night
The stars burn bright
And do not let it make you feel small?

[Chorus]
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime

[Verse 2]
I like to sit here in the Autumn time
The trees in the fields they rustle in the wind
The church bells gently chime
Gentle on your mind
Suspended in time
And do not it make you feel small?

[Bridge]
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime
Oh peace of mind

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find - peace sublime
Oh peace of mind




[Chorus]
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Hmm
And peace sublime

You can take all your clothes off if you like too, doesn't matter
[Under Pressure riff plays]
Fuck off!
Haha
This, let me tell you what we're doing here
This is the last show in the series
It sounds like a television game
We're having it filmed
If you forget about the cameras it's just you and us, right?

[Verse 1]
You never heard my song before
The music was too loud
But now I think you hear me well
For now, we both know how

[Chorus]
No star can light our way
In this cloud of dark and fear
But someday, one day

[Verse 2]
Funny how the pages turn
And hold us in between
A misty castle waits for you
And you shall be a queen
(You shall be a queen)

[Chorus]
Today the cloud it hangs
Over us and all is grey
But someday, one day

When I was you and you were me
And we were very young
Together took us nearly there
The rest may not be sung


[Chorus]
So still the cloud it hangs
Over us and we're alone
But someday, one day
We'll come home



[Verse 1]
Once I loved a butterfly
Do not wonder how, do not ask me why
But I believed what I would have been told
All things that glitter cannot be gold

[Chorus]
Ooooo ooo yeah
All things that glitter cannot be gold

[Verse 2]
Those jealous minds conspired to say
Just let that creature fly away
How can it be she has it all
Her pride is headed for a fall

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh Lord, what races we run
Seeking our place in the Sun
Reaching and doping we will find the right one
Now every day a new joy brings
My butterfly grew golden wings
It seems we find as we grow old
Some things that glitter may be gold

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
So let us mind what is there to see
Before our hearts become too cold
In spite of all that we have been told
Some things that glitter may be gold

{Chorus}
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold

[Outro]
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter
May be gold

I want you, ahh
Woman

[Verse 1]
Tried to be a son and daughter
Rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man
For having your fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised
To find the cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?

I want you
To be a woman, yeah

Tried to be a teacher

An equal people preacher

Pardon me I have to get away

If it's back from where you came?

To be a woman

It's a little message to all of you that have come here tonight, all it says is 'Keep Yourself Alive'. . . )

[Verse 1]
Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
"Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping
Up the Emerald Bar"

[Chorus]
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

[Bridge]
He spends his evenings
Alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself
He'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world
Nothing would make him stay


[Verse 2]
Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him
"Now listen, boy! You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition
You won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy
At the Emerald Bar?"

[Chorus]
So honey, spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

[Outro]
Come on, honey
Fly with me

[Audience Applause]



That's the way I am
Does everybody want to know
This is the way I lead my life - you know
Wheeling and dealing
And a little bit of stealing
You know that's the way I grew up
That's the only life I know
That's the way my mother taught me
There you go

Stealing
I gave you the key to my home
I left you alone in charge of my heart
Hey stealing
You got me wheeling and dealing
You play with my feelings
Right from the start

Can't afford to pay my rent
I had to use my common sense
To get some money I owe - oho
This guy said look in my head
Make some easy bread
Stealing is the only way that I know

Stealing yeah only way that I know
Yeah I like stealing baby stealing
I gave you both my heart and my home
Left you alone
Now you'll be stealing stealing stealing
All my heart
You're my baby's heart
Uh uh

Baby let 'em bleed

You're in charge of my heart
You are in charge of my heart
You are in charge
You are in charge

Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da

Yes you are in charge of my heart
I gave you the key
And turned on the bed
I gave you the key
Come on I said what have I got
What have I got

Yes
I, I got the key out of my heart
Now get that key out of my heart
You're in charge of my heart
Come on




[Verse 1]
I cannot wake in the morning
I cannot sleep at night
I got a pain in my memory
That just will not sit right
You might say I am losing my mind
What a shame, shame, shame
But I do not want and I do not need
To play the crying game
Music lights this flame in me
I will not let it go and it will not let me be
I am just a happy slave and oh I cannot leave it
Because I am still, and I always will - be a believer

[Chorus]
Still burning (yeah)
Still yearning (and the wheel's)
Still turning (ooh let me tell you why)
We are jiving (and the beat's)
Still driven (and we are all)
Sky diving (rock and roll never die)

[Verse 2]
I cannot breathe in the city
Got dust in my lungs
I get mad in the country
Everything seem to go wrong
You might think I am playing around
But my heart is true
I got reason to believe
That sweet soul magic
Going to tear my heart in two
Music makes the world go round
I have been flying on the wings of the sound
It feels so good from way up here
I am still a believer
Heading for the stars

[Chorus]
Oh yeah
Still burning, still yearning
Still burning
Still yearning
Still turning (better than every guy)
We are jiving
Still driving
Sky diving (rock and roll never die)

[Verse 3]
Do not say that you love me I cannot go that road
But do not think for a moment that my heart went cold
I keep thinking about what I lost
And what I might have found
I went to sleep and when I woke
Everything had turned around

[Chorus]
Still burning (yeah)
Still yearning
Still turning (a new day dawning)
We are jiving
Still driving
Sky diving (early in the morning)

[Chorus]
Still burning (yeah)
Still yearning (and the wheel's)
Still turning (better than every guy)
We are jiving (and the beat's)
Still driving (and we are all)
Sky diving (rock and roll never die)




[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Sleeping very soundly
On a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round
Gotta clear out of town
Yeah, I'm smelling like a dry fish bone

Gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, never, never get it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

If I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell?

[Intro]
Surf is up
School is out
I got a criminal urge to
Twist and shout

[Verse 1]
I have been searching
My whole life through
For some perfect dream
Imagined in my youth

[Chorus]
Follow that dream
Surf is up – School is out
Surf is up – School is out

[Verse 2]
For a perfect life
Find a perfect girl
You got to follow that dream
To a perfect world
I have been a searcher
An adventurer too
This ride still runs
I want to ride with you
This ride still runs
Want to ride with you


[Chorus]
Follow that dream
Surf is up – School is out
Surf is up – School is out

[Verse 3]
In the town and the country
We all lay and dreamed our dreams
Then we found the world is tough
And all is not quite what it seems
Got to take it by the horns
Got to seize your precious day
Got to follow your dream

[Outro]
Follow that dream
Follow that dream
Follow that dream
Surf is up – School is out
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf up - School's out
Follow that dream
Follow that dream

[Intro]
Ooh, I like it

[Verse 1]
You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
Ooh, you bring me down, you shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone
Ooh, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (Sweet lady)
Ooh, stay sweet

[Verse 2]
You call me up and feed me all the lines
You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese
Waiting on the shelf
You eat me up, you hold me down
I'm just a fool to make you a home
Ooh, you really do and you say

[Chorus]
Sweet lady (Sweet lady)
Sweet lady (Sweet lady)
Sweet lady (Ooh, come on)
Stay sweet

My sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever

[Audience cheering]



[Verse 1]
My new purple shoes
Been amazin' the people next door
And my rock 'n roll 45's
Been enragin' the folks on the lower floor
I've got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kind of ritual

[Chorus]
Ooh, give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

[Verse 2]
I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation, just cuts like a knife
When you're young, and you're poor, and you're crazy

[Chorus]
Ooh, give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place


[Verse 1]

And when we go down to Smokies and rock

[Verse 2]

But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation, just cuts like a knife
When you're young

(Young and you're crazy)
(Young and you're crazy)
(Young and you're crazy)
Young and you're crazy!


[Chorus]
Ooh, give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place



[Verse 1]
When I'm gone
No need to wonder
If I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us
And time is but a paper moon
Be not gone

[Verse 2]
Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold
The flower that touches you
A new life grows, the blossom knows
There's no one else
Could warm my heart as much as you
Be not gone

[English Chorus]
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned

[Japanese Chorus]
Teo Torriate konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki

[Verse 3]
Hear my song
Still, think of me the way
You've come to think of me
The nights grow long
But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes
And you can be with me
Dream on

[Japanese Chorus]
Teo Torriate konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki

[Bridge]
When I'm gone
They'll say we're all fools
And we don't understand
Oh, be strong
Don't turn your heart
We're all, you're all
For all, for always

[English Chorus]
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned

[Instrumental outro]


[Verse 1]
Oh, my love, we've had our share of tears
Oh, my friend, we've had our hopes and fears
Oh, my friends, it's been a long hard year

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas

[Verse 2]
The moon and stars seem awful cold and bright
Let's hope the snow will make this Christmas right
My friend, the world will share this special night

[Pre-Chorus]
Because it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one night

[Chorus]
Thank God it's Christmas, yeah
Thank God it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Can it be Christmas?
Let it be Christmas
Every day


[Verse 3]
Oh, my love, we live in troubled days
Oh, my friend, we have the strangest ways
All my friends on this one day of days
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one day

[Outro]
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Ooh yeah
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes, yes, yes, yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one day
A very merry Christmas to you all

[Intro]
He's a fairy feller

[Verse 1]
Ah, ah, the fairy folk have gathered
Round the new-moon shine
To see the feller crack a nut
At night's noon-time
To swing his axe he swears
As he climbs he dares
To deliver the master stroke

[Verse 2]
Ploughman, "Waggoner Will", and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
He's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
Dirty fellow, what a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and the junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
(Can we see the master stroke)
What a quaere fellow


[Bridge]
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

[Bridge]
Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader

[Verse 3]
Oberon and Titania
Watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen
And there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow

[Outro]
The ostler stares
With hands on his knees
Come on Mr. Feller
Crack it open if you please


[Transition into Nevermore]



Ahhh, ahhh, ahh
Ah-ah

Fairy folk have gathered 'round
The new moonshine
See the feller crack-a-nut
At night's noon-time
Axe he swears
'cause he climbs he dare
To deliver

Ploughman 'Waggoner Will' and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
Dally-oh
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
What a dirty lad-io

Tatterdemalion and a junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
Hero

Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend...
In yellow
What a quaere fellow...

(Instrumental bridge/piano-guitar solo)

Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader

And there's a good apothecary man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend

Come on Mr. Feller
Crack it open if you please
Ahhhh, ahh ...

Freddie:  Tell you what, it's time you all joined in, everybody, and I know you know the words to this one, all you gotta do is clap along, sing along the choruses, it's called ...)


[Verse]
So you feel like you ain't nobody?
Always needed to be somebody?
Put your feet on the ground
Put your hand on your heart
Lift your head to the stars
And the world's for your taking
(All you gotta do is save the world, yeah)

[Verse 2]
So you feel it's the end of the story?
Find it all pretty satisfactory?
Well I tell you, my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation

Stands for every one of us
He'll save with a mighty hand (he'll save with a mighty hand)

He saved with a mighty hand (save us)
Every man every woman every child (man, woman, child)

That's right!

[Chorus]
Hitman, now don't you cry

[Intro: Roger Taylor & Freddie Mercury]
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me

[Interlude 1: Roger Taylor]
Freddie Mercury!

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
When you hear a sound
That you just can't place
Feel something move
That you just can't trace
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread

[Chorus: Roger Taylor & Freddie Mercury]
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

[Interlude 2: Freddie Mercury]
John Deacon!

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
Now I'm in your room and I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life and I'm in your head
Like the CIA or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive

[Chorus: Roger Taylor & Freddie Mercury]
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
Hah, hah, hah, hello
Hah, hah, hah, okay
Hah, hah, hah, hello, hello, hello, hello
Never had a real good friend
Not a boy or a girl
No one knows what I've been through
Let my flag unfurl
So I make my mark
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

[Interlude 3: Freddie Mercury]
Brian May, Brian May!

[Verse 3: Freddie Mercury]
Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
But I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me, dear

[Chorus: Roger Taylor & Freddie Mercury]
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

[Interlude 4: Roger Taylor & Freddie Mercury]
Look at me, look at me
Rrrroger Taylor!

[Outro: Freddie Mercury]
Shake you, shake you, dear





[Verse 1]
Mama's gotta problem
She don't know what to say
Her little baby boy
Has just left home today

[Chorus]
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's Ma on whom you can always depend

[Verse 2]
She washed and fed
And clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is "goodbye Ma"
And the nighttime's for her tears

[Chorus]
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's Ma on whom you can always depend

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
So listen, mothers everywhere
To just one mother's son
You'll get forgotten on the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets, and just remember
It's not so long since you were young

[Outro]
You're bound to be the loser in the end
You're bound to be the loser in the end
They'll choose their new shoes
That's not far to bend
You're Ma on whom they can always depend




[Intro]
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Why don't you mean it
Why do I follow you
And where do you go

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
You've never seen nothing
Like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven
And then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
(And the world will so allow it)
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing
In a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys
Praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen
Poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that
Bring them down to size

[Chorus]
(March to the Black Queen)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Put them in the cellar
With the naughty boys
A little bit of sugar
Then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on every
Finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun
Make this, make that
Keep making all that noise

[Chorus]
(Oooh, march to the Black Queen)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby
You can be my honey-Chile, yes

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings
You are an angel
Remember to deliver
With the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul
Lies a man and very soon
He'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life
He'll bring a little love

[Verse 4]
I reign with my left hand
I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness
I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power, now do
The march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me
I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Ah ah ah ah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Walking true to style
She's vulgar, 'buse, and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes
And she never dots her "I's"

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone
La la la la forever, forever
Ah ah ah ah ah

[Segue to "Funny How Love Is"]




(Medley segue after 'Killer Queen' begins with piano and guitar intro to the fourth verse of the full song that is "The March of the Black Queen", which Queen never performed live in its entirety.)

I rule with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power!
I've got the power, now do the march of the Black Queen
(My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie)
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me (I want it)
Take a little love from me
I wanna share it with you
I feel like a millionaire

[Verse 2]
Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days
Holding hands together
Do you remember, my love?
How we danced and played
In the rain we laid
How we wish that we could stay there
Forever and ever

[Verse 3]
Now I am sad, you are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me
How I long for your love
Come back to me
Be happy like we used to be

[Guitar solo]

Come back, come back to me
Come back, come back to me
Oh come back to me, oh my love

My fine friend, take me with you
And love me forever
My fine friend, forever (forever)

Come back, come back to me
You make me feel like a millionaire




[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Every drop of rain that falls
In Sahara Desert says it all
It's a miracle
All God's creations great and small
The Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal
That's a miracle
Test tube babies being born
Mothers, fathers dead and gone
It's a miracle

[Chorus 1]
We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
The wonders of this world go on
The hanging Gardens of Babylon
Captain Cook and Cain and Abel
Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

[Bridge]
The one thing we're all waiting for
Is peace on earth, an end to war
It's a miracle we need, the miracle
The miracle we're all waiting for today

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
If every leaf on every tree
Could tell a story that would be
A miracle
If every child on every street
Had clothes to wear and food to eat
That's a miracle
If all God's people could be free
To live in perfect harmony
It's a miracle

[Chorus 2]
We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
(The wonders of this world go on)
Open hearts and surgery
Sunday mornings with a cup of tea
Super powers always fighting
Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

[Instrumental break]
(The wonders of this world go on)
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

[Bridge]
The one thing (the one thing)
We're all waiting for (we're all waiting for)
Is peace on earth (peace on earth)
And an end to war (an end to war)
It's a miracle we need - the miracle
The miracle, peace on earth
And end to war, today

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends


[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
When I was young it came to me
And I could see the sun breaking
Lucy was high and so was I
Dazzling, holding the world inside
Once I believed in everyone
Everyone and anyone can see

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh-oh, the night comes down
Ooh, and it's dark again

[Verse 2]
Once I could laugh with everyone
Once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively
Colouring, holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see
You gotta believe it

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh-oh, the night comes down
Oooh, and it's dark again


[Outro]
And it's dark again
And it's dark again



[Instrumental intro]

[Intro]
Oh, oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man

[Verse 1]
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves

[Pre-Chorus]
"I see no day," I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand
Oh, oh, children of the land
Quicken to the new life, take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove

[Verse 2]
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late, all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain

[Pre-Chorus]
The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all around will be your dowry

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
And two by two, my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain
Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you

[Acapella Canon]
Ah, people can you hear me?
And now I know and now I know
And now I know, I know
I know that you can hear me
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know
The earth will shake, in two will break
The earth will shake, in two will break
Death all around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
Now I know, now I know, now I know
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Listen to the wise, listen to the wise
Listen to the wise, listen to the wise
Listen to the wise man
La-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

Come here
I, you
Come here
I, you
Come here
I, you
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Listen to the man, listen to the man
Listen to the man, listen to the madman

[Instrumental break]

[Pre-Chorus]
God give you grace to purge this place
And peace all around may be your fortune

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, children of the land
Love is still the answer, take my hand
The vision fades, a voice I hear
"Listen to the madman"

[Outro]
Ooh, but still I fear and still I dare not
Laugh at the madman

[String Solo]




[Verse 1]

(FM):
There must be more to life than this
(MJ):
There must be more to life than this
(Together):
How do we cope
(FM):
In a world without love?
(MJ):
Mending all those broken hearts, attending to those crying faces
There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
(FM):
Ooh, I live in hope, for a world filled with joy
(MJ):
There must be more to life than this

[Verse 2]

(FM):
Why is this world so full of hate?
(MJ):
People dying everywhere
(FM):
And we destroy what we create
(MJ):
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go and say c'est la vie
(Together):
So this is life

[Verse 3]

(MJ):
There must be more to life than living
(FM):
There must be more to life than this
(MJ):
I live in hope, for a world filled with love
Then we can all just live in peace

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]

(MJ):
There must be more to life than this
(FM):
There must be more than meets the eye
I only hope, for a world filled with love
There must be more to life than this

[Outro]

(Together):
There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life
(FM):
More to life than this


[Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces
There must be more to life than this
There must be more than meets the eye
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People dying for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life?

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
A living hope for a world fill with love
And waking up, just making noise

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus: Both]
There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
A living hope for a world fill with love
There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days, long ago
When we were kids
When we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know
The days were endless
We were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shining
We just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show

[Chorus]
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone
Now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you

[Verse 2]
You can't turn back the clock
You can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time
On a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinking
On what you did
When you can lay back
And enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

[Chorus]
'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone
Now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone
Now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find I still love you

[Outro]
I still love you


Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days - long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know?
The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shining, we just live for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don*t know
The rest of my life's been just a show

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find, I still love you

You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame? (ain't that a shame?)
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are gone but now some things remain
When I look and I find no change


Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find, I still love you

I still love you
Still love you

Tell me something that will ease my pain
I am living life in vain
Crying does not help me any more
Tell me something that will ease my mind
I am walking the line
Trying does not get my anywhere

[Chorus]
I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night

[Verse 2]
Tell me something cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
I cannot face it and there is no place I can hide

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tell me something cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give

I've got a sweetheart in hand to put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on all night

[Chorus 2]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Send your little brother swimming with a brick, that's alright
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Your mommy and your daddy are gonna plague me till I die
They can't understand it, I'm just a peace loving guy

[Chorus 3]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Get that big big big big big big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down, yeah, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight


[Outro]
Give me every inch of your love
All your love tonight, yeah
All your love
Tonight



[Verse 1]
With the sun in your eyes and the wind in your face
To heaven you rise in a holy embrace
Your feet on the round your head in the clouds
And you are wondering if you are never coming down
In an instant the mysteries of life will unfold
The myths and the dragons of time will explode
Here is to a real understanding of truth
For compassion and grace to be given their chance too

[Chorus]
Raise up your mind
It is time to shine

[Verse 2]
A moment down through millennium
Unveiling the secrets of song to be sung
Waters of life flowing soft to the touch
Wisdom remembered have we forgotten oh so much

[Chorus]
Raise up your mind
It is time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it is time to shine

[Verse 3]
Let us awaken from barbarity
Into a world of serenity
Beyond the rage of foolish pride
And on to the golden shores of paradise

[Outro]
Raise up your mind
Hey, it is time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it is time to shine
Raise up your mind
Your time to shine
It is time to shine[x2]


[Verse 1]
I'm just the pieces
Of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears
Are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long

[Verse 2]
Oh, I feel like no one
Ever told the truth to me
About growing up
And what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

[Chorus]
Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'Cause you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time


[Verse 3]
I'm just the shadow
Of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's
No way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down

[Verse 4]
Ooh, how would it be
If you were standing in my shoes?
Can't you see that
It's impossible to choose?
No, there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
Oh, yes!

[Chorus]
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time


[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Yes, too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life
You'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you

[Outro]
In the end

Mmm num ba de

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for

Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two

Puts people on streets

Um ba ba be

Ee day da - that's okay

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'

Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Watching some good friends screaming

Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn

Why - why - why?

Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (people on streets) edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure

[Verse 1]
When the moons rises
The dogs will howl
Look out of your window
I will be on the prowl
I am not usually
A gambling man
But oh I just want to
Hold up my hands

[Chorus]
And say I am
Taking a chance on you love
Whoa I am taking a chance on you love

[Verse 2]
I am not superstitious
And I do not wear no charm
I do not carry my heart on the sleeve of my arm
Seven years of bad luck
Please do not worry me
Cause when I look in the mirror
Here is the future I see

[Chorus]
I am taking a chance on you love
Whoa, I am taking a chance on you love


[Verse 3]
Place your bets, Better yet
Do not forget, What I said
Roll the dice, Spin the wheel
Always remember, You have got to keep it real
Do not believe in voodoo
Black magic was never my style
But I believe you do
And it will not take much time
To gather the portions
That weave your magic spell
The moon on the ocean
Has a secret to tell

[Chorus]
But anyway I am
Taking a chance on you love
Whoa I am taking a chance on you love[x2]



[Instrumental]




[Verse 1]
They were born with the knowledge of the struggle to survive
They were raised, learning only ways to stay alive
Their language is the language of the bullet and the gun
If you can see them coming, baby better run

[Chorus]
Here come the war boys
Here come the war boys

[Verse 2]
Well they look so pretty as they march and drill
It is such, a pity that they are dressed to kill
Soldiers marching two by two
When it all comes down they know exactly what to do

[Chorus]
Here come the... war

[Verse 3]
War boys, war boys, children and their toys
War boys, war boys, make lot a noise
War boys, when the lightning explodes
I pray for your soul

[Bridge]
Hop...2...3...4

Well they look so fierce they are going to tear out your heart
When they get near we are going to see what they got
Hold on to your soul, friend of mine
I will see you in hell, some other time

[Outro]
Here come the boys
Helping to kill, those who deserve to die
Tell me who decides
You and I
We have the power


[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
What is there left for me
To do in this life?
Did I achieve what I had
Set in my sights?
Am I a happy man
Or is this sinking sand?
Was it all worth it
Was it all worth it?
Yeah, now hear my story
Let me tell you about it

[Pre-Chorus]
We bought a drum kit
I blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit
Thought we were perfect

[Chorus]
Was it all worth it?
Ooh, giving all my heart and soul
And staying up all night
Was it all worth it?
Living breathing rock 'n' roll
A godforsaken life
Was it all worth it
Was it all worth it all these years?


[Verse 2]
Put down our money
Without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won
If we lost
Yes, we were vicious
Yes, we could kill
Yes, we were hungry
Yes, we were brill

[Pre-Chorus]
We served a purpose
Like a bloody circus
We were so dandy
We love you madly

[Chorus]
Was it all worth it?
Living breathing rock 'n' roll
This godforsaken life
Was it all worth it
Was it all worth it?
When the hurly burly's done

[Guitar Solo]
[Synth Orchestra Interlude]


[Pre-Chorus]
We went to Bali
Saw God and Dali
So mystic, surrealistic

[Chorus]
Was it all worth it? Yeah, yeah!
Giving all my heart and soul
And staying up all night
Was it all worth it?
Ooh, living breathing rock 'n' roll
This never ending fight
Was it all worth it
Was it all worth it?

[Outro]
Yes, it was a worthwhile
Experience, ha-ha!
It was worth it!

We are the champions
We are the champions
[Ooh]
We are the champions

[Outro]
[Freddie Mercury]
That was a lovely feel, (it was)
That's exactly how it should be

[Verse 1]
I believe there is no evil out there we did not have a hand in
You believe it is a time for peace and a time for understanding
Some of us believe that we are chosen
And if God is on our side we will win the game
And some of us believe that there is a heaven
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name
But let us get it straight

I believe there is just once chance in this world to hear our brothers
You believe there is a better way to listen to each other
We do not get what the other guy is saying
We hear the words but we do not understand
So around the world the same old anger raging
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down

[Chorus]
We believe there is a better way to fight
There is a way to make our children safe at night
We believe there is a war we could be winning
But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive

[Verse 2]
I believe we need a hero to step boldly from the shadows
You believe there must be someone on the scene that fits the bill
A man or a woman who knows how to say I am sorry
With courage in his heart to match his creed
A leader who can build a brand new morning
And match the tide of changes
Match the intent with the deed


[Chorus]
We believe there is a deed of obligation
To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation - in our time
We believe there is not a minute we should be wasting
When the darkness falls it is too late to fix the crime
It is peace that we need

[Verse 3]
Every father every mother knows the meaning
Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get

[Chorus]
We believe there is a song that is worth the singing
It is a song of truth we are bringing
There is a way to share the Earth with everyone
We believe every creature has a being
Has a right to respect and feeling
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun
That's what we believe

[Verse 1]
We causin' all the devastation when we step into the place
And better believe that you can sing, we're gonna rock and never stop
And here we go again, hit you with the flow again
Pick it up, the second time around, we bring it on again, shout it out

[Verse 2]
Buddy you're a boy, makin' big noise playin' in the street
Gonna be a big man some day

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm a simple man
With a simple name
From this soil, my people came
In this soil remain
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
And we made us our shoes
And we trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
White man, white man
Don't you see the light
Behind your blackened skies
White man, white man
You took away sight
To blind my simple eyes
White man, white man
Where you gonna hide
From the hell you've made?


[Verse 3]
Oh, the red man knows war
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies
Oh yeah

[Verse 4]
Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by every God's name
Say your prayers for your race

[Chorus]
White man, white man
Our country was green
And all our rivers wide
White man, white man
You came with a gun
And soon our children died
White man, white man
Don't you give a light
For the blood you've shed?

[Instrumental break]


[Chorus]
White man, white man (oh)
White man, white man
White man (ooh, white man)
Fought your battle with lies
White man
White man (on and on, on and on)
But we weren't too civilized, yeah
White man, white man (look around you)
Take a look around
Every skin and bone
(Yeah, I'll getcha, I'll getcha, yeah)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone
A man who learned how to teach
Then forgot how to learn
Oh yeah

[Intro]

So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

[Verse 1]

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known

[Chorus]

The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

[Bridge]

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see


[Verse 2]

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came

[Chorus 2]

White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

[Bridge]

My Goddess, hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait

No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends

He's called 'Great King Rat' ...)

So sad, her eyes

We've narrowly, narrowly escaped having a number one single this week, ah, and this is the side which you haven't been hearing on the Tony Blackburn show ...)




[Verse 1]
I make it half past six, you come at seven
Always try to keep me hanging round
You little spoilt thing
Girl, you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view

[Chorus]
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well, I don't need
Who needs you?

[Verse 2]
Oh, I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding
Lying flat on your face
Reaching out reaching out
For a helping hand
(Where is that helping hand?)

[Bridge]
Oh, muchachos
I like it, I like it
Well, I don't need you

[Verse 3]
How I was pushed around
Don't let it get you down
You walked all over me
But don't you ever give in
Taking one step forward
Slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling
That you can't forget
Reaching out for a helping hand

[Verse 4]
When I met you
You were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were, oh, so, so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say

[Chorus]
I had to swallow my pride
So naïve you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well, I don't need
Who needs you?

[Outro]




[Verse 1]
There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh

[Verse 2]
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh
Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?

[Instrumental outro]


[Verse 1: Adam Lambert]
There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?

[Chorus: Adam Lambert]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

[Verse 2: Helene Fischer]
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one
Sweet moment set aside for us

[Chorus: Helene Fischer & Adam Lambert]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever, who?
Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?

[Bridge: Helene Fischer & Adam Lambert]
So touch my tears with your lips
Touch my whole world with your fingertips, yeah
And we can have forеver

[Intro]
This song is dedicated to those who lost their lives last night in Orlando, Florida
And anybody that has been victim to any senseless violence or hatred

[Verse 1]
There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh

[Verse 2]
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh, yeah
Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?


[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
So touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?

Throw down your hat, kick off your shoes
I know you ain't goin' anywhere
Run 'round the town singin' your blues
I know you ain't goin' anywhere

You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always sayin' "Farewell"
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself...
Or is that what you're tryin' to do?
Put up a fight you believe to be right
And someday the sun will shine through

You've always got something to hide
Something you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

And I know what you're wishing for
Time in a peaceful world
Time in a peaceful world
Time in a peaceful world
Time in a peaceful world

You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always sayin' "Farewell"
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well




[Verse]
Yeah




[Chorus]
All these years we’ve been at war
These years of blood and gore
We can only pray we’ll win

And those who’ve gone to fight
May not last through the night
So we send our prayers unto the wind

Every day we hope there’s peace
We hope for sweet release
Hope that a new life begins

And when the day will dawn
We’ll pray for those who’ve gone
Singing out this song upon the wind

The sun soon will shine, on a bright new day
The wind will carry fears away
A bell soon may chime, it’s a matter of time
And daybreak will shine, bring the day

[CRONO]
Lost in these four hundred years
Marle cast away, I fear
I don’t know her where or when

But I’ll save history
I swear I will not be
Just another scene lost on the wind

[Chorus]
We’ve all stories to be told
Not of glory or gold
Stories only we’ll begin

In these stories we will hope
That we’ll be grand in scope
Heard within the yearnings of the wind

The sun soon will shine, on a bright new day
The wind will carry fears away
A bell soon may chime, it’s a matter of time
And daybreak will shine, bring the day

[CRONO & Chorus]
We’ve all stories to be told
Not of glory or gold
Stories of the yearnings of the wind




[Verse 1]
Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering, my heart's jittering
Just you and I
Not tonight, come tomorrow
When everything's sunny
And bright (sunny and bright)
No, no, no, come tomorrow
Cause then we'll be
Waiting for the moonlight

[Chorus]
We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight

[Verse 2]
Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay a while

[Bridge]
You know I never could
Foresee the future years
You know I never could see
Where life was leading me
But will we be together forever?
What will be my love?
Can't you see that I just don't know
Don't know

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
No, no, not tonight, come tomorrow
When everything's gonna
Be alright (sunny and bright)
Wait and see if tomorrow
Will be as happy
As we're feeling tonight

[Chorus]
We'll go walking
In the moonlight (Oh, we'll be happy)
Walking in the moonlight

[Verse 4]
I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
Just you and I
Ooh, just you and I

[Outro]
Mm, just you and I
Can't you see that
We gotta be together, be together
Just you and I, just you and I
No more questions, just you and I


[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

[Chorus 1]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions

[Chorus 2]
You are the champions, my friends
And you'll keep on fighting till the end
You are the champions
You  are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause you are the champions
Of the world, yeah-yeah, yeah

That sexy smile
You don't fool me, uh
You don't rule me, you're no surprise
You're telling lies
Hey, you don't fool me

Mama said "You know

Baby, you don't fool me, yeah

You don't have to say don't mind
You don't have to teach
Me things I know
Sooner or later

Oh (fool you), oh (rule you)
She'll take you (take you)
And break you (break you)

Mama said "Be cool"
Mama said "She'll take you for a fool"
She'll take you and break you

Ooh, you-ou-ou-ou
Take my breath away

[Verse 1]
Look into my eyes and you'll see
I'm the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart, changed my life
Every time you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside

[Chorus]
You take my breath away

[Verse 2]
You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
(Please don't cry anymore)
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life
For just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love


[Chorus]
You take my breath away

[Bridge]
So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you anywhere you go
I'll be right behind you (ooh)
Right until the ends of the earth (aah)
I'll get no sleep
Till I find you (get no sleep)
And tell you that you just

[Chorus]
Take my breath away

[Instrumental Break]

I will find you anywhere you go (ooh)
Right until the ends of the earth (aah)
I'll get no sleep
Till I find you (get no sleep)
To tell you when I've found you
I love you

Ooh, take my breath
