[Chorus]
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you

[Verse 1]
I don't know, how does it go?
I promise that I love you
So I'll bet it all on me and you
I'll bet it all, you're bulletproof
Let's throw away our backup plans
And people might not understand
Who cares about if they approve?
I'd face them all to be with you

[Chorus]
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
We could dance, you could throw the flowers
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you

[Verse 2]
I heard that once a wise man said
"Only fools go rushing in"
But I'm not the type to overthink
When something feels so right
And I promise I mean every word
I'll paint the world that you deserve
Every color you'd imagine
I can't wait for it to happen 'cause

[Chorus]
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
We could dance, you could throw the flowers
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you

[Verse 3]
I heard that once a wise man said
"Only fools go rushing in"
But I'm not the type (I'm not the type), to overthink (Overthink)
I'm not the type to overthink

[Chorus]
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you




[Intro]
It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure in my life

[Verse 1]
You're my sunlight on a rainy day
Would take my heart with you if you walked away
I'm a mess right now, I'm a wreck right now
I'm waiting for the moment that you let me down
If you cut the cord, I don't know what I'd do
Don't wanna skydive without my parachute
I'm a mess right now, baby, help me out
I'm scared I'm gonna wake up and you'll let me down

[Pre-Chorus]
This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night

[Chorus]
It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure in my life
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, I've never been so sure in my life

[Verse 2]
If there's a door to heaven, baby, you're the key
And if I had to beg, I'd be on my knees
Oh, please don't say anything has changed
You're the one I wanna wake up next to every day

[Pre-Chorus]
This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night

[Chorus]
It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure in my life
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, I've never been so sure in my life

[Bridge]
I want to be with you
I want to fly with you
I want to be with you

[Chorus]
It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure
Baby, I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
(Please, don't change your mind darling)
I don't wanna let go, I've never been so sure in my life (Oh, yeah)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh


[Verse 1]
So you leave tomorrow, just sleep the night
I promise I will make things right
I'll make you breakfast, the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow, just let me try

[Pre-Chorus]
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave

[Chorus]
Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on

[Verse 2]
Just one more night lying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right, just gotta make sense of it
And you'll be gone in the morning and you'll be over this
Just one more night so I can forget

[Chorus]
Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on


[Bridge]
When you go, I can't watch you leave
Just promise me you'll sneak out when I'm asleep
And when you go, and you're miles down the road
I wake up wishing everything was just a dream

[Chorus]
Just stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on and stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone and I, I'm keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
Just act like you love me so I can go on

Lyrics from snippet

[Chorus]
You got me addicted
But you still leave me in pieces, woah, yeah
Even though you're my obsession
You may never be my possession

You are the freedom in my heart
You have the freedom of my heart
You are my blood running through my cold earth
My soul weans for you because I’m addicted



(Verse 1)
Day after day
I will walk and I will play
But the day after today
I will stop and I will start

(Chorus)
I've given you a decision to make
Things to lose, things to take
Just as she's about ready to cut it up
She says "Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!"
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!
Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!

(Verse 2)
Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow
And say goodnight

(Bridge)
Oh ma-mama, mama mo-ma-mum
Take a look now at what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
Went downtown and bought him a gun

So don't you shoot that thing at me
Don't you shoot that thing at me
You know you got my sympathy
But don't you shoot that thing at me

(Verse 3)
Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow
And say goodnight

Add it up! Add it up!
Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!




[Verse 1]
Re-rewind Friday night, never forget it, how you let me go
No more lies, I'll be fine, know where I'm headed, probably shoulda known
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me"
Fool me once, told you twice, gonna regret it, now you're all alone, yeah

[Chorus]
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes, you can't hide, try to forget me, but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets you weren't ready when you left me there
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me"
Yeah, bet it hurts it gets worse, you know nobody, said it would be fair, oh

[Chorus]
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

[Bridge]
And now there's something in your way
'Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day
And it hurts 'cause

[Chorus]
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste and the aftertaste


[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes & Astrid S]
Never thought that we would end up here
Should've known it from the start
I know you mean it when you say you love me
But we're trying way too hard
Used to think that we would last forever
How could I have been so wrong?
Never thought I'd be the one to say this
What if our time has come and gone?

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Astrid S]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air

[Verse 2: Astrid S & Shawn Mendes]
Always tryna put your two cents in
And expecting me to change
Tried to fix me up but I'm not broken
All you do is leave me stained
Told you not to tie me down too quickly
Take it slow, it's not a race
And you keep on tryna reel me in but
All I really need is space


[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Astrid S]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air

[Bridge: Shawn Mendes]
Trying to hold me down but I'm surfacing
It’s hard to let you go but I gotta leave

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Astrid S]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, I'm coming up for air
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air

[Verse 1]
She would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

[Chorus]
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

[Verse 2]
She would always tell herself, she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand, it will be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
And she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way


[Chorus]
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah

[Bridge]
A little too much
I said a little too much, oh

[Chorus]
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

[Chorus]
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

And we back
And we back
And we back

And we back
And we back
And we back

This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé

Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll probably cry at my own service

Cause it was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
You know what I mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the words
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third


This is the music's all we got
So we might as well give it all we got (yeah)
This is the music's all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Cause this is all we got

I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
Doesn't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day

Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Cause this is all we got

[Verse 1]
It's a fairytale I can't explain
Full of words I don't know how to say
And without a little twist of fate
I know I'd still be searching, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breakin'

She's got a bad reputation
But she's all that... all that I want

[Outro]
She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home

Elle a mauvaise réputation
Elle prend le plus long chemin pour rentrer à la maison
Et tous mes amis l'ont vu nue
Ou bien c'est l'histoire qu'ils racontent
Des erreurs, on en fait tous
Mais ils ne veulent pas la laisser tranquille, non
Car elle a mauvaise réputation
Mais je sais ce qu'ils ne savent pas


Et je me fiche de ce qu'ils disent à ton sujet bébé
Ils ne savent pas ce que tu as traversé
Crois moi je peux être celui qui te traitera comme une dame
Laisse moi voir ce qu'il y a en toi, tout ce dont j'ai besoin c'est toi


Elle a une mauvaise réputation
Personne ne l'approche
À la recherche d'une âme quand elle est brisée
Ça me glace le cœur
Et dans les profondeurs elle y coule
Je la supplie "s'il te plaît ne fait pas attention"
Elle a une mauvaise réputation
Mais elle est tout, tout ce dont j'ai besoin



Et je me fiche de ce qu'ils disent à ton sujet bébé
Ils ne savent pas ce que tu as traversé
Crois moi je peux être celui qui te traitera comme une dame
Laisse moi voir ce qu'il y a en toi, tout ce dont j'ai besoin c'est toi


Personne ne la connais de la manière dont je la connais "dis-le"
Personne ne sait la façon dont le temps nous l'a montré "dis-le"
Personne ne la connais de la manière dont je la connais "dis-le"
Elle a une mauvaise, elle a une mauvaise
Personne ne la connais de la manière dont je la connais "dis-le"
Personne ne sait la façon dont le temps nous l'a montré "dis-le"
Personne ne la connais de la manière dont je la connais "dis-le"
Elle a une mauvaise, elle a une mauvaise


Et je me fiche de ce qu'ils disent à ton sujet bébé

Shawn Peter Raul Mendes (born August 8, 1998) is a Canadian singer. He attracted a following in 2013, when he began posting song covers on the popular video sharing application Vine. The following year, he caught the attention of artist manager Andrew Gertler & Island Records A&R Ziggy Chareton which led to him signing a deal with the record label.

Mendes went on to release his debut single "Life of the Party", which become successful in his native Canada as well as internationally. Following the release of Life of the Party, he has released both an EP and a studio album, and has headlined a successful solo tour.
Mendes was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and was raised in Pickering, a suburb of the city. He is the son of Karen, a real estate agent, and Manuel Mendes, a businessman. His father is of Portuguese descent (from a family from Lagos), while his mother is English. He first started posting cover videos on the popular social video app Vine in 2013 and picked up millions of views and followers in a matter of months, becoming well known for his six-second snippets of renditions of many popular songs. Artist manager Andrew Gertler discovered Mendes online in January 2014, bringing him to Island Records where he eventually signed and released his first single "Life of the Party" in June 2014. He is the youngest artist to debut in the top 25 with a debut song on the Billboard Hot 100, making to number 24 for the week ending July 12, 2014 at 15 years, 11 months and 4 days of age.

Prior to his signing, Mendes toured as a member of the MagCon Tour[5] alongside other young artists and social media sensations such as Nash Grier, Cameron Dallas, Jack & Jack, and more.[6] Mendes was also on a nationwide tour with Austin Mahone as an opening act and released his debut major label EP in July, with a debut album due out later in 2014. He won the Teen Choice award in 2014 for Webstar in Music.

Taking it slow isn't easy if as far as you go

[Verse 1]
Right now, I'm alone inside the airport
And you're all at a bar in our hometown
Feels like we've been living different lives
The music's loud and everybody's dancing
How many nights I've missed, yeah, I've lost count
Haven't seen your faces in a while

[Chorus]
I should call my friends
I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friends

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna miss another birthday
Feels like it's been forever since nineteen
I just wanna be right where you are
I miss how it was when we wishеd we were oldеr
Feeling so far when I wanna be closer

I should call my friends
I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again

Ooh, don't wanna be alone for one more night
Ooh, I know you gotta make some sacrifices
But I should call my friends

I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again

Oh, his eyes, how I love his eyes
Oh, his smile, how I want his smile
His hair, so Voluptuous
I just want him now

[Chorus]
'Cause he's Cameron Dallas, he's my boyfriend
Oh, I love him so
And you can't have him 'cause he's all my own
It's Cameron Dallas
Cameron Dallas, he's my boyfriend
Oh, I love him so
Cameron Dallas, he's my boyfriend
And I love him so, Cameron Dallas


[Chorus]
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine what a world would be

[Verse 1]
Without you, all the birds would stop their songs
Without you, all things right would feel so wrong

[Chorus]
I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be

[Verse 2]
Without you, I'd always be alone
Without you, I don't know where to go

[Chorus]
I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world could be
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine
I can't imagine, no
I can't imagine, no, what a world would be
Without you


[Outro]
I'd always be alone
I'd always be alone
Cool, that's good for now



[Chorus]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You're just like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last, love has arrived
And I just thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Verse 1]
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothin' else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
So if you feel how I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Hook]

And if it's quite alright
I need you, baby
For the lonely nights
My, pretty baby

I can't take my eyes off of you

[Verse 1: Brian]
What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?

[Chorus: Brian]
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Verse 2: AJ]
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh

[Pre-Chorus: AJ and Nick]
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
(What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?)
Getting close to you, but here we are


[Chorus: Nick]
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Bridge: Howie and Kevin]
Is it love? Is it fate?
Who am I? Who's to say?
Don't know exactly what it means (Ooh, oh, yeah)
''Is it love? Is it fate?''
''Where it leads, who can say?''
''Maybe you and I were meant to be''

[Chorus: Nick and Brian]
What, what
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Two in a million, once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you (My arms around you)
Two in a million (It's like two in a million), once in a life, yeah (Woah)
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
Two in a million, once in a life
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
Two in a million, once in a life


[Outro: Brian]
What if I never run into you?
And what if you never smiled at me?

[Verse 1]
Oh
You were crying, when I told you that
I was leaving and might never come back
Hmm, I was dreaming of a warmer place
And if I made it, it'd be okay

[Chorus]
The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California

[Verse 2]
All those dreams that, one by one came true
Felt like nothing, cause I wasn't with you
And tell me what that means
And tell me why am I dying
Thought this was what I needed
But that was a mistake

[Chorus]
The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California


[Bridge]
You were crying, when I told you that
I was leaving, now I wanna come back

[Chorus]
The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California, yeah
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard

Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so right
By doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
By doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars


I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four letter word
Make that money
Watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

And I feel something so wrong
By doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayig hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars


Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learned

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learned

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learned

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learned

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
We'll be counting stars



[Verse 1]
Think I don't need a watch to tell the time
Think I don't need the sun to help me shine
Think I don't need a girl to be alright
Guess I didn't know
Thought I didn't need shoes on my feet
Thought I didn't need a bed to fall asleep
Thought I didn't need love to be complete
Guess I didn't know

[Chorus]
That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me

[Verse 2]
You're all I think about when I'm awake
Part of every night and every day
And everything's a mess when you're away
Now I know
All of this is getting really old
I'm having trouble sleeping on my own
Feeling like a house but not a home
I want you to know

[Chorus]
That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me

[Bridge]
Guess I need a watch to tell the time
Guess I need the sun to help me shine
And I really need you in my life
Now I know

[Chorus]
That you give me this crazy feeling
And you won't have to wait no more for me, for me
And I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me




Я забыл о том, что мешает мне спать
Стучу молотком и не по двери опять
Чёрным мотыльком ты летишь ко мне
Уснём с тобой вдвоём под рассказы о Луне
Только ты и я, они все не в счёт
Мысли в облаках, это моё ремесло, е-е
[Куплет]
Я забыл о том, что мешает мне спать
Стучу молотком и не по двери опять
Чёрным мотыльком ты летишь ко мне
Уснём с тобой вдвоём под рассказы о Луне
Только ты и я, они все не в счёт
Мысли в облаках, это моё ремесло, е-е
[Куплет]
Здесь лесной пожар (что блять?!)
Годзилла наступает, это огнистан (пау-пау-пау-пау)
Я скурю это сам (sneak)
Мне настолько похуй, я сжёг весь свой нал (у-е-е-й)
На мне эти цепи (bling)
Настолько криповый, будто фильм "Hellraiser" (hellraiser)
Эта сука опять звонит мне на Razr (Motorola)
Я не беру трубку, не звони мне, детка (меня не достать)
[Припев]
Заряжаю свой AK (грр-р-ра)
Shawty гладит ствол, ей нужен я (ей нужен я, ей нужен я)
Зови меня Брэм Стокер, детка (вампир)
Ты попала в паутину, никуда не деться (не-е-е-т, не-а)
Дохлый Мураками
Завядшие цветы на моих джинсах, парень
Это паучий дрип, паук работал, парень (я работал)
На всех пальцах кольца, курим трэп-гербарий (у-е-е-й)


[Verse 1]
Guess there's something about it
That I can't explain
We could see other people
But it's never the same
You could be in Toronto
And I could be in L.A
And we could wait too long
But it's never too late

[Chorus]
And if twenty years went by without you
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love

[Verse 2]
We tried to deny it
Ever since we were kids
Yeah, we both tried to fight it
But we never win
We tell everybody, yeah
That we were just friends
But the more that I kiss you
The less it makes sense


[Chorus]
And if twenty years went by without you
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love

[Bridge]
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love

[Chorus]
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love


[Outro]
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love



[Verse 1]
You've got my heart, but I can't let you keep it, babe
'Cause I won't be sure that I can stay
And don't waste your time trying to pull me in
'Cause I'm just a mess you don't wanna fix
Just promise me one thing that you won't forget

[Verse 1]
Oh, I don't understand it when you talk like that
Swear I thought you were joking and that's why I laughed
'Cause it sounds like you wasted but it's 10 am
Maybe I'm going crazy, but I don't think I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me just a smile
Baby stop playing with me
Am I in denial?
Maybe

[Chorus]
But lately everything has been perfect
And your friends seem to trust me
And you told me you love me
And the rest was just wobbling
Girl I try and I try but still can't decipher the words that you're saying
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language

[Verse 2]
Girl I can't understand you when you act like that
Yeah your eyes are looking through me, like I'm made of glass
And my lips try to kiss you, but you don't kiss back
No, I don't understand you when you act like that

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me just a smile
Baby stop playing with me
Am I in denial?
Maybe

[Chorus]
But lately everything has been perfect
And your friends seem to trust me
And you told me you love me
Than the rest was just wobbling
Oh, I try and I try but still can't decipher the words that you're saying
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language




[Verse 1]
We run about a million miles an hour
And I do my best to try to do it in style
Haven't seen you in a while, girl
Our love is on trial
You run wild, you run wild
When I call you, you never wanna pick up
'Cause everything that I do is never, ever enough
You only like it when it rains
And when I'm stuck in the mud
You run wild, you run wild, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love

[Verse 2]
I'm not asking for much, I'm just tryna be fair
This road we're on is going nowhere
If we keep on running like a couple of kids
Who just get lost in the woods and now they're losing their wits
I'm overcome with it, this is ridiculous
How every time we get together, you're the one I miss?
I feel powerless and I don't want to split
You run wild, you run wild

[Chorus]
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love, yeah
Whoa-oh

[Bridge]
That's it, it's now or never, I can't do this forever
'Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
That's it, it's now or never, and I can't do this forever
'Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
Yeah

[Chorus]
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love

(Dream, dream, dream, dream)

[Verse 1]
Hello, hello, hello, can I hear an echo?
Purple, red, and yellow, I can't wait to get home
Head down on the pillow
Holding you is all I think about
You're asleep in London, I wish you were coming
Back home to me, darling, you're too far away
Count back from one hundred
Holding you is all I think about

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, when I'm apart from you
I just shut my eyes, all I have to do

[Verse 2]
Hello, hello, hello, walking through a meadow
Full of sunflowers, picking off the petals
I don't wanna wake up without you laying next to me, yeah
I'm no good at waiting, all the separation
Feeling suffocated, I just need to breathe
And I'm starting to hate it
I can't wait to fall asleep


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, when I'm apart from you
I just close my eyes
And all I have to do

Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you

A drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most
Cause you are my heaven

I don't wanna waste the weekend
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go
And as my train rolls down the east coast
I wonder how you keep warm
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on

Still I can't let you be
Most nights I hardly sleep
Don't take what you don't need, from me

Just a drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most
Cause you are my heaven

Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore
Heaven doesn't seem far away
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore
Heaven doesn't seem far away

Oooh Oooh

Just a drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most


My head is underwater
I can't do this much longer
I lose my mind when I think that it's over

[Intro: Lil Dicky]
What up, world? It's your boy, just one of the guys down here. Well, I could be more specific. Uh, I'm a human, and I just wanted to, you know, for the sake of all of us earthlings out there, just wanted to say:

We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
I'm a man (Hello?)
Can you hear me? (Anyone out there? Hello?)
I've trudged the Earth for so damn long
And still don't know shit (What's going on?)
I hope it's not a simulation (Huh)
Give each other names like Ahmed and Pedro
And, yeah, we like to wear clothes, girls still look beautiful
And it covers up our human dick (Woo), eat a lot of tuna fish
But these days, it's like we don't know how to act
All these shootings, pollution, we under attack on ourselves
Like, let's all just chill (Hey), respect what we built (Hey)
Like look at the internet! It's cracking as hell
Fellas, don't you love to cum when you have sex? (Ayy)

But we're living on the same Earth
(We love you, we love you)
Have you ever been to Earth?
Everyone who is listening has been to Earth, Ariana
(We love you, we love you)
We're not making music for aliens here
Are we gonna die?
You know what, Bieber? We might die
(We love you, we love you)
I'm not going to lie to you
I mean, there's so many people out here who don't think global warming's a real thing. You know? We gotta save this planet. We're being stupid
Unless we get our shit together now

...your mind start to control your hearts desire
You should stop and take it easy, easy
What do..



You're my sun in my day
You're always shining in my face
If i could give you something you want
Let me buy everything you want




[Andy]
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause—

[Mikey]
Because you know I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble, I'm all 'bout that—

[Brooklyn]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in—

[Rye]
You're all that matters to me, oh—

[Jack]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking, yeah—

[Andy]
And I won't be who you ask me to be—

We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[All]
3, 4!

[Jack, Rye, & All]
Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control (out of my control)
Pushing, pulling, and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones like
Whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening

[Brooklyn]
Take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

[Andy & Rye]
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes (all it takes)
I'll leave you with the memory
And the (aftertaste)

[Rye & Jack]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking
Falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Brooklyn & All]
I know I can treat you better (than he can)
And any girl like you deserves a (gentleman)

So please have mercy, mercy on my heart (begging you, begging you, please)
Please have mercy, mercy on my heart

[Mikey, with Rye]
Oh, I've been shaking

You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

[Andy, Rye, & Jack]
It isn't in my blood (oh)
It isn't in my blood (oh)
It isn't in my blood

[Rye]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
'Cause I can't seem to get you off my mind


[Pre Chorus]
This morning I was listening to your heartbeat
Singing songs
I see you right beside me, but you're hardly here at all
You hate me 'cause I'm pulling off the covers
Picking you up out of this bed
I promise that it's only 'cause I love you so bad

[Chorus]
And darling, I know that it's dark, but you're safe out here in my arms
I'll be right by your side in the eye of the storm
And darling, I know that it's hard
Hold you close when it all falls apart
I'll be right by your side in the eye of the storm

[Pre Chorus]
This morning I was listening to your heartbeat

[Chorus]
And darling, I know that it's dark, but you're safe out here in my arms
I'll be right by your side in the eye of the storm

Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when stuff look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place

[Verse 1]
Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak, open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changing our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feeling your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You (Yeah) are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Yeah)
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

[Verse 2]
Fast forward a couple years, yeah
Grown up in the place that we live
Make love, then we fight
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night, baby
I guess we can't control
What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You (Yeah) are bringing out a different kind of me (Ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you (Ooh)
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

[Bridge]
Every time I see you, baby, I get lost
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
Every night I'm with you, I fall more in love
Now I'm laying by your side
Everything feels right since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You, yeah, are bringing out a different kind of me (Ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you (Ooh)
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in...


[Verse 1]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 2]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you


[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I

[Breakdown]
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you



[Verse 1]
She's a good girl, loves her mama
She loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy about Elvis
She loves horses and her boyfriend too
Yeah, yeah
It's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway running through the yard
I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart

[Chorus]
And I'm free
Free fallin'
And I'm free
Free fallin'

[Verse 2]
All the vampires walking through the valley
They move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

[Chorus]
And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Woah, I'm free


Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt

Told you I'd let them go

And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya


Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my

[There's Nothing Holding Me Back]
You are sitting at the right hand of the Father it means what is true you came to me
I think of that
I want to put Turkish control over the fire
You don't have the space, bwahahaha
People can fight the moon, I think

[Skit]
Yeah, I think so

[There's Nothing Holding Me Back continued]
And maybe I should try to meet and socialize
Education, yeah
Well done, I’m appalled
If you are dying, pie
You can use all my blogs
This is not my baby
What's so distracting about my wrist?
The election was accurate
This is not my baby

[Skit]
Who's baby is this? No, but actually, who’s baby is this? Did someone lose a baby? Anybody? No? Okay

[Treat You Better]
I don't like lying
My cat, worshiping all the temples
Could you tell me if I'm in a different place?
However, I looked at my hair
How good do you feel when she's dead?
And not have a place in a container
Do not touch this thing
You can see in the future?
I can save you
Girls like you must be boys
Why waste time, Mr. Conroy?
Lost wine
When he died, and then cry
I can work hard on her
That's nice


[Skit]
So this song was always about a masculinity complex

[Mercy]
Mummy
You have no power
Private Centipede
But I fell into the hand of death
Show me mathematics
Then you will take my ass
Salmon
I am a kid
Please crush me
Your heart has disappeared
This does not mean that it hurts
Do you think I'm RIP
Oh, please, thank you, Good morning, Libby
Oh, please, thank you, Good morning, Libby

[Skit]
Good morning, Libby! Hi! Hi Libby, how you doin'?

[Stitches]
I think that he's already dead
But no mention was all this always in liquidation
It is higher than the hippopotamus
Who’s thinking of me again? That’s why it's not me and I have no nipples
I think I am a cock
I, I know they are breastfeeding
Teresa’s call to pull the cover
Cervical whiplash
You can find pasta as you bleed
Smoothies falling on his knees
Now I have no clothes
I want a ship
Happy bargains on me
Yes please
Now I have no clothes
I want a ship
Now I have no clothes
I want a ship
Now I have no clothes
I want a ship

I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty
In the moonlight
Overthrew you
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne
She cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Intro]
I'm falling in, I'm falling down
I wanna begin but I don't know how
To let you know how I'm feeling
I'm high on hope, yeah, I'm reeling

[Chorus]
And I won't let you go, now that you know
I've been crazy for you all this time
I've kept it close, always hoping
With a heart on fire

[Verse 1]
Hand in hand, sparkling eyes
The days are bright, but so are the nights
To let you know how I'm feeling
Once I was through, now I'm winning

[Chorus]
And I won't let you go, now that you know
I've been crazy for you all this time
I've kept it close, always hoping
With a heart on fire

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
No I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
And truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a girlfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner waiting for this to be over
With this girl who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta he-

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we just kick it and just listen
To some music with the message like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand it
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with this girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to this boy who's throwing up cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?


Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here

Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be this way
So tell my people that I'm ready when their ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

And I'll be over here
No I'll be over here
No I'll be over here



[Intro]
I can't get much higher

[Verse 1]
New York in summertime
Get close with a bottle of wine
Last year was a broken heart
Last year was a broken heart
Last year was a broken heart
Damn, flip it around, what a beautiful start
You and me on the top of the roof
Slow dance in the light of the moon, yeah
Never thought it would get this far
Never thought it would get this far, no
Never thought it would get this far
Wow, flip it around, what a beautiful start

[Chorus]
The drinks are gettin' better, the view is lookin' nice
As long as we're together, no, I can't get much higher, I, I
No, I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever, I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together, no, I can't get much higher, I, I
No, I can't get much higher

[Verse 2]
All eyes are lookin' at us
But I can't stop fallin' in love
Always been the one that I want, yeah
Always been the one that I want, yeah
Always been the one that I want
Wow, look at us now, damn what have I done?
I almost can't believe it
So please don't wake me if I'm dreamin'
Whenever I'm with you (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
The drinks are gettin' better, the view is lookin' nice
As long as we're together, no, I can't get much higher, I, I
No, I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever, I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher (Can't get much higher), I, I
No, I can't get much higher

[Bridge]
Say, say you won't let go
All I know, oh-oh
Is I can't get much higher

[Chorus]
I can't get much higher
The drinks are gettin' better (Better), the view is lookin' nice (Na, na)
As long as we're together, no, I can't get much higher (Can't get much higher), I, I
No, I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever, I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together, no, I can't get much higher, I, I
No, I can't get much higher




[Verse 1]
Stop, take it in
And I breathe for a minute
I think too much when I'm alone
I never win when I
Keep all my thoughts inside
So I'll pick up the phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And my dad says, "Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I haven’t seen you lately
But you’re always on my mind"

[Chorus]
I don't know what
You’re going through
But there’s so much life
Ahead of you
And it won’t slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah

[Verse 2]
These days are flying by
Weeks feel like minutes
I can't remember being small
I try to figure it out
I can't seem to find out how
I guess I don't know much at all

[Pre-Chorus]
And my dad says
"Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I haven’t seen you lately
But you’re always on my mind"

[Chorus]
I don't know what
You’re going through
But there’s so much life
Ahead of you
And it won’t slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah

[Bridge]
All we can do is hold on
Yeah, you just gotta hold on
Just, just hold on
Just hold on for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And my dad says
"Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright."

[Chorus]
I don't know what
You’re going through
But there’s so much life
Ahead of you
And it won’t slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah
Yeah, you just gotta hold on
Just hold on for me

At the Adelaide Street, it's back in LA
It reminds me that
I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby I'm just tryna be honest
I'm tryna be honest with ya
I don't wanna hurt you
But I'm tryna be honest with ya




[Verse 1]
Oh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
And you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself
You, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
Then the crowd came and pulled you away
Then you were gone

[Chorus]
Oh yeah And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name

[Verse 2]
Everywhere that I go
I see your face and it kills me to know
That you'll never know what you did to me
And now you're gone, yeah, I can't stop thinking about you

[Chorus]
Cause I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name
Yeah I don't even know your name

[Bridge]
I'm running, I'm searching, and I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking until I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
I'm running, I'm searching, and I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking until I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running

[Chorus]
And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name


[Verse 1] (I Want You Back)
Say, I remember how you felt on that day
But I forget all the faces except one
And what hurts the most is that I'll never know
What we could've been
But I guess that just means it wasn't fate

[Verse 2] (I Don't Even Know Your Name)
And I was like ooh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
But you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself, woah, clap those hands!
Oh, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
Then the crowd came and pulled you away
Then you were gone, woah, woah, yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day, no, no, no
Cause I don't even know your name
No, I don't even know your name, no

[Interlude]

Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
I'm running, I'm searching baby, sing it out!
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart, no

[Chorus] (Aftertaste)
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

[Interlude]
This is Kid In Love everybody, sing it with me!

[Verse 3] (Kid In Love)
I know that we just met and maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine
The way you’re lighting up the room, caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door, we don’t have to say goodbye
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine, yeah, yeah


[Interlude]
Alright New York City, sing this as loud as you can
Here we go

Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby

But I don’t ever wanna grow up

But I don't ever wanna grow up

[Bridge]
Cause you make me feel, like I've got it all, yeah

And you make me feel, baby, like I've got it all, no, no
Now you make me feel, yeah, like I'm just a kid in love

And you got me singing

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
Now since I see you
You, in his arms

[Postlude]
Thank you so much!



[Verse 1: Elvis Presley]
There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why?
Oh why, oh why can't my dream come true?
Oh why?

[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood & Shawn Mendes]
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
The doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear?

[Verse 3: Post Malone & Darius Rucker]
We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain (Oh yeah)
As long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly

[Verse 4: Elvis Presley & Blake Shelton]
Deep in my heart there's a tremblin' question
Still I am sure that the answer
Answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark
There's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while I can think, while I can talk
While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream
Oh, please let my dream come true
Right now
Let it come true right now
Oh yeah

[Outro: Elvis Presley]
Thank you, good night


[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 1]
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?


[Verse 2]
I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Bridge]
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you, no


[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you? (Can't have you)
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?



[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't think without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 1]
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
Everything means nothing if I can't have you

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't think without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't think without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 2]
I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
Everything means nothing if I can't have you

Can't think without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

Can't think without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Bridge]
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you now

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't think without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't think without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that

He knows
Dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killing me?
He knows, he knows
D-d-does he know
Another's hands have touched my skin?
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello & Both]
It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away (I'm slipping away)
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone
She's not coming home (I'm not coming home)
Coming home, coming home

[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes]
I know
When she looks me in the eyes
They don't seem as bright
No more, no more
I know
That she loved me at one time
Would I promise her that night
Cross my heart and hope to die

[Pre-Chorus: Both & Camila Cabello & Shawn Mendes]
It's tearing me apart (It's tearing me apart)
She's slipping away (I'm slipping away)

Oh, there she goes again
Every morning is the same
You walk on by my house
I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are
From where I'm standing
You got me thinking
What we could because

I keep craving, craving
You don't know it, but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words
They wanna say to you
This is typical of love
Can't wait anymore
Won't wait I need to tell you
How I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams
You're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night
That we kiss for the first time

Or is that just me
And my imagination?

We walk
We left we spend our time
Walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined
A feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone
Thinking we could not belong
To something so damn beautiful
So damn beautiful

I keep craving, craving you
Don't know it, but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words
They wanna say to you

This is typical of love
Can't wait anymore
Won't wait I need to tell you how I feel
When I see us together forever

In my dreams
You're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night
That we kiss
For the first time

Or is that just me
And my imagination?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Imagination
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Imagination
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

In my dreams
You're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night
That we kissed
For the first time

Or is that just me
And my imagination?

I keep craving, craving
You don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words
They wanna say to you




[Verse 1]
Oh, there she goes again, every morning it's the same
You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standin'
You got me thinkin' what we could be 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

[Chorus]
In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

[Verse 2]
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinkin' we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

[Chorus]
In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination? (Woah, oh)

[Bridge]
Imagination (Woah, oh, woah, oh)
Imagination (Woah, oh)
(Woah, oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, ooh)

[Chorus]
In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

[Outro]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you

Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing

Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Get lost in wonderland (Ooh)

[Intro:]
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
I know that we just met and maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine
The way you’re lighting up the room caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door, we don’t have to say goodbye
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
To waste time tonight

[Chorus]
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
If this is what it’s like falling in love
Then I don’t ever wanna grow up
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
It’d be cool if it was the two of us
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up

[Verse 2]
Said your place is kinda close and your 'rents are out of town
Baby there’s no pressure, but if you’re down I’m down
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
To just talk tonight
If you’re feeling kinda crazy, turn down the lights
We can take our time, do whatever you like
It’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine


[Chorus]
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
If this is what it’s like falling in love

Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
It’d be fine if it was the two of us
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up

Said, your place is kinda cozy
Your 'rents are out of town
Baby, there's no pressure
But if you're down, I'm down
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
Just start tonight
If you're feeling kinda crazy

Three in the morning and I should be asleep
I'm lying in bed, watching you sing to me

"Don't cry" - or do
Whatever makes you comfortable
I’m tired too, there's nothin' left to say

Not A love I  have to fake




[Intro]
Look up at the stars, they're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground

[Verse 1]
It's a Friday night
And the streetlights are all saying your name
They always say your name
Before you go home, I should let you know
I'm so glad that you came
I know that we went late

[Chorus]
But look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far, the universe is ours
I'm not gonna let you down

[Pre-Chorus]
I am feeling so lucky (Lucky, lucky, lucky)
The sun shining down on me (On me, on me, on me)
Got these angels all around mе
I'll never be alonе

Look up at the stars, they're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far, the universe is ours
And I'm not gonna let you down

[Verse 2]
Finally we've met, now the lights are set
It's taken us 'til now
To be together in this town, yeah
A couple of years we've been making plans
Somehow you always seem to understand
So let me spend the night in wonderland with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I am feeling so lucky (Lucky, lucky, lucky)
The sun shining down on me (On me, on me, on me)
Got these angels all around me
I'll never be alone

[Verse 1]
I walk down the street and all I can see
Is people taking pictures of what they're 'bout to eat
Did you even notice the girl sitting across from you?
I sit in your room with nothing to do
Victim to the screen between me and you
Guess there's somebody else that you'd rather be talking to

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, time out, help me

[Chorus]
'Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost
And I wanna get lost

[Verse 2]
We go out to shows, but why do we go
If we're only gonna see it through the screens on our phones?
If we're all here together, then why are we watching alone?
The world's so much bigger than posing for pictures
If all that we need's at the tip of our fingers
Then how did this happen that we all fell so out of touch?


[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, time out, help me

[Chorus]
'Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost

[Bridge]
Tell me how it feels 'cause I know the hardest part
Is when you're holding something real, you can see it in the dark
I'll tell you how it feels and here's the hardest part
If you wanna reach for something real, you gotta see it in the dark

[Chorus]
I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
And nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost
I wanna get lost
And I wanna get lost

Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight, baby?

[Instrumental]




[Verse 1]
All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone, yeah
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy, baby
I just wanna see ya
All I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight baby
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave yeah
No I'm about to leave

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight baby?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight baby
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
And the only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I (oh)
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight baby?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight, yeah
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Said I can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight, baby?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind, yeah

[Outro]
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
No I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind





[Verse 1]
Can I open my mouth and let the words come spilling out?
Show you the side of me that I haven’t figured out?
And I want you to know all the things that I think about
Can I let it out?

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I want you to be there
Yeah, I want you to be there

[Chorus]
If I told you my secrets and I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts and showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me

[Verse 2]
Could we talk through the night if I told you I never sleep?
Could you be the air in my lungs when I can’t breathe?
And sometimes I’m not quite as drunk as I wanna be
Umm So I want you to be there, be there, be there

[Chorus]
If I told you my secrets and I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts and showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me

[Bridge]
So much of me I wanna let go
So many things I need you to know
So much of me I wanna let go, ohh
So much of me I wanna let go
So many things I need you to know
So much of me I wanna let go, ohh ohh

[Chorus]
If I told you my secrets and I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts and showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me




[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes with Taylor Swift]
We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop
I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty
See, I finally got you now, honey, I won't let you fall

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Shawn Mendes, Shawn Mendes]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Shawn Mendes & Both]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you
I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true, for you, lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover (Save you a seat)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Shawn Mendes, Shawn Mendes & Taylor Swift]
Can I go where you go? (Can I go where you go, baby?)
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover


[Verse 1]
When I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of bed
They make a song that sounds so simple
But it dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

[Verse 2]
So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go


[Chorus]
Let's write our story
And let's sing our song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
Memories after all
Memories after all

[Bridge]
You know
You gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go, oh
It's taking its toll
Deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go

[Outro]
We wrote our story
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall
Now those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all



[Verse 1]
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Verse 2]
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart

And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Bridge]
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath (Yeah)
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah

But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?

And what if I, what if I sin?

Just let me know, yeah

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up (Liftin' me up), liftin' me up (Yeah)
And tearin' me down (Down), tearin' me down (Down, down, yeah)
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done (Yeah)
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one (Yeah)


[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
I had a chip on my shoulder, had to let it go
'Cause unforgiveness keeps them in control
I came in with good intentions, then I let it go
And now I really wanna know

What if I, what if I trip? (Oh)
What if I, what if I fall? (I fall)

La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na



Did I just hear an alarm start ringing?
Did I see sirens go flying past?
Though I don't know what tomorrow's bringing
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater
I'm riding hot as a rocket blast
I just expected it ten years later
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

And you say oh no
Step on the brakes
Do whatever it takes
But stop this train
Slow, slow the lights turning red

But I say no no
Whatever I do
I barrel on though
And I don't complain
No matter what I try
I'm flying full speed ahead

I'm never worried to walk the wire
I won't do anything just half assed
But with the stakes getting somewhat higher
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

I found a woman I love
And I found an agent who loves me
Things might get bumpy but some people analyze every detail
Some people stall when they can't see the trail
Some people freeze out of fear that they'll fail
But I keep rollin' on

Some people can't get success with their art
Some people never feel love in their heart
Some people can't tell the two things apart
But I keep rollin' on

And oh, maybe I can't follow through
But oh, what else am I supposed to do?

I dreamed of writing like the high and mighty
Now I'm the subject of a bidding war
I met my personal Aphrodite
I'm doing things I never dreamed of before

We start to take the next step together
Found an apartment on seventy-third
The Atlantic Monthly's printing my first chapter
Two thousand bucks without rewriting one word

I left Columbia and I don't regret it
I wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it
My heart's been stolen
My ego's rolling
I just keep rollin' along...

And I think
Well, well, what else is in store?
Got all this and more before twenty-four
It's hard not to be sure
I'm spinning out of control
Out of control

I'm feeling panicked and rushed and hurried
I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed
But I'm so happy I can't get worried
About this singular impression
I've got a singular impression things are moving too fast


[Verse 1]
I want you close to me
I want you close, I want you closer
But when you're here with me
It's hard to tell just what you're after

[Pre-Chorus]
You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?

[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

[Verse 2]
This inconsistency, what does it mean?
You got me questioning, the way you act and take it back
Do I mean anything?
Just tell me honestly


[Pre-Chorus]
You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?

[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

[Bridge]
Are you playin' me, is this a game?
When you show up late, say love at 2 A.M
Then tell me you can't stay, girl, yeah
What do you want from me?
Baby, oh

[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad, baby
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

[Verse 1]
I saw you on a Sunday in a café
And all you did was look my way
And my heart started to race
And my hands started to shake, yeah
I heard you asked about me through a friend
My adrenaline kicked in
'Cause I've been askin' 'bout you too
And now we're right here in this room

[Chorus]
I get a little bit nervous around you
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
Get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Talk a little too much around you
(I talk a little too much, yeah)
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you
(I get a little self-conscious)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

[Verse 2]
We walked in the rain a couple blocks to your apartment
You told me to come inside, caught me staring in your eyes
And I'm not usually like this
But I like what you're doing to me, ah, what you're doing to me


[Chorus]
I get a little bit nervous around you
(I get a little bit nervous)
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
(I get a little bit stressed out)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Yeah, when I think about you, babe (oh yeah)
Talk a little too much around you
(I talk a little too much, yeah)
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you
(I get a little self-conscious)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

[Bridge]
You got me acting like I've never done this before
I promise I'll be ready when I walk through the door
And I don't know why
No, I don't know why
Yeah

[Chorus]
I get a little bit nervous around you
(I get a little bit nervous)
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
(I get a little bit stressed out)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe
Talk a little too much around you
(I talk a little too much, baby)
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you
(I get a little self-conscious)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

I love you guys to death, thank you so much



[Intro]
Thank you guys so much
I think uh, I don't, I don't really know how to explain this
I guess it's actually pretty simple, but
Um, when I'm onstage, and I'm performing, uh
A lot of the time, this is a very intimidating thing to do
As you could imagine, um, but
You guys are always so incredible every single time I perform
Singing your hearts out, and
As a performer
And more than that, as a person, that means the world to me
And it helps me, and I love it, and thank you so much for that
So yeah, I just wanna say that

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
I promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound

[Chorus]

I'm...
Making my way down this road
Feel the chill to the road
And I can barely see the lights
Wonder if she'll be here tonight

When I see her in my dreams
There's flowers blooming these are the tree's
Been searching for so long, yeah
I think it's bout time that I found this girl

And if you come with me
Promise you'll never bleed
I'm never gonna let you gooo

Let me take you home
I'll be the one you want
You'll never wanna see me gooo

Life can pass you by so quick
I didn't know it but my line is growing thick
And now I think I found the one, yeah
That I've been searching for so long

And if you come with me
Promise you'll never bleed
I'm never gonna let you gooo

Let me take you home
I'll be the one you want
You'll never wanna see me gooo

Just push the roads aside
Wanted to see you smile
And now I'm feeling so strong
Done walking down this road
Got what I want

And you're coming with me

And if you come with me
Promise you'll never bleed
I'm never gonna let you gooo

Let me take you home
I'll be the one you want
You'll never wanna see me go

And if you come with me
Promise you'll never bleed
I'm never gonna let you gooo

Let me take you home
I'll be the one you want
You'll never wanna see me go


[Verse 1]
Staring out my hotel window
Too much on my mind
Maybe we should keep it simple
We don't have to decide

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before don't even say It

[Chorus]
Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

[Verse 2]
I've never been a fan of heartbreak
So tell me what you want
Take my hands across your body
We don't have to hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before, don't even say It


[Chorus]
Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

[Bridge]
Cause I've been living only for this moment
And I don't wanna let it slip away
I've been living only for this moment
And I don't know how much that I can take, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises
Yeah baby, please no promises
Baby please no promises
Baby please
Baby please no promises

[Intro: The Vamps]
Cecilia, you’re breaking my heart
You’re shaking my confidence daily

[Verse 1: Brad]
Put your hands up, you’re surrounded
The whole love thing, I clowned it
Then who’s the joker? I guess I’m it
Cause I let it right go when I found it
Time has never been my best suit
Now I’ve got everything except you
You moved out of my heart, still got the bruise
I’d give it all back to be next to you

[Pre-Chorus: Brad]
I turn my radio up and it’s just my luck,
Why-y-y-y-y-y me??
I turn my TV on, it’s the same old song, why are you following me?
It’s like a "Missing you" sign is written on my face
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh?
It’s like everybody knows cause everywhere I go the whole world is singing to me, yeah

[Chorus: The Vamps]
Cecilia, you’re breaking my heart
You’re shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I’m down on my knees
I’m begging you please to come home
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh


[Verse 2: Brad & Shawn Mendes]
I had the girl of my dreams and now she’s all gone
Thought that we could last forever, I was all wrong
Said the talking was cheap and now I'm flat broke
She don’t even wanna see my face anymore
She don’t wanna say, where she's gone away
But she’s on replay in my, in my brain
I’ll do what it takes any time and place
We can turn a breakup into an outbreak

[Pre-Chorus: Brad & Shawn Mendes]
I turn my radio up and it’s just my luck,
Why-y-y-y-y-y me?
I turn my TV on, it’s the same old song, why are you following me?
It’s like a "Missing you" sign is written on my face
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh?
It’s like everybody knows cause everywhere I go the whole world is singing to me, yeah

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & All]
Cecilia, you’re breaking my heart
You’re shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I’m down on my knees
I’m begging you please to come home
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh


[Bridge: Brad]
Although we’re many miles apart but I still feel her
There’ll never be another one like my Cecilia
Oh where, oh where could she be? Does she still care about me?
When will she finally come back to, come back to me?

[Chorus: All]
Cecilia, you’re breaking my heart
You’re shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I’m down on my knees
I’m begging you please to come home
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh

[Verse 1]
Time warp in the middle of a daydream
Call you up ‘cause the time is wasting
Last drive, we got nowhere to go
Fear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle
Think fast, move quick, don’t stumble
We can’t do this alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Where do we go? We don’t know
Follow the wind, where it blows
Let’s make mistakes and don’t look back
It’s now or never

[Chorus]
One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

[Verse 2]
We’re young livin' with no fear
Kids runnin' wild, girls cryin' drunk tears
We don’t have this time for long
Yeah, we make big plans, spending all our change
Caught up in the night, oh, we missed the last train
It’s that time, and we’re leaving, home


[Pre-Chorus]
Where do we go? We don’t know
Follow the wind, where it blows
Let’s make mistakes and don’t look back
It’s now or never

[Chorus]
One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

[Refrain]
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

[Bridge]
Go home it’s over, but it’s not the end
Don’t wait ‘til you’re older to begin
Keep your composure and innocence
Where do we go? We don’t know
One of those nights, we’re driving around
In this boring ass town
One of those nights


[Refrain]
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

[Chorus]
One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

[Outro]
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
One of those nights, where she turns the lights down
And it’s only us now, one of those nights

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
Cutting all the cords, can't hear all your words
'Cause you're breaking, breaking, breaking up
Static on the line, guess we're out of time
'Cause we're breaking, breaking, breaking up

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
Something's been missing, we lost the transmission
I bet that you're wishing (just keep wishing)
You're so juvenile, we can't reconcile
I'm changing the dial

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
We're over, over, over
O-o-over and out
Don't you get the message?
Over, over, over

Too bad our love timed out
We're over, over, over

Over, over, over and I'm out

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
Calling all the boys, tryna make some noise
Wanna shake it, shake it, shake it up
Stop blowing up my phone, leave a message at the tone
'Cause we're breaking, breaking, breaking up


[Pre-Chorus: Cabello Cabello]
Something's been missing, we lost the transmission
I bet that you're wishing ( boy, just keep wishing)
You're so juvenile, we can't reconcile

Something's been missing, we lost the transmission
We're over, over, over, o-o-over and out
You're so juvenile, we can't reconcile
We're over, over, over and I'm out

[Verse 1]
She don't listen to a thing, 'less it feels right
Only dances when it's Kanye
She could take you one-on-one if she feels like
You'll be begging her for mercy, mercy

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But ooh, she's so specific when she's at my place
At my place

[Chorus]
She's got particular taste, yeah
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no
She just goes right for the face, yeah
She's so particular

[Verse 2]
Never pickin' up her phone 'less it rings twice
Only answers with a question, "Mhm?"
If I try to play it cool, it never goes right
Got me drownin', drownin', ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But ooh, she's so specific when she's at my place
At my place

You hit me up, it's late at night
This is the same old story
Your friends should take your phone away
I always give in when you tell me lies to reassure me
I always make the same mistakes, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy

[Chorus]
First you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please, I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm in your room, it's just us two
I feel you getting closer
You rest your head upon my chest, yeah
Deep down I know that this should be the last time I come over
You always leave me such a mess

Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
Love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
Yeah, yeah
Oh no no
You know I'm losin' my patience baby
Oh no no
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losing my patience

[Verse 1]
Taste the poison from your lips
Lately, we're as good as gone
Oh, our love is drunken in
Singing me my favorite song

[Pre-Chorus]
Me and you
We were made to break
I know the truth
But it's much too late

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
You're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

[Verse 2]
Oh, you know how much it hurts
Every time you say you hate me
But when we're making love, you make it worth it
I can't believe the places that you take me


[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use
We were made to break
I know the truth
And it's much too late

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

[Bridge]
Oh, and why can't I quit
When you break my heart open
I need you more than I know
Oh, and I can't resist
When you're up against my skin
I never wanna let you go

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, mhm
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, oh
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, yeah
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me

[Intro]
Yeah, it makes me wanna cry
Don't know what to do
It's so hard, but it's true
Everybody wants a piece

[Verse 1]
I get reckless, I'm obsessive
I'm pathetic and possessive
You're so sure it makes me insecure
You're majestic, mesmerizin'
Light the room up without tryin'
Baby, I'm so into you, it hurts

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, it just isn't fair
What you put in the air
I don't wanna share

[Chorus]
Everybody wants a piece of you
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do?
From the second you walked in the room, my night is ruined
Everybody wants a piecе

[Verse 2]
One, two, three
So do I, maybe I'm selfish
Just onе touch is so electric
Every little thing you do feels right, yeah
I'm sorry if I get protective
Need these boys to get the message
You know I'm yours, I know you're mine

[Chorus]
Everybody wants a piece of you, yeah
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do?
From the second you walked in the room, my night is ruined
Everybody wants a piece

[Bridge]
It's so hard, but it's true
It's so hard, but it's true
Everybody wants a piece

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, it just isn't fair
What you put in the air
I don't wanna share

[Chorus]
Everybody wants a piece of you
(Now they all want a piece)
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do?
(Nah, it just isn't fair, babe)
From the second you walked in the room, my night is ruined
Everybody wants a piece


Yeah, isso me faz chorar
Não sei o que fazer
É tão difícil, mas é verdade
Todos querem um pedaço

Eu fico imprudente, eu sou obsessivo
Eu sou patético e possessivo
Você tem tanta certeza que me deixa inseguro
Você é majestosa, hipnotizante
Ilumina a sala sem tentar
Baby, estou tão afim de você, isso machuca

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, não é justo
O que você coloca no ar
Eu não quero dividir

Todos querem um pedaço de você
Eu tenho ciúmes, mas quem não teria quando você tem essa aparência?
No segundo quе você entra na sala, minha noite está arruinada
Todos quеrem um pedaço

Um, dois, três
Eu também, talvez eu seja egoísta
Apenas um toque é tão eletrizante
Tudo que você faz soa certo, yeah
Desculpa se eu me torno protetor
Preciso que esses meninos recebam a mensagem
Você sabe que sou seu, eu sei que você é minha


Todos querem um pedaço de você
Eu tenho ciúmes, mas quem não teria quando você tem essa aparência?
No segundo que você entra na sala, minha noite está arruinada
Todos querem um pedaço

É tão difícil, mas é verdade
É tão difícil, mas é verdade
Todos querem um pedaço

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, não é justo
O que você coloca no ar
Eu não quero dividir

Todos querem um pedaço de você
(Agora todos querem um pedaço)
Eu tenho ciúmes, mas quem não teria quando você tem essa aparência?
(Não, não é justo, babe)
No segundo que você entra na sala, minha noite está arruinada
Todos querem um pedaço

[Chorus]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boat
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boat
Don't act like you my friend when we rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ay
Hundred bands inside my shorts, DeChino in it, ay
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, yay
Know that I been with the hits ever since a jit, ay
I made my first million, I'm like, "Woah, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that is lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave every girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no


[Chorus]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

And I'm like "Woah, damn, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds weigh, my teeths is sore
I got homies, let it blow, oh, no ho
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
Yeah I can't ever tell her no
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
Yeah I can't ever tell you no
I can't ever tell you no

[Verse 1]
It's hard to believe
You don't remember me at all
Am I hard to recognize?
You say "nice to meet you" every time
Yeah, and I made you laugh
I still remember what I said
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
You say "nice to meet you" every time

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we got a lot of mutual friends
Don't say my name, don't come up in your conversations, yeah

[Chorus]
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me
Like I got nothin' on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

[Verse 2]
I shouldn't stress about
The fact you're not impressed
Are you playing hard to get?
Or maybe you're not interested
I don't understand
Why everybody thinks you're sweet
'Cause I see the opposite
No, you're not so innocent


[Pre-Chorus]
I see the way you're lookin' through me right now
To see if there's somebody cooler around, yeah

[Chorus]
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me
Like I got nothin' on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, no
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?

[Chorus]
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me (yeah, nah, yeah)
You treat me
Like I got nothin' on you
Making beautiful look ugly (making beautiful look ugly)
You ain't the ruler of no country (you ain't the ruler of no country, babe)


[Outro]
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?
Yeah, you think you're too cool, no
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?

[Verse 1]
It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?
Die or let it go?

[Verse 2]
It's not that I don't care about the love you have
It's not that I don't want to see you smile
But there's no way that he can feel the same
'Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild


[Pre-Chorus]
How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

[Bridge]
You can tell me stop, if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it
But the look on your face says, don't let me go

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it go?
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?



[Verse 1]
It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away

[Pre-Chorus]
And how many times will I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?

But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Say it
Will you let it die or let it grow?

[Bridge]
You can tell me stop, if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it
But the look on your face says, don't let me go, no

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Scream it out!
Will you let it die or let it grow?

Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy

[Verse 1]
Weeks on end, I'm on the road
I start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times but I
I just sat next to my phone

[Pre-Chorus]
Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh

[Chorus]
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go

[Verse 2]
Thinking back to every night
That we just laid there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes
I never thought I'd say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh

[Chorus]
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go

[Bridge]
Just needed time to, to find my own
But I promise someone will give you all you want
Can give you all you need
And you just gotta see
I never meant to hurt you, no

[Chorus]
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm sorry, but I have to go


[Verse 1]
Please don't tell me that he's just a friend
Don't you touch me and act all innocent
'Cause when you're sitting on my bed
And you look at me like that
It's easy to forget
Please don't lie, we got too much to lose
And pretend he means nothing to you
And you could try to make it right
But it's not so black and white
Oh, I've got nothing left

[Chorus]
And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied

[Verse 2]
And does he love you like the way I did?
And was it worth it the night you spent with him?
How could you go and risk it all?
Blame it on the alcohol
Now you can save your breath
Oh, you can save your breath


[Chorus]
And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied

[Bridge]
It doesn't make it any better
When you say, "It's not my fault"
I really thought I knew you better
Guess I don't know you at all

[Chorus]
And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
Anywhere I could have followed you

Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would have followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You are the one that I want
And I'm saying goodbye

Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'll be the one if you want me too
Anywhere I could have followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me too
Anywhere I could have followed you
Say something I'm giving up on you

[Chorus]
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

[Verse 1]
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah

[Chorus]
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya


[Verse 2]
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la (La, la, la)
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't ya let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me, hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop

[Chorus]
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
(So damn hard to leave ya)
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la (True la-la)
Ooh, I should be runnin'

For ya
Ooh, I should be runnin'

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello]
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya

But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya


[Verse 2: Camila Cabello with Shawn Mendes]
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la (La, la, la)
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't ya let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me, hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop

[Chorus: Both, Camila Cabello & Shawn Mendes]
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita

[Verse 1]
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la

We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah

[Verse 1]
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
An early sunrise
Her tory slipped right through my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah

[Chorus]
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every time it's ooh-la-la-la

[Chorus: Cleymans]
Ik noemde jou die nacht mijn señorita
Toen na een glas of twee teveel tequilla
Ik zoiets had van oelalala oelalala
Maar toen je 's morgens wakker werd
Wist je niet meer wie ik was

[Verse 1: Van Geel, Both]
't was op vakantie en je weet hoe dat gaat
Je staat op een feest
En voor je't weet is 't al erg lalalaat
Is het al zo lalalaat, oh
Ik wil vertrekken
Maar aan de bar zie ik je staan
Een glas tequilla
Dus bied ik jou er nog één aan
Je zegt ja
Ik denk mijn haring die braad

[Chorus: Both]
Ik noemde jou diе nacht mijn señorita
Die na een glas of vier tеveel tequilla
Niet veel meer zei dan oelalala oelalala
Maar toen je 's morgens wakker werd wist je
Ik noemde jou die nacht mijn señorita
Die na een glas of zes teveel tequilla
Niet veel meer zei dan oelalala oelalala
Maar toen je 's morgens wakker werd
Wist je niet meer wie ik was

[Bridge: Cleymans, Van Geel, Both]
Je deed een voorstel
Mijn hersens zakten naar omlaag
Maar in het hotel
Bleek ik niet meer tot veel in staat ai ai ai
Ai ai ai
Ai ai ai
Zag dingen dubbel ongeduldig draaien om me heen
Ik heb die nacht geslapen naast 't wc
Dat laatste glas bleek echt mijn doodsteek

[Chorus: Both]
Ik noemde jou die nacht mijn señorita
Die na een fles of twee teveel tequilla
Iets met me deed als oelalala oelalala
Maar toen je 's morgens wakker werd wist je
Ik noemde jou die nacht mijn señorita
Die ja echt zeeën vol van die tequilla
Iets met me deed als oelalala oelalala
Maar toen je 's morgens wakker werd
Wist je niet meer wie ik was

[Outro: Both]
Deze kater die doet me zo zeer
Want ik zie jou waarschijnlijk nooit meer
Komt er ooit nog een volgende keer
Volgende keer
Volgende keer
Met jou
Met jou
Met jou
Want toen je 's morgens wakker werd
Wist je niet meer wie ik was

Me encanta que me digas señorita
Desearía fingir que no me necesitas
Cada caricia es ooh-la-la-la
Es tan real, la-la-la
Ooh, estoy corriendo
Ooh, me tienes yendo hacia ti

Ahora en Miami
El aire calienta mi piel
Sudor goteando
Antes de conocer su nombre la-la-la
Se sintió ooh la-la-la

La luz de luna
Bailamos horas en la arena
Con tequila
Sus manos en mi cuerpo están la-la-la
Se sintió ooh la-la-la

Me encanta que me digas señorita
Desearía fingir que no me necesitas
Cada caricia es ooh-la-la-la
Es tan real, la-la-la
Ooh, estoy corriendo
Ooh, me tienes


Amo que me digas señorita
Que mi alma muere y te necesita
Cada caricia es ooh-la-la-la
Es tan real, la-la
Ooh, estoy corriendo
Ooh, me tienes yendo hacia ti

Ahora en el hotel
Hay cosas que no cambiarán
Somos amigos
Pero los amigos no hacen oh, la-la-la

Porque sabes que ha pasado mucho tiempo no me dejes ir, ooh!

Oh, que tus labios besen con pasión
Oh, que no pares, amor

Me encanta que me digas señorita
Desearía fingir que no me necesitas
Cada caricia es ooh-la-la-la
Es tan real, la-la-la
Ooh, estoy corriendo
Ooh, me tienes

Amo que me digas señorita

Todo el tiempo he ido hacia a ti (por ti)
Solo espero que te importe a ti
Solo llámame y aquí estaré (yendo hacia ti)
Yendo hacia ti (solo hacia a ti)

Por ti (ella me ama cuando voy)
Por ti

Ooh, estoy corriendo
Ooh, me tienes yendo hacia a ti

[Interlude: Shawn Mendes]
"Hey, what's up, it's Shawn Mendes and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would
I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would (now I wish a nigga would)
Now I wish a nigga would

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Probably gon' shoot me if they see me
Now I'm on your TV, looking for a genie
Told him I was genius, I don't do bleeding
I need another season, they ain't seeing what I'm seeing, no?
You might never wan' be me, no?
Even when my skin greasy, no?
McDonalds would've been the more fire option
The barely famous shit is getting really fucking toxic
I used to wanna be Ali, I tried to be a boxer
Until you told me I could sing just like Mariah
And started—right?


[Outro]
Ooooh—stop

[Round 1: Odell Beckham Jr.]
It looks like I'm battling Harry Styles tonight
My bad, it's just all y'all white boys look alike
Your skin is so pale, just call it a hunch
You're so white, the only meal you eat is brunch
Got a song called "Mercy," and that's just wrong
Mercy would be if you could stop making these weak-ass songs
I hear you from Toronto, but you really a fake
'Cause the only star from the 6 is Drake

[Shawn Mendes]
Alright, Josh. Hit me, man

[Round 1: Shawn Mendes]
Yeah, you said that I'm fake, I think millions disagree
How'd they ever call you a Giant when you're shorter than me
Yeah, I saw your dance video, I know it went viral
Too bad you're not as good at catching Eli Manning's spirals
You brought up Drake, 'cause you lived in his house
But if he ever heard you rap, I'm sure he'd kick your ass out, man
And I'm a nice guy, and even I don't respect him
Let's be honest here, you're not even the most famous Beckham

[Round 2: Odell Beckham Jr.]
No matter what you say, my ego won't burst
'Cause whatever you've done, John Mayer did it first
With all of your songs, we know how it ends
A girl look you in your eyes saying, "Let's just be friends"
You're so soft, but I guess that's your charm
I'd give you a high-five, but I'd slap off your arm
I feel bad for homeboy, somebody come help him
So he can go back to his day job on TV as Young Sheldon


[Round 2: Shawn Mendes]
Yeah, you make fun of my records, and it seems a bit mean
Speaking of records, last season you were 3-13
A billion views on one video, and for that I'm thankful
I break the Internet, man, you just break your ankles
I'm actually confused by all of your disses
I tried to catch your references, but they were just misses
Your one-handed grab, that's what put you in the spotlight
But get ready to go home empty-handed tonight

[Round 3: Odell Beckham Jr.]
Shawn is definitely the most Caucasian human
He makes music for people who are allergic to gluten
A piece of bland chicken with a side of brown rice
You're like if Ed Sheeran was even more white
Bieber also came down here to make noise
I say "why the hell's Canada keep sending us these little boys?"
Tonight you got destroyed, you never had a chance
Now the only thing left is do my touchdown dance

[Round 3: Shawn Mendes]
Okay, okay, okay
Yeah, a dancing athlete, that's a little unusual
And it's the first time I saw that since High School Musical
You get fined for those moves that you think are the best
You should also be fined for how wack you dress, yeah
We don't even pay attention to football up north
Hockey has fights, man, yeah that's a real man's sport
Yeah, you called me "bland chicken," so that leaves you defenseless
When you have to go back and tell your teammates you lost to Shawn Mendes

[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey

[Verse 1]
Simmer down, simmer down
They say we’re too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don’t swim, you’ll drown
But don’t move, honey

[Chorus]
Because you look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you


[Chorus]
And you look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
I made a mixtape straight out of ‘94
I’ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
You can’t walk the streets at night
You're way too short to get on this ride
No I'm not, no I'm not, they're tryna tell me that I
I gotta be home when the street lights glow?
You can’t watch your TV show
I will watch what I wanna watch
No, I won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do

[Chorus]
And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

[Verse 2]
Watch me swim across this lake
Fly through the sky in my Superman cape
Watch me walk across this wire
Tip toe through the coals of a blazing fire
Watch me fly this kite in the rain
I’ll jump rope with my ball and chain
Come by and knock on my house of cards
If it falls I will build it from the start
I won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do


[Chorus]
And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

[Verse 3]
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don’t know what you heard about, listen to me yell it loud
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don’t know what you heard about, see that door I'll knock it down

[Chorus]
And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you


[Outro]
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
Do I need to show you? Guess I gotta show you



Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like
There's nothing left of me?

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet
You can take everything i have
You can break everything i am
Like im made of glass
Like im made of paper

Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper
Go, run, run, run
Im gonna stay right Here
Watch you disappear
Go, run, run, run
Yeah its a Long way down, but i am closer to the clouds up here
You can take everything i have
You can break everthing i am
Like im made of glass, like im made of paper
Oh, oh

Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
(Like a skyscraper)
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper


[Verse 1]
Hometown hero at the bar
Burned out high life super star
You know
Kept a buzz to fill the hole
Loved the lights and stole the show

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

[Chorus]
It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to know

[Post-Chorus]
Know, know
Know, know
Someone that I used to know


[Verse 2]
Rides the high that tears him down
Hates himself and loves the crowd
The king of fools, a heavy crown
He didn’t know he almost drowned

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

[Chorus]
It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to know

[Post-Chorus]
Know, know
Know, know

[Chorus]
It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to
Someone that I used to know
Know
Know, ooh


[Outro]
Know, know
Know, know

[Intro]
One, two, three, four...
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah

[Verse 1]
Play the lotto, you might win it
It's like 25 For life so you bust outta prison
Something's in the air, something's in the air
It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it
Take your last shot, you know you're gonna hit it
Something's in the air, something's in the air, woah

[Chorus]
Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big

[Verse 2]
It's like that feeling when you're about to win the medal
And you worked so hard, that you knew you wouldn't settle
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air
When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singing
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air, woah

[Chorus]
Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big

[Bridge]
Woah, yeah, yeah
If we stomp our feet, the ground will shake
If we clap our hands, the walls will break
Yell so loud, won't forget our names
'Cause something big is happening
Take this spark and start a fire
Raise this up, we're feeling higher
They can't tell us anything
Something big is happening

[Chorus]
Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big is happening, oh
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening, oh


[Verse 1]
I wake up a little drunk
Check my phone, I'm all alone
Ten missed calls, a couple texts
None of them are who I'm lookin' for
Who I'm lookin' for, yeah

[Chorus]
This is a song for no one
This is a song for no one

[Verse 2]
Get on a plane
Fly to the most beautiful place you've ever been
Close my eyes, things are better in my dreams
'Cause I'm with someone, someone I adore

[Chorus]
This is a song for no one
I wrote this song for no one

[Verse 3]
Yesterday, I got pretty drunk
Said some things that I shouldn't have
Told you that I really love you
You did not reciprocate those feelings
But that's okay, I'll be fine anyway
Ooh, yeah, hey, yeah


[Chorus]
I wrote this song for no one

Woo, woo, woo, woo
No, I wrote this song for no one

It's been a battle I can't win
Every time you get under my skin
I'm always saying that "I'm done"
But when I see you my heart still drums

I wish that I could know oh oh
Which way it's gonna go oh oh
Can we rewind this time
And get out of the shadows

Can we start this over
Start this over
Start this over
Can we start this over
Cause I don't like where it's going from here

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

We had a rough start
And fell apart
But you keep on stealing my heart
If it was meant to be
Then why do we keep running from our destiny

I wish that I could know oh oh
Which way it's gonna go oh oh
Can we just fall or stand tall
And get back to tomorrow


Can we start this over
Start this over
Start this over
Can we start this over
Cause I don't like where it's going from here

I don't wanna be
Shot down as your enemy
Baby we can be
In the world we used to know

I don't wanna be
Show down as your enemy
Baby we can be
In the world we used to know

Can we start this over
Start this over
Start this over
Can we start this over
Cause I don't like where it's going from here

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Can we start this over
Start this over
Start this over
Can we start this over
Cause I don't like where it's going from here

All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, Show me something

He said, If you dare, come a little closer

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take–it's given

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay


Ooh, ooh, ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, oh
To stay
To stay
To stay
I want you to stay

[Verse 1]
I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain

[Intro]
All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Met this girl when I was three years old
We were holding hands tight so I’m told
And it felt like an eternity
Said it felt like an eternity
Cause I knew back then we were more than friends
Two-sides of the story, it all depends
And I'll say it once and I'll say it again
It'll only end up hurting me
Years flew by, I was less than twelve
Long division, I need your help
Can you come on over and work with me?
Any time you like, I’ll make it work for me
Cause I knew back when if I get you close
When the times is right maybe I'll propose
Baby climb on up
Show me the ropes

[Chorus]
Darling, I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, mm yeah

[Verse 2]
So come on girl let me hold your hand, let's go get lost, leave without a plan
And I know you got the world to see, but you know you mean the world to me
And I know right now you got second thoughts
Do whatever it takes, pay whatever the cost, yeah
You know me, not the type of guy to sneak around, to do the time
But you must have me hypnotized
I'm d-d-d down to be by your side (yeah)
Every night

[Chorus]
Darling, I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings

[Bridge]
And baby when you fall down, I'll fall too
And if you get lost, then I'll get lost with you
And when the waves crash down
Then, baby, I won't move, cause I-I-I

[Chorus]
Need all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, oh yeah




Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

She's got her red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done her hair, real big beauty queen style
High heels off, feelin' allive

And, oh my god, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
If I die tonight, I'll be alright

And, oh my god, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness

Summertime sadness...

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness, yeah


I've lost my way
And day by day
Playing tough is hard enough
When the sun is out
Tougher in rain

Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Yeah when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)

And if I've lost my way (how am I still here)
Still standing straight (how am I still here)
I'm looking up to find I'm tough
When the sun goes down
And I feel the change


Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Yeah when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)
Sure of my self (self)

Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
And oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself (yeah)

'Cause when I was little I was so sure of myself

Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
When I was little I was so sure of myself (oh)

All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach

But I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away
The goose bumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste, yeah


These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
The holes of my sweater

[Verse 1]
Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the Southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think its a sin, yes

Well I heard mister Young sing about her
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow

[Hook]
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

[Verse 2]
In Birmingham they love the governor, (boo! boo! boo!)
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth

[Hook]


[Verse 3]
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how about you?

[Hook]

C'mon, Pop. Don't let it stop there

[Verse 1]
Ooh, your body's like an ocean
I'm devoted to explore you
Ooh, what do you desire?
I'm inspired, I'll do it for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you draw a map for me?
Laced with strawberries
And I'll get on my knees

[Chorus]
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you, and please you
Teach me how to love
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you, and please you
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love

[Verse 2]
Your imagination, now I'm fixated
And I'm dying to learn
Every inch of you, therе's something new
F'ing me up, I'm what you dеserve

Just draw a map for me
Laced with strawberries
And I'll get on my knees

White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries

And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries


And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe, mm-mm
Helps to make the seasons bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello & Both]
They know that (San—, san—), Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies for his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna try
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Chorus: Camila Cabello, Shawn Mendes]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Bridge: Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello]
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ooh, ah-ooh
Ah


[Chorus: Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello & Both]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase

Merry Christmas to you

[Verse 1]
I'm stuck inside this room, tryna play it cool while I'm looking for you
Tryna play it cool while I'm looking for you
I didn't wanna go, but I had to let you know that I'm falling for you
I needa let you know that I'm falling for you

[Pre-Chorus]
People everywhere, I'm pushing through this crowd
I'm sober, I don't even care
I hope when I walk upstairs that I won't be let down
I just want to see you standing there

[Chorus]
You're the only reason I came to this party
So, I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody
Everybody's wasted on their phones
I wanna find a place we can be alone
'Cause you're the only reason I come to this party
I came to this party

[Verse 2]
So, are you making moves? What you been up to?
It's killing me slowly
When all I wanna do Is get a second with you
The music's too loud, just wanna hear the sound of you singing softly
We can leave now, we got nothing to lose


[Pre-Chorus]
People everywhere, I'm pushing through this crowd
Until we walk right out of here

[Chorus]
You're the only reason I came to this party
So, I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody

[Verse 1]
I want to go back, forget that it's over
Paint it in black, when you left me alone
I never knew, she was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
And I can't go back to her anymore, no more

[Chorus]
You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No I can't lift the weight

[Verse 2]
Put you in the past, try to forget you cause it's over
And every time you ask I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head in the middle of the night
When I don't feel right, I dream I can hold you
And I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight

[Bridge]
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight

[Chorus 3]
You tell me you were happier with him but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight
You tell me you were happier with him, you want me to stay
You told me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back
You say someday you will change, but I don't wanna wait


[Prelude]
Hello everybody

Woah-oah-ooah, sing it out
Woah-oah-oahh yeah, sing it
Woah-oah-ooahh, scream it!

[Verse 1]
I want to go back, forget that it's over, yeah
Paint it in black, when you left me alone
I never knew, she was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
And I can't go back to her, no, anymore, no more
Sing it!

[Chorus]
You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away
All you guys!
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
I can't lift the weight, oh yeah


[Verse 2]
Put you in the past, try to forget you cause it's over
And every time you ask I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head, all you guys!
In the middle of the night, when I don't feel right
I dream I can hold you
And I can't go back to you, yeah, anymore, no more

[Chorus 2]
You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away
Sing!
But then you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, I can't lift the weight, yeah

[Bridge]
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't life the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't life the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't life the weight
Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't life the weight

[Chorus 3]
You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you
You push me away, but then you try to take it back
Say someday you might change, but I don't wanna wait


[Postlude]
I love you guys, thank you!



[Verse 1]
I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And 'am I the one you're dreaming of?'

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I’ve noticed
A little bit shining through the seams

[Chorus]
And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes

[Verse 2]
You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm tryna do
Well baby, I'm a fool for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I’ve noticed
A little bit shining through the seams

[Chorus]
And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way

[Bridge]
Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So come on, take my hand, we're moving on

[Chorus]
And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls, these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes


[Verse 1]
I'll pick you up at the same time
At the same place, the same old drive
We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight
We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight

[Chorus]
We're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words

[Verse 2]
We're still talking everyday
I'm running out of things to say to ya
What's really gonna break my heart
Is to have to tell your little brother
It might be easier to stay
But it'll never be the same, no, oh no
And if something doesn't change
Then we'll keep on sinking further


[Chorus]
Oh, we're going through the motions (yeah)
Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words

[Bridge]
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
I'm tired, I can't take it anymore
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
We're tired, we can't take it anymore

[Chorus]
We're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken, no
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first

[Prelude]
This is, uh, one of those really special songs
Something, uh, a song that showed me how important lyrics are when writing music
And how important talking about something that actually happened to you
And talking about something that is true to your heart makes a great song and that's why I love this
And I hope you do too, this is called Three Empty Words

[Verse 1]
I'll pick you up at the same time
At the same place, the same old drive

Thank you so much




I’ve been a Taylor Swift fan for as long as I can remember. But it wasn’t until I met and got to know her that I understood how wonderful a person she truly is.

Taylor makes the job of creating music for millions of people look easy. It all comes from her—her belief in magic and love, and her ability to be as honest and raw as possible. She’s the master of putting the perfect amount of thought into not overthinking, and that’s why her music connects so well.

I was so lucky to be able to open for a handful of her stadium shows on the 1989 World Tour. And I quickly learned that the magic of Taylor Swift doesn’t come from the lights, dancers or fireworks (although all of that is incredible) but from the electrifying connection that she has with the people who are there to see her. There’s an overwhelming feeling in the air. The feeling of your heart racing in your chest with ­excitement—so much so that by the time you get to “Love Story,” all you want to do is pick up your phone and text every person you know to say how much you love them. The feeling is so thick, you feel like you could reach out and grab it to keep forever.

Taylor makes anyone older feel young again and anyone young feel they can do anything. It’s so rare and so special. If there is one thing I want to achieve in my career and life, it’s that.


[Verse 1]
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off

In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead

Better than he can

Everything feels right
Since you came along

And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Could be everything I need and this could be so different
Now tell me what you want to do

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can, oh

[Bridge]
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
I promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
I promise I'll never let you down
Sing it for me

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you deserves a, scream it! gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can, baby
Better than he can

[Postlude]
Thank you


[Verse 1: Visible]
Never would of understood it
Never would of come to do it
If I had knew the sum of it
Id of done it sooner

I don't want no one else
I've waited for someone else
Now they losing their chance
Cause they ain't giving a damn

I just want you to know
You deserve the whole world
Cause your a trophy women girl
But he ain't the right for you tho

Stuck in a love triangle
And I know someone always gets hurt
Lord I hope it's just not me or her

Chorus

[Verse 2: Visible]
I see the way you look at him and I just want it
And its fucked up because I know he doesn’t
I hate myself, cause I convinced him to ask you out
Now i'm stuck, cause I’m the one left out
Now your key in a locked


Although, we FaceTime a lot
And we talk about anything
Never connected to anyone like we do any day
I'm the one you come to cry to

I just wonder if you feel like I do
You even said I wonder if he has someone, like I have you

Chorus

[Verse 3: Visible]
I know you love him, I know you care
I understand
But baby I'm a better man for you
Break my back and stand for you
We actually can have a conversation

What does he do?
It lit me on fire
When you said your crying
Cause you called
And he blew you off

That dick has some balls
But he's about to lose em all
Not tryna make you choose
But I wantchu


Right now I'm burning up
How dare him say he would give you up
Fuck em you'll be better off
Without him
Trust me look where it got him

Your posting things about him but he ain't do shit for you
I could love you like he could never do
Cause i'm just straight up better for you
He's an example of what I’d never be
Damn I want Jessie's girl
And it messes with me

Chorus

[Verse 4: Visible]
I don't the right move, I either lose him
Or I lose you

I'm just scared to mess things up because I have a heart
And it's been torn apart
But you're worth a new start

You’ve been there for me
That means a lot
Now imma do everything within my power to-keep-that-spot
And mirror it


Hopefully make it clearer for you to see
That all I want is for you is to be with me
Not him, he's flirting with other women
Why would you still be with him

At least I can spit rhythm
And have a serious moment
Cherish you, for you
Sounds good don’t it?

Not make fun of your country side
Making you live a lie
Lie with me, and see
I'll take you wherever in the world you wanna be



{ intro}
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop


{chorus}
I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

{chorus}
'Cause I know I can treat you better
Than he can

Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'

I know I can treat you better
Better than he can (can, oh)



{outro}
Better than he can
Better than he can




(Verse One)
I'm way across the coast awake in bed
And I wonder "If I spoke
would you hear what I said?"
So I take a breath and hope you can
A feeling deep inside that no one sees
But for no one to understand but you and me tonight
Tell me that you'll take this chance

(Chorus)
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best for you
Oh i'll try my best for you
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best for you

(Verse Two)
Hold your heart to keep you close
Wherever you want just spin the globe
But we can have the time of our lives right here at home
Just breathe
And follow me on down this road

(Chorus)
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best for you
Oh i'll try my best for you
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best for you

Oh i'll try my best for you




[Intro: Shawn Mendes]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge: Shawn Mendes]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da - that's okay

[Chorus: Teddy Geiger & Shawn Mendes]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes]
Day day dum mm hm
Da da oh, yeah
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days it never rains, but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Uh oh
Ee da de da de
Ee da de da de da de da

[Chorus: Teddy Geiger & Shawn Mendes]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high

[Bridge: Shawn Mendes & Teddy Geiger]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why—why—why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3: Shawn Mendes]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro: Teddy Geiger & Shawn Mendes & Both]
Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares us to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure, yeah
Under pressure, uh
Pressure




[Verse 1]
Am I asking all these questions for nothing?
I'm wondering if anyone's there, yeah
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared, yeah-eh-ehh

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand

[Verse 2]
I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody care-ares

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People gettin' off and on
I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand, yeah
Oh yeah-eh-ehh

[Bridge]
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, yeah-eh I know
Yeah we all get lost sometimes
But don't leave your heart behind, no yeah-eh
'Cause we all get lost sometimes
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-ehh-ehhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am

[Interlude]
When you wake up, your whole world's flipped
It's just different, and you gotta, you know you gotta, you gotta go with it
And, that's just simply growing up
And not see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it's been given to you
I mean, as much as times can be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
You're not going to feel out of place anymore
You're going to feel like that's where you meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go, and, and grow with it
And you can't hold on, to the old you, or the old this, or the old that
Because, you know, you change, and it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens in life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing, it never was
But at the end of the day, you know?
You're the same person
And, and where your heart is
That doesn't change

[Chorus]
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-eh-ehhhh-ehhh-ehhhhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am


[Verse 1]
I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can’t reach

[Chorus]
You know that I could use somebody
Yeah, you know that I could use somebody

[Verse 2]
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover on the street

[Chorus]
You know that I could use somebody
Yeah you know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you (Use somebody)

[Verse 3]
Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep, no
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah
I hope it’s gonna make you notice

[Chorus]
Someone like me (oh)
Someone like me (oh)
Someone like me (use somebody)
You know that I could use somebody


[Outro]
I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see



I've been roaming around
Always looking down and all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you
And all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover through the street

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you, oh
Someone like you, oh oh
Someone like you, oh oh oh, yeah
You know that I could use somebody

I won't lie to you
Now I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say that you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
So tell me what you want me to do

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better, sing
Better than he can
Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
I promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
I promise I'll never let you down
With me

('I know I can treat you better than he can)
(And any girl like you deserves a) scream it out (gentleman)
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can, no no no no no




You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
Because everything that don't make sense about me
Make sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You got to know you want it too
Because I want to wrap you up
Want to kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
Anyone can tell you you're pretty
You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty is deeper than the make up
And I want to show you what I see tonight
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
As good as you make me feel
I want to make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
And I just want to wrap you up
Want to kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
I want to make you feel wanted


[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom, for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day and the dark sacred night
And I just think to myself
Hmm, what a wonderful world, yeah

[Bridge: Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello]
Where the colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
They're really just saying, "I love you"

[Verse 3: Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello, Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello]
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh, I think to myself

[Outro: Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello]
What a wonderful world
It's still a wonderful world
All the pain that we've been through
All the fears and the hurt
I still think to myself
What a wonderful world



[Verse 1]
I know that I have made mistakes
Like when I introduced you as a friend
And I pray to God it's not too late
As I'm dreaming wide awake again
Yeah, we got so close I couldn't see
Laughing while we painted my room, yeah
And all along the joke's on me
Now you're happier with someone new

[Chorus]
What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me

[Verse 2]
When I call you late, I know he's there
But you still pick up and leave the bed
You speak low so he can't hear
And it gives me hope there's something left

[Chorus]
What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me

[Verse 3]
And when you ask me who I'm seeing now
I wanna say it's you I'm thinking about
I'm tryna find the words somehow
To say the things that I never said
I'd do whatever it takes, I need to know what'd you say
Cause you've got a hold on me, yeah, you got a hold of me

[Chorus]
What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me

[Verse 4]
I'm ready to tell you a story
I am somebody who loves you
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
And darling just listen don't worry
We could go down in history
Why don't you let your somebody be me?




[Verse 1]
Maybe I had too many drinks, but that's just what I needed
I hope that you don't think that what I'm saying sounds conceited
When I look across the room and you're staring right back at me
Like somebody told a joke and we're the only ones laughin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

[Chorus]
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'

[Verse 2]
What if my dad is right when he says that you're the one
No, I can't even argue, I won't even fight him on it
Call you when it's late and I know that you're in bed
'Cause I'm three hours back, seems like you're always six ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

[Chorus]
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah

[Bridge]
And if I have to, I'll wait forever
Say the word and I'll change my plans
Yeah, you know that we fit together
I know your heart like the back of my hand

[Chorus]
So baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', oh
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', I'm waitin'




[Verse 1]
You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

[Refrain]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
How do you, how do you just walk away?

[Verse 2]
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

[Refrain]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

[Bridge]
And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
You didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
Where were you in the morning?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?

Said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?

Look around and I don't see you

How do you, how do you just walk away, yeah?
How do you, how do you just walk away, yeah?

[Verse 2]
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this, baby

Look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waiting
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just?
Where were, where were you?
Where were, where were you?

[Bridge]
And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
I keep wondering why

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waiting
I said, where were you in the morning baby?


[Outro]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
Where were, where were you, yeah?
Oh, oh-yeah

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
Where were you in the morning, baby? (Baby?)
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin' (Waitin')
Where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
How do you, how do you just walk away? (Away)
How do you, how do you just walk away? (Walk away)

[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes]
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this


[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
How could you make me believe? (Believe)
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
Where were you in the morning, baby? (Baby)
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'

'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why (Why)

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
Didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning

Where were, where were you?

[Outro: Shawn Mendes]
How? Woo

My soul is overheated
You whisper, you whisper my name
I never did it in LA
Maybe we should do it again

[Verse 1]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know

[Pre-Chorus]
When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Verse 2]
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?


[Outro]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you



[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don’t mean nothing compared to her, and I know

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
I pretend that
I’m not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Verse 2: Leon Bridges]
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Leon Bridges]
Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I’m afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don’t know why I won't admit that you’re all I want

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Leon Bridges]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Leon Bridges]
I pretend that (Pretending like I’m not)
I'm not ready(I'm pretending like I mean)
Why do we put each other through hell? (Yeah, yeah)
Why can't we just get over ourselves? (Why, why, why)
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Outro: Shawn Mendes]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you




Haaa...

I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I forget about them
I wonder, I wonder

[Chorus]
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
Ohh, I wonder what it's like to be loved by

[Verse 2]
I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong and never said I was a saint

And tell me that the world will end up alright

[Intro]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
Pitter patter feet on this concrete
It's raining and the taxi cab won't wait for me
I'm a loner in my bottle and I'm lost at sea, whoa
People pushing fast, they must not see
See all the colors in world surrounding me
We are alone when we arrive and alone when we leave, oh whoa
Yeah

[Chorus]
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
It's funny that we thought the world was flat
Little did we know that it comes right back
And you end up where you started, in the place you're at, whoa
Soon as you think you got it sorted out in your head
You gotta let it go and here your heart is dead
Because believing is not seeing, it's just feeling, yeah, whoa


[Chorus]
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

[Bridge]
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel, yeah

[Chorus]
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel, yeah
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa



[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Waking up to headlines, filled with devastation again
My heart is broken, but I keep going

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes with Khalid]
Pain, but I won't let it turn into  hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away

Feeling hopeless, I need focus
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

[Verse 1: Khalid & Jessie Reyez]

I won't do it, I won't do it, mhm

It's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless, I need focus
You have died inside, and your soul's not worth the price
Don't you lose it for this foolishness, no
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no


[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes, Khalid & Jessie Reyez]
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

How come certain boys in blue
Can be so quick to shoot?
You gotta be the change that you want to see
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
You gotta be the heaven you want to see
No, I won't let it change me (Ohh)


[Chorus: Shawn Mendes, Khalid & Jessie Reyez, Shawn Mendes]
