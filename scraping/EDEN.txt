[Verse 1]
I can feel this dropping
Drunk drive and spoke to God
No fear, all that worry
And you're not moving but you want it to stop
Daydreamer, goals screenshotted
High speeds sank the sun
Gold dreams of California
So comfortable you need some trouble to cause

[Chorus]
But you don't know what you want
So I'll let go of control
'Cause I know just what you are
You're gonna break me in two, me

[Verse 2]
No falling back
I can feel this dropping
And when the wheels don't stop
Just, run me over
No dialing down now
Only realizing
We're too far forward now, oh

[Bridge]
Running out of fuel
I wanted you to hold back
Falling after something that ain't right, right
I don't feel right
Wanted you to know that you can't hold me


[Chorus]
You don't know what you want
So I'll let go of control
'Cause I know just what you are
You're gonna, you're going
You're going, you're going
Going, going

Boy, you're in a hurry
If you were lookin' at what I'm looking at, you'd be in a hurry too

Y'know how everyone's saying "seize the moment?"-
Can't you feel it?
-I dunno, I'm kinda thinking the moment seizes us



[Intro]
And you could lose yourself in this world, easy
I don't want to regret that
We never had a name for anxiety then, you said
Whatever it was made me, me
And on our bikes we used to take the shortcut through the graveyard
Now I see your father stood talking to you there for hours
And I haven't asked him how he's doing
I haven't visited 'cause I don't know what to say, honestly

[Verse 1]
Writing on a Monday morning
This week feels like a mountain
While I'm still trying to decide if its best to hide behind my eyelids
And it's cold
When you're gone you're cold
His weakness gives you strength
Not always for good
Drifting into hell
You think I can't see
It's over
Like my boy from the corner
Like mummies corolla
Like those nights in Paris
Rip them off these four walls like posters
Wonder if life is about staying true
While watching the sky change on you
Spread your wings or lose your inhibitions for a moment or two
You're floating
If we make it through this
We'll make it through anything
I spent too many night here, twisting and turning
In the corner of a corner
And when the truth capsizes
Will you blame the tide or the timing
She loves you regardless
You feel alone in the darkness
In the frame
And if the way forwards is backwards
Back down those country lanes
Back staring through that window pane
While the sun sets on all we made
The bigger picture's what we ran through
And chose to leave behind
Frustrating how the truth was the intention behind our divide

[Chorus]
'Cause she's got lots of love
And she's staring at you in the dark
She got lots of words that've been tearing you apart
Welcome to the end of the place you call home
Made hell for the highs, to try and fall through a moment
Your faithful eyes
I just want to trust like you do
Maybe I could stay there with you
The world looks so unkind from up here though
Hero

[Verse 2]
These hands are trembling
That word was heaven sent
I smashed this mirror
In one moment I reached for everything i'd ever felt
These conversations
Where we prioritise listening
Until our words are genuine and relevant
Still caught between two worlds
That raised me and framed my ambivalence
I still need that first line of space
Repeated by a stranger
I can't confide in those too close who treat help
As if it were a favour
He's outgrowing expectations and familiar faces
Witnessed you throw him to the waves
Just to try save him while he was drowning

I'm floating
If we make it through this
We'll make it through anything
I spent too many nights here twisting and turning
In the corner of a corner
And when the truth capsizes
Will you blame the tide or the timing
You love her, regardless
You feel alone in the darkness
In the frame
And if the way forwards is backwards
Back down those country lanes
Back staring through that window pane
While the sun sets on all we made
The bigger picture's what we ran through
And chose to leave behind
Frustrating how the truth was the intention was behind our divide

[Bridge]
I fell through
It feels like you
Everything
You, feel

[Chorus]
'Cause she's got lots of love
And she's staring at you in the dark
She got lots of words that've been tearing you apart
Welcome to the end of the place you call home
Made hell for the highs, to try and fall through a moment
Your faithful eyes
I just want to trust like you do
Maybe I could stay there with you
The world looks so unkind from up here though


[Verse 1]
She says I'm no good with my hands
But I'd hold up the whole sky for her
I want to forget my future and jump into the dark

[Verse 2]
I would've caused so much trouble
If I'd had you to sneak out with me
All our future's melted in your hands, they're drowning us

[Chorus]
Still I say things like, "No hindsight in 2020"
"Got my sight checked, that's precious to me"
"Can't blindside me, I'm well aware
If you were me, I'd burn this out
To the sound of the daylight slipping from me"
"All our yesterdays spent misguided, sliding'"
And now our heels worn down and self aware
With dreams of stopping

[Interlude]
You must have me messed up with somebody else
You got me mixed up
You got me stressed out
Youth spent plaited under walls, waterfalls
Walls can talk to things like
(Dreams of stopping, dreams of stopping)
(Dreams of)
You must have me messed up with somebody else
You got me mixed up
You got me stressed out
Youth spent plaited under walls, waterfalls
Walls can talk to things like


[Chorus]
Still I say things like, "No hindsight in 2020"
"Got my sight checked, that's precious to me"
"Can't blindside me, I'm well aware
If you were me, I'd burn this out
To the sound of the daylight slipping from me"
"All our yesterdays spent misguided, sliding"
And now our heels worn down and self aware
With dreams of stopping
With dreams of stoppi-
Dreams worth stopping for

[Outro]
You know, our progress is just really slow because we're trying to just find ways through

[Intro: EDEN]
Breathe deep, it ain't what you want
Next episode goes lights out
Gonna see these stars appear
Comin' up
Walkin' back I know it's not burnin'
My lungs collapsing
So what I got to fear
Now it's done

[Chorus: ATO]
The surface, I can see the surface from here
24 and checking off
The fuck I need a minute for?
My brother's back tonight though
Right, right, right, yeah
I was waiting for you right here
Yeah

[Verse 1: ATO]
Under this weight that you feel (I told you)
A shadow of guilt until you're ready to
(As the sun sets over us all)
Swallow this pill
I take too many and feel like it's nothing (Nothing)
I'm drowning in this water, supposed to make it fall easy
Keep going and you'll see me through the crowd
An Island we're all falling for something (Something)
You c-could have been mine (Mine)
Still looking for the past in the ... full of...
Say they've lived their best days, must be too afraid
I put a flower in the vase, hope it rains today
Looking at me like I'm nothing till that second keeps falling
My footsteps echo into your memory


[Chorus: ATO]
The surface, I can see the surface from here
24 and checking off
What the fuck I need a minute for?
My brother's back tonight though
Right, right, right, yeah
I was waiting for you right here
Yeah

[Verse 2: ATO]
Yo, I put this all in the open (Yeah)
Stand where you want to
I pay for the ceremony, I pay for that smile too (Yeah)
They're gonna like me, you know you're letting go now
You're gonna love me, you know I gotta go now
Tell him the truth, if he don't remember
(I said yo, for nothing)
I found my voice in this echo chamber
Fuck your help, I don't want no favours
Not now, we'll talk about it later
Claustrophobic zooming out, major
They ain't seen it like this when the lights fade in
Bad news coming in I couldn't take no time
My two worlds collide
The silence to sirens, the sirens to silence
You're in my city but it's just bad timing
There's a party tomorrow and you just might find it
Text me in the morning, say it just feels different
Too busy I missed it but we're good right? (Good right)
Promise I'll be thinking 'bout you all night
Change flight, stay or go, go or stay
This shit doesn't have no name
So if I see you in the future
We won't know what to say


[Chorus: ATO]
The surface, I can see the surface from here
24 and checking off
What the fuck I need a minute for?
My brother's back tonight though
Right, right, right, yeah
I was waiting for you right here

[Outro: ATO]
If I let reality set in now
I might have to drown in everything they offer me and Iie
I'm runnin' late, can you pick me up?
Pick me up

It's kind of like amazing that the project did have to be completed in New York
And that's sort of... it's like a very neat way of like a chapter closing I guess, or not closing, but you know, like something else beginning, but yeah for sure it's really amazing
Like to go from where you were to... a sort of emotion I guess to as sort of point where you can write about it and sing about it and sort of have a sort of have a sort of almost retrospective clarity
It's kind of... it's quite amazing lots of people, or most people will never ever have that

This series is called three-hundred and sixty-five times.
This video is called twenty.
So... Where do i begin?

I guess since this is the first time I've done this, I'll start with the basics.
You all know me as EDEN, and by the time you're watching this I will  be twenty years old.

It's funny how you don't realize how much things have changed until you've stopped to look back. I never had a euphoric moment where I thought "This is it. Everything is about to change.", no.. that doesn't happen, but still somehow, here i am three-hundred and sixty-five days later, wondering if a turning point even exists.

And, that's not to say nothing eventful has happened this year, either.
I dropped out of school, I released some music, and somehow that allowed me to travel a bit, even though I've never even played a show.
I made some new friends, and team EDEN now has more than one member, with the addition of my manager and lawyer back in Autumn.

So, what does that mean?
Am I gonna start making different music?
Absolutely not.
Is my manager gonna start posting or tweeting for me?
Absolutely not.
I mean, I started this on my own so that I could do what I want, how I want, when I want, and that's never gonna change. I own my future.
And, speaking of which, although I think this has been the most significant year of my life so far, 2015 has only scratched the surface of what I want to do.
I have more plans than you can imagine.

So, 2016....
Where do I begin?

It's been a long year. I guess most people of my 2016 has been defined by 2 things - My first ever piece of music for sale, and well, this.

['Sofie Letitre - I'll Be Fine (ZES Remix)' plays]

But really there was so much more to it than that.
I know you've probably read this in some fucking interview or something I've done or live streamed before, but like, I feel... for a long time I felt in the same place as End Credits, you know?
And so... I think you think too much of me is one way to get around that, but I really... You know, I just want to regress, I don't feel like I have - I'm halfway there but it's like 'shit I haven't really been doing anything for the last year.' And I've been saying I've been doing a shit ton but like, in terms of... I don't know.
The fall of last year I've been living in my fucking head 1000 miles in the sky not really 'in it' I guess. It's good to just get back down to earth. Wow that's really fucking... hipster or whatever, you know what I mean.
In terms of music though honestly it's been kind of hit and miss. I feel like I got a lot of cool shit I want to make and say, but it's - I don't think I'm in the right place right now.
Like I'm having cool ideas that I know and like a lot of shit that I want to achieve, and I mean like things I want to say but I don't think I'm in the right place right now. So I'm cool with just kicking it back and laying it easy. I just don't feel like it's connecting fully right now. I'm not even back for like 2 weeks and I was gone all in the last week and I'd be gone in London again in the next week, so I'm not really in the zone. Just gonna grow up a bit in the next month or two or four or five or whatever and it'll happen eventually. I don't know. Buuuuuuut I forget what else I was gonna say.


[start//end music video behind the scenes intro]
So, I can- are you recording?
Yeah
So, I can, wait for focus, and- *clap*
And now you can press play if you want
But I'm still putting it in
Yeah
You're dead wrong ('cause I feel like I need to crash)
It's kind of taking me back to like, ah, pick it up (what are we doing?)
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong
This will kinda take long, fuck, okay
And I got-

[Monologue]
Recently, in an interview, someone asked me, uh, "What are the three most important things that have happened to you this year?"
Um, I can't fully remember what I said, but, I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, um, "Finishing my album, moving to New York, and, the sh- the live shows I played."
Um, I've been thinking about that question for a while now, though, um, and that those three answers were maybe along the right lines, but, only like half-truths.
Um, finishing my album was important, but, for me, it was, you know, like, bigger than just the submission of some songs that I made in my bedroom.
Um, it's the bookend to a large part of my life, uh, you know-things have been on my mind in some cases probably for too long, um, and in the same way moving to New York was amazing, but, really, it was me jumping out of my comfort zone for a while.
Leaving the people and places and the culture that I had known my whole life behind, even, you know, just for a second.
Um, it wasn't really the live shows I played that were important, but more so, some of the things I learnt while out there.
Uh, I realized I wasn't taking myself into consideration; I was playing shows to please people and to entertain them, and forgot to make sure that I enjoyed it. Um, that I got to feel something more than, used afterwards. Um, and it was just a small shift of mindset but I'm so much better for it.
Um, it seems simple, but it took me a year and a half of touring to, to get it, and it only really happened at the very end of it.
But, most importantly, on tour, I saw another artist in a similar position. Um, I won't say who it was but I had finished performing and went to see someone much bigger than me.
And just before their set started, I saw them sitting down, uh, right beside the steps to their stage, you know, like, moments before one of the most energetic performances I saw this summer.
And they were sitting, hood up, and on their phone. You know, alone, uh, honestly looking quite down, or lost.
I didn't talk to them, but weirdly it was a relief knowing that it wasn't just me, um, that I wasn't the only one.
So I think I should tell you this. This album has been for me since I first started thinking about working on it, years ago.
Um, it just been a catalyst of change in so many ways for me, um, and it's taught me so much more about myself than I ever thought it would.
Um, I made vertigo by myself, for myself, um, but it, but it's finished now.
So, maybe it could be for you.
I have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly.

[Father]
I always wonder why birds choose to stay in
the same place when they could fly
anywhere on earth
- I then ask myself the same.

[Unknown]
i think it doesnt matter if youre aware of it
or not
how tidal everything seems
that one day you might stand on paradise
not move and soon be drowning

[Rosie Ashley]
or how some things you left behind
wait for you in your hotel room, some place
for latent change
to be reclimbed, reassembled
and unknotted

for me to say anything i must first have
listened
for you to find anything you have to look

[Unknown]
even in some small way
As above so below
the blue, the blue, and blue
Running, tripping, falling

[Florian Vasquez]
it was kind of like waking up from a dream
those lifelike episodes
you second guess yourself wondering
if any of it actually happened

[Fatme Bostandzhieva]
The last forever in third person
A chase cam rolling with the current
Pushed, moved,
and pulled out of view

[Mother, Ato Alexander]
and ive been thinking about a change of
pace
or the pace of change
or how the last few years were a singularity
you were the universe folding in on itself

[Ato Alexander]
information bleeds
no name
no location
no frame of reference
Running, tripping, falling
Just echos and a sense that something had
happened here

[Jonathon Ng]
unsure of what it was i turned around and
carried on

[Monologue]
I didn't really know what to say, um, so I thought I'd build a road, um
When I was like 12, I started making beats on my family computer
Um, by the time I was 15 I'd stolen it to my attic bedroom and I was, I was hooked
Um, I started putting the things I made online, that's The Eden Project, and just didn't stop
I never sent them anywhere, or even told my friends, but I just put them out there
Um, like, endless music for like three years and it just grew and grew
Um, I think I was luckily just in a cusp of a wave, really
Suddenly music could be produced by anyone with a computer and I just happened to be early
But suddenly, something crystallized, in winter of like 2014, and I knew I had something to say, and I knew what shape it was, finally
Um, so when End Credits was released in 2015 for free, a couple of interesting things started to happen
It was downloaded from my site about 15,000 times in a couple days
And I knew I had a fanbase, um, but, I'd never seen it in like a central number like that
It was spread across whatever uploads or songs, and, my first monthly payment, um, from having music on Spotify early that year was like 42 dollars and 62 cent
Which quickly grew into enough to support me, and a career of music, or at least an attempt of one
Um, and then suddenly after End Credits there's just more emails than I could handle, I had multiple meetings with various record labels, publishers, managers, lawyers, um, daily for about six weeks
Um, I was definitely in over my head but at least secure because I had money coming in, you know?
I could, I could say no
So I told everyone no, um, aside from my current manager and eventually the Astralwerks team, later, about a year later in 2016
I started, I started touring and everything just got bigger and bigger, I played to like 200 people for free in London, and then 450 paid tickets the same year
And I think, next time I played in London it was for 2,400 people
All three shows sold out really quickly, it was, I couldn't keep up with myself at all, basically
Um, I don't think I allowed myself to stop and enjoy anything, I was just hyper focused on going, you know, just forward
Going on tour, whatever, I was just moving, um
And in a weird way it was for the best and uhh, and for the worst, because, because of the work I put in I have a career, you know, doing what I love, which is one of the greatest things I could ever ask for
But, um, I definitely lost myself to it all, and I lost, I lost an [?] that I saw when I was 17
So, fast forward to 2019, I just, I spent as much time at home as I possibly could, um, I flew as little as I could, um
And it's still an ongoing process, I kinda just stripped all the things I built up away from underneath me to, to find the road, um, or at least try to
Um, I had some of the best times of my life this year, and some of the worst
Um, I said goodbye to a friend too soon
Um, I made some really difficult choices and, I, well I let myself cry about it which is, important, you know?
Um, now at the end of it all, um, I feel like I'm starting to see myself again, um
The present is a platform, build as you see fit, um
No plans, only godspeed
No future, only ideas
And we've made it this far

[Outro]
Ten tonne, ballast on my chest
As I woke up, a heavy inhale
For the nights-

[Verse 1]
So hold on if you want
I don't wanna play this, no
I don't have the patience
And last year was a long one
And these days are reruns
A fine time for a breakdown
Let's find words to tear these walls down
And I threw them all away
If I start then I probably won't stop
'Cause the world moves on and the lights stay on
For the next one, and next one, it's an ocean
No, I don't wanna waste forever
But I can if I want to
There's so much that can change my mind
So much of me has changed, how could I ever feel the same?

[Chorus]
So dive in, to my home
It's all I have, woah (Coming up for the weekend, running as far as we can)
So drive me, 'till the shore
Spoken like a real life savior
NASCAR, we're just racing in circles again
(We'll get it right for the next time)

[Verse 2]
Bleed out, it's a cold night
City views killed the starlight
Sleeping at the wheel for the first time
It's terrifying when you wake up
A few years later it's a new time
Hard to see how it stands from the inside
Inside, it's tried if it's tiring
You then, leave

[Chorus]
So dive in, to my home
(Cassini don't come home, you don't want to say it)
It's all I have, woah (And I don't want to know, but I feel it, I feel)
(Coming up for the weekend, running as far as we can)
So drive me, 'till the shore
(And I don't want to be here, but I don't want to go)
Spoken like a real life savior ('Cause I need it)
NASCAR, we're ju-

[Outro]
The lone and level sands stretch far away

[Intro: ATO & EDEN]
Three, four...
Back to serious voice

[Verse 1]
The frame ain't the same no more is it
I painted this picture and let the words reflect my image
Sometimes the truth hurts
Like the first line of this verse
I expected too much
Thinking they were just like me
I've got to start being selfish
Helping others left me helpless
When a river meets the stream
'Til the sky falls to its knees
And I could sit here for hours
This perspective
Trespassing thoughts
Behind locked doors
That belong to thrown away keys
You see
Needing me or need me not
Dictates your smile
Falling into lines like I ain't heard from you in a while
I'll be whoever you want
Providing you put your mind to it
Try'na buy my freedom
Should it afford my pride
I wish I could believe you
But I can't
There's too much on my plate
Pour me another glass
Drowning in these sorrows
'Till I found peace with my past
Drawn into a world where the flower is defined by the vase
And that's young me by the windowsill
With questions that view can't answer
Guess it's too early to say
If what we've made are mistakes
You just wanna
Lose your mind to find your soul
I just need to
See the world before I call this home
I used to run riot when I was young
Confused, try'na distinguish where someone like me belongs
When did I become the man
The cool kid, I was never that

[Chorus]
When they've learnt to love you for all but yourself
Your deluded wealth undermines your coming so far
Shattered glass
Family portrait suddenly finds the present
As we pick the past up
And recall it as heaven
It's never seemed so insignificant
Everything you worked for
Too precious to enjoy
Ourselves we avoid
These thoughts we employ
Too much noise
We just listen for the silence
That sits between the sirens

[Refrain]
And I just found a place that no-one else knows
Watch the sky reach 'til it lets go
I've never been afraid to close my eyes before
They'll paint you how they want to in the end
I knew that you'd show
Been caught up where you found me before
Wanna go
Somewhere only we would know

[Verse 2]
You said "I thought I told you to stop dreaming"
But your reality never gave me the reason
To stop believing
I chose the darkest path
To emancipate my own feelings
Clouding the vision
Distorting the meaning
I mean its clearer now than ever
Growing up under pressure
Nothing's ever promised
A slave for the word better
If you see me you don't know me
Stop pretending
You never attended
Not to mention
I was left to put to bed all of my questions

[Bridge]
But I'll sleep on it
Dream bigger
New frame of mind
The bigger picture
Fingers travel scriptures
'Till we capsize
I'ma keep running
We sinning
Pushed back to the beginning
The past speaking to me like a family 20 minute visit
Dreamt of this line last night
Stood at some height
Over the city, prepared to leave all these memories behind
Compromised by my desire to make it all on my own
You'll begin to sink in when you're stone
Yeah, we need a comparative perspective to be free
Happy despite all that you haven't seen
Scared to look for answers
'Cause you know what they might be
94 Dreaming
Still looking for a mirror that I believe in

[Refrain]
And I just found a place that no-one else knows
Watch the sky reach 'till it lets go
I've never been afraid to close my eyes before
They'll paint you how they want to in the end
I knew that you'd show
I've been caught up where you found me before
Wanna go
Somewhere only we could know

[Chorus]
When they've learnt to love you for all but yourself
Your deluded wealth undermines your coming so far
Shattered glass
Family portraits suddenly finds the present
As we pick the past up
And recall it as heaven
It's never seemed so insignificant
Everything you worked for
Too precious to enjoy
Ourselves we avoid
These thoughts we employ
Too much noise
We just listen for the silence
That sits between the sirens

[Verse]
I ran away last night, in my dreams
Oh, my dreams, they keeping me awake, yeah
Came crashing through the rain
Half light on a turnpike
One-forty make those guard rails float nice
I couldn't float right
Show me the way
To slow down, down, yeah
Slow down, down, down
Slow down, down
Slow, slow down

[Outro]
I found a way last night, in my dreams
Oh, my dreams, they keeping me awake, yeah
Came crashing through the rain
Half light on a turnpike
One-forty make those guard rails float nice
Learning to float right
Loving the wave
Loving the wave
Loving the-


Sex, drugs, and rock & roll
Is all I want
Something more than superficial
Is all I want
The sound of the words you know
Is all I want
Sex, drugs, and rock & roll
Is all I want

Whoa-oa


[Intro]
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Ooo, oh
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Verse 1]
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy, ooo

[Verse 2]
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
(Nothing you can't...)
There's no one you can save that can't be saved
(Saved...)
There's nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you
It's easy, yeah

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love, love
Love is all you need

[Outro]
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
Love is all you need
Love is all I need
Love is all I need
Love is all I need


[Verse 1]
And just one moment
Is all I ask for
Just one talk between us
And just one second now
Some perfect clarity
And eighty hours alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore to god that I wouldn't cry
And I swore to you I can't see
How it's anything more than a lie

[Chorus]
And all these years
I won't ever let them go
All my fears
They'll bring me down, down so low
And I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn to dust

[Verse 2]
So I'll get on fine
My mind turned inside out
I've always found it easy
To hide these thoughts of mine
A collapsing state of mind
I'll sink to where thoughts can't find me


[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore to god that I wouldn't cry
And I swore to you I can't see
How it's anything more than a lie

[Chorus]
And all these years
I won't ever let them go
All my fears
They'll bring me down, down so low
And I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn, to turn

[Verse 3]
And we all hurt
And time heals nothing at all
Decisions made and they cut me off
From all I've ever known
And I can't think
No, I can't breathe
I can't be what I want to with this weight on me

[Bridge]
I wish I had
Selective amnesia
To keep you away from me


[Chorus]
But I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn to dust



[Verse 1]
And this is just another sad song
I can't deny that I've been needing one
And that the world is always at fault
And we did nothing, how did we do wrong?
And I've been thinking that when we thought
The world would break us that we weren't wrong
But it's just never been the world outside
And sonder kinda has me terrified

[Verse 2]
And I'm so sorry I can't find the time
Spent all my days over-preoccupied
And I've been thinkin' 'bout how I'd react
If you were me and I was ghosted out
And I know I should try more
But I've been so caught in my own small shit that I can't see
Past the nothing around me here

[Outro]
But I've been trying really fuckin' hard not to try so hard
Really fuckin' hard to just let go
Really fuckin' hard not to try so hard
And realize I've nowhere left to go


[Verse 1]
But she was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Oh mama, what do you mean I am the one?"
She said I am the one
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Go and dance on the floor in the round
(I don't even know if I can tell you)

[Pre-Chorus]
And the people always told me, be careful what you do
And don't you go round breaking young girls' hearts
My mother always told me, be careful who you love
And be careful what you do because a lie becomes a truth

[Chorus]
And Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
So take my strong advice
(Don't think twice) Don't think twice
She told me, "Baby, we'd danced 'till three"
Then she looked at me
She showed me a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
Go and dance on the floor in the round


[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, be careful what you do
And don't you go around breaking young girls' hearts
But she came and stood right by me
And she smelled of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she brought me to her room, yeah

[Chorus]
And Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
But the kid is not my son
(Son)
She says I am the one



[Intro]
Yeah but do you think it matters what people think?
I don't bother caring about what people think

[Chorus : EDEN & ATO]
Running round the city
Running through my thoughts (Change my memory)
Rolling in the deep end
Finding all we've lost (You told me that it would be)
Holding on so fleeting
Falling in the dark (I don't even feel that way)
Blocks holding up the ceiling (Should catch up)
Blue lights far below
Blue lights far below (Do you remember?)
Blue lights far- (Do you remember what it- Remember what it was like? He should)

[Verse 1 : ATO]
Just poured my head and my mask in
You see the light, you're the darkness
Light up the city, I left the bedside on
Still darkness giving my light wings
We opposite sides of the same thing
Blue, white red and it's waving
Da ta ta tay take, till it hits right
All turns white then it's back to black

Can't keep all these thoughts in head
Made me think twice, I can't forget
Made me think twice, ah wipe the sweat
It's all ahead

Influence slips off my open mind
The Waterfall
Puddle at my feet
Keep walking
The fading frame to the coffee clubbing, meet n greets

Word, Old shadows are tall
Man lost his life his boy lost more
Scar to the dome
Foot to the floor
In this life ain't shit to wait for
I could have sworn I seen him before
You from round here?
You sure are you sure
Zoom out a moment
Through heaven and more
Tell that kid run
Till he can't no more
I ain't looked back for 10 years that's us
Fuck their wall all made of glass
Keep going forward, outrunning the past
Past your moment past your chance
Odds stacked against
My voice stretch far
X marked the spot
Rip it apart
This is England
We can't see jack
What you saying
You think you're all that

[Chorus : EDEN & ATO]
Running 'round the city (So many [?])
Running through my thoughts (Sometime)
Rolling in the deep end (So much going on)
Finding all we've lost ([?] goin' somewhere)
Holding on so fleeting (Wish it just)
Falling in the dark (Go away)
Blocks holding up the ceiling (Figure out shit)
Blue lights far below ([?] perspective)
Blue lights far below
Blue lights far-

[Verse 2 : ATO]
Yo (D'ya forget?)
I saw the breakthrough before I heard it
Hell surrounds these churches
Poverty, preys it's lurking
Mothers pray for the youngest, cry for the oldest
The moment's gone, try hold it
But there ain't no mercy
Life moves on, the rents 850
Run for the train, why the fuck it leave early?
Have to order this cab back to Burley
My Boy said he's short
I spotted him 30
Mum's calling
I'll call you in 30
Shit, I hope that the test came back fine
Rain taps on the side of the cab
Driver keeps making eye contact
Yo, just drop me at the lay
Hold that change
It's pissing it down now
This feeling again
Watch the panic set in
Sweaty palms
Caught in a daze
I can't explain
Ain't felt this in months
Phone going off in my pocket like a siren
Almost at the flat, where my keys, I can't find em
Tight jaw, feeling it tighten
Don't look down boy, boy keep climbing
Four walls deep black and they're rising
Devil's whispers, reminders
Of everything you've been hiding
Or just can't face
Move past faces
Running still sideways
Took the stairs
Can't find the breaks
Imagine they saw me like this
Third time I feel the keys in my pocket must have missed before
Hand up to the door
Shaking more
Open it, slam it
Slowly drop to the-

[Chorus : EDEN]
Running 'round the city
Running through my thoughts
Rolling in the deep end
Finding all we've lost
Holding on so fleeting
Falling in the dark
Blocks holding up the ceiling
Blue lights far below
Blue lights far below
Blue lights far-

[Outro]
I'm fine
Yeah it was a good day, it's good

[Verse]
Runnin' on empty
I waited years in a past life
Runnin' out of rope and the waters high
I drowned for you and I didn't regret it
Text me back in the afterlife
Needed the time didn't realise
I had it all along, can't take my own advice
Conflated, fillin' the gaps for love

[Chorus]
And it's obvious
That I'm caved in and breaking up
But I know it's gone
I know it's gone
But what's over now
In my dreams you call me back
But I hope you don't
I hope you don't

[Verse]
I hope you're gone off to better days
I been watching the time, how it erodes away
Thinkin' 'bout how the last years feel like yesterday
How did I lose grip on it
Honest
Been fallin' through nightmares, light years away
And doin' my best to keep those thoughts at bay
Finding my highlights are the loudest places
And strangers faces
Getting caught up in a race of it
And walking through the clearing ground
If we took our chances
And we exchanged glances, yeah
Call it in a moment
And walking down the road that I grew up on
And fallin' out of habits
Stop pleading for empathy

[Chorus]
(?) it's obvious
That I'm caved in and breaking up
But I know it's gone
I know it's gone
But what's over now
In my dreams you call me back
But I hope you don't
I hope you don't

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I don't need you to tell me
I don't need you to tell me
'Cause I
I don't need you to tell me
No I don't need you to tell me

[Verse]
It's okay I'm going
I'm searching
For what I am now
I'll find you if it's urgent
Or if I'm hurtin'
More than I am now
And we'll come back here some day
And laugh about it
Memories that don't recall
How it felt like I was burnin'
While you weren't watchin'
Took everything I loved
No nowhere feels like home
Home
No nowhere feels like home
Home
No nowhere feels like home
Home

[Verse]
Reflections
Of my dash aligning stars over shoulder
Inflections
Tell me you don't really mean what you say
That you were in love, love, love
(I don't want it, baby, I keep falling)
You're screaming and bursting heads
Breathing corrupted air (Tell me I'm back at it since)
Your cigarette's going out, dear
(Help me down, I can't sleep)
Mayfair and lip fillers
Heartbreak and coke dealers
You were in love, love, love (It's cold feet)
But since you're on your way out
Living fast, I capsize amazed now
Leave a message when you go
(You leaving, leave me out, me out)
I, I had a dream that you wanted me
I still see you with my eyes closed
I don't think you understand how brilliant you burned
Does your past feel complete now I'm here?
Versions of another version you've seen
When I calm down
I'll be long gone

[Outro]
Just stop

[Verse]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
Falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows (Like a river flows)
Surely to the sea (Surely to the sea)
Darling, so it goes
Some things are made to be

[Verse]
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you
For I can't help
Falling in love with you

[Verse 1]
Of course I'm scared
Would I be thinking straight if I wasn't?
Of course I'm scared sometimes
Even if I say it don't phase me
Or if I say I'm not hazy
But drowning ain't so bad
'Cause at least you know where you're going
And we're all future bound
So I guess that's really the same thing

[Chorus]
But I always liked the thought of maybe being a runaway
I could be your lover and you could be my heartache
I could sing the songs that we used to sing when we were kids
Maybe that could bring us back to before we got stuck in that place

[Verse 2]
I want to be like John Dillinger
Just try and catch me if you can
And we could drive off in the sunset
Even if it's not the plan
'Cause plans are overrated
'Cause you never really know where you're going
And the past is always changing
Ain't been gold since I remembered it that way

[Chorus]
But I always liked the thought of maybe being a runaway
I could be your lover and you could be my heartache
And I could sing the songs that we used to sing way back when
The future wasn't everything and we lived because we loved it then
Oh, I'm going back
Catch me if you can


She says I'm distant
But I can't be present here
Complacency is your currency I can't afford
If dreaming is greater than its fruition
We can all live to dream of what may or may never happen

[Verse 1]
And if I told you how this story ends
Would you change a step you take?
And if I could relive all of my days
I'd live them all the same
'Cause I'm scared
Of all that I don't know
'Cause I want it all, but all of it ain't gold
And I'm scared
But I know it's not for long
'Cause I'm learning what I should've long before

[Chorus]
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Is time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight
A lifetime in repeat

[Verse 2]
But I still find solace
When you say
That you know how I feel
When it's wrong
And we ain't been right for years
And let go
Give these ghosts a new home
And let's bury our past and our fears and all these bones
And let's go
I should've seen it long before
'Cause this is my life
I will not run in circles
Ending where I start

[Bridge]
So hold on to me
We'll burn out slowly
And feel our hearts leap
To words we don't mean

[Verse 3]
Love
Means nothing to me
'Cause I don't know what it is
I'm just dying to be
All that I've been dreaming of
And words betray me
Contradict all I stand for
But I'm still learning
Yeah, I'm still learning

[Chorus]
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Just time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight
We're falling to our knees

[Verse 1]
Talking intentions over actions
Brothers trust me with a passion
Unafraid to tell them the truth
Whatever the repercussions
I'm living for clarity
I've been way too close to the edge
To live for a salary
Walk the past like a gallery
Mothers calling my phone
This bout to be a long call
Get to asking me about women, I can no longer vouch for
Thoughts on my mind
Let em sink in the wine
I'm tryna be transparent
You can't negotiate with time
I'ma be here for you
That's a good enough excuse
For me to embrace the chaos
That falls below the blue
Still love me for my flaws
I fell through yours
Found each other in each other
I'm afraid to give you more
Unsure what I believe in
I needed a way to let go of all of my Demons
Pursuing love
But still ain't found someone to give me reason
To give this up
I'd never settle for less than the feeling
I'm dreaming of

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma keep it the way I wrote it
Only authentic
These questions are cliff hangers
I'll have to close my eyes
They listen, they know it's real
They know how I feel
Sometimes I float in the ink
Until these words sink
Anxieties that I had
Made me the stronger man
Looking in your eyes
Like a galaxy I understand
The devil's tryna tempt me
But my fathers got a bigger plan
Walking back through your footsteps
To the motherland

[Chorus]
Coz when I feel the first raindrop
I'ma look up, and don't fade away
And I heard you don't believe
In the things you used to say to me
Coz when I feel the first raindrop
I'ma look up, and don't fade away
And I heard you don't believe
In the things you used to say to me

[Verse 2]
My feet dangle over my comfort zone
All these rappers clones
Hard to see their heart through the facade they feel obliged to show
Spend some time up
Then I'm low
Let the feelings go
She just wanna rush
I move slow
So I'm not involved
Sometimes I'm off then I'm on
But my brothers stay
Sometimes I sin
Follow faith
But I always pray
Live like anything can happen, nothing is taken for granted
Don't mean I won't take a risk
But won't pick apples in this garden
Brothers want it for themselves
But it's bigger than me
I'll be living for you
15 consecutive weeks
Turning pages that question what you know I'm destined to be
And then I'm back on the music
Bars ruthless
Straight truth
I'll draw anyone out when I paint my past in the booth
Why are they acting, like I don't read between lines for a living
I could see the snake in you when it was smiles and finger clicking
My brothers know it's real
Judge a friend by how they moved in the past
Intentions glow in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma keep it the way I wrote it
Only authentic
These questions are cliff hangers
I'll have to close my eyes
They listen, they know it's real
They know how I feel
Sometimes I float in the ink
Until these words sink
Anxieties that I had
Made me the stronger man
Looking in your eyes
Like a galaxy I understand
The devil's tryna tempt me
But my fathers got a bigger plan
Walking back through your footsteps
To the motherland

[Chorus]
Coz when I feel the first raindrop
I'ma look up, and don't fade away
And I heard you don't believe
In the things you used to say to me
Coz when I feel the first raindrop
I'ma look up, and don't fade away
And I heard you don't believe
In the things you used to say to me

Fuck..

[Verse 1]
Faded along the way
It can't all be on the wave
Though I'm falling now, don't take what you don't need
Belated by-the-ways
Is too late the price I pay?
Though it's over now, don't say what you don't mean

[Chorus]
Tangled in the back seat
Melting through the taxi
Cali is bending around me (Yeah)
What was it you said?
Feels hollow and I can't speak
Always been about me
Can't lie to you, I've cold feet
Waiting on kairos now

[Bridge]
'Cause I can only see so far
Staying awake like it's a lost cause
And I don't feel the least bit tired
Talking to you
You said this ain't you, but being straight, I got

[Verse 2]
Infatuated along the way
It can't all be on the wave
Though I'm falling now, don't take what you don't need (Yeah)
Belated by-the-ways
Is too late the price I pay?
Though it's over now, don't say what you don't mean

[Chorus]
Still, we were tangled in the back seat
Melting through the taxi
Cali was bending around me
What was it you said?
Pressure when you can't see
Only think about me
Can't lie to you, I've cold feet
Where does that leave us now?

[Intro]
It's been a few years since you been gone
There's been a few tears, but that was years and years ago
Yeah, I grew up to be exactly what you wanted
Yeah, I've been living out the dream that you dreamt up
It's been a few years with more to come
It's been a few years since I've felt sure of what I want
And I woke up today and found that you were waiting here for me and I thought
Woah, old friend, it's bittersweet
But how could you do this to me?
How could you do this to me?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
'Cause you are not who you think you are
There's no grain on these brown eyes
But they can be green if they really want
And I can bend your words
So they say exactly what hurts the most
But silence is better than fake laughs or faking we're always up
Loose grip
The world bends around you
And living through cracked screens
We fold down to what we want
Out of love
We talk through lines, we're made of smoke
And just in time, we drift away
Diffusing light, confusing times
Growing up, or cascading down?
Cascading down
I'm hurting now

[Verse 2]
But change comes slow
If you hate what's in your head, the fuck would you speak your mind?
In search of lost time
Just 21, so I'm young and I'm stupid
Only 16, yeah, I think you should've known
I think you fucked me up
I think, I think you fucked me up
And I've got nothing to say to you

[Outro]
It's been a few years and I moved on
Couldn't make it disappear, oh I tried so hard to be strong
But I grew up today and faced that I'm not just lonely
Don't feel much better but I guess that it's a start




[Intro]
So tell me what it is that you want, that-, that you don't have

[Verse 1]
Contemplating everything
I'm questioning who I am and these walls I'm living in
I might scream but they won't hear this hurricane
That's some love I mix with pain
That's some shit won't be the same
That's some rain that comforts me on these walks I take outside the frame
Yeah, yeah
I'm so used to the cycle
I don't really tell nobody
I'm close to the edge and I might fall
Running from something years ago
I don't even know how to slow down
I'm anticipating a crossroads
And I'm asking God where to turn now
It's three in the morning
And I do this every day
My thoughts get lost in this dark room
'Til the sunrise washes them all away
I heard there's beauty in the struggle
I heard it's sweet, it's subtle
Light pours down this tunnel
Run until I lose my shadow
I may just trip on some faith in here
Thought I was running for light
But in truth, I was running in fear
This was never how it used to be
I loved you before I learned to love me
I tried to confide in friends but they taught me that that was naive
Taught me to cover my sleeves and fall on my knees
And to look up in the sky in need

[Refrain]
Run, run, run
I'm trying to find me, yeah
Made it to the river edge
Trying to find some peace, yeah
Watching a black sky
Turn into a butterfly
Fly, fly, fly away
Letting go of yesterday
And I ain't never seen it like this
Never seen it like this before
And God, if I changed my mind, I would never see this I'm sure
I ain't never seen it like this
Never seen it like this before
God if I changed my mind, if I changed my mind, I would never see this I'm sure

[Verse 2]
We visit in a derelict past
Wiping the dust off this glass
This mirror shows me at nine years old
Looking back at me so hard
Where've you been?
Why'd you leave me behind?
I've been shouting for you all night
I've been calling 'til the sunrise washes me from the back of your mind, oh
Yeah
And I thought you would never come
Thought you would never be here
Looking in this broken mirror, everything's so clear
I didn't think I'd find you either
Not sure what I was searching for
Wiping the mirror with the tears I've been holding for years
Then it turned into a window when we watched it pour
When I'm old I wanna be somewhere real
You told me when I'm old I wanna be someone real
I don't really wanna end up like you
I just wanna find somebody that feels like me
Feeling to sail away
I'm gon' find me a better place
Somewhere they see me before they see my race
Somewhere I don't need to hide away
These friends aren't friends 'til they shared your hardest days
Your hardest time, your coldest place
You can come if you want to
You can come if you want to
We can still be okay
I got nothing but some thoughts on you
Watched it rain
But if I run 'round, take it all on, be a good son
Would it be alright?
Would it be alright?
Be alright, yeah
And lately I don't know what to do
I got nothing but some thoughts on you
But if I run 'round, take it all on, be a good son
Would it be alright?
Would it be alright?
Would it be alright?

[Refrain]
Run, run, run
Trying to find me
Made it to the river edge
Trying to find some peace
Watching a black sky
Turn into a butterfly
Fly, fly, fly away
Letting go of yesterday
And I ain't never seen it like this
Never seen it like this before
God, if I changed my mind, I would never see this I'm sure
I ain't never seen it like this
Never seen it like this before
God if I changed my mind, if I changed my mind, I would never see this I'm sure

[Outro]
"So tell me what it is that you want, that-, that you don't have"
"Well I'd like to be, I'd like to be more consistently here, you know? I'd like to really get on a ro-...
I'd like to just, and I know it's not probably ever, maybe, possible but
Because it's so improbable, and so impossible, I'd just like to really see how long I could last as being really here, you know?
Really in it, really alive in the moment, you know?"


Aight-
Yeah, what was that gonna-
Ooh aah hey

[Chorus]
I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
What the fuck, babe?
I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
What the- huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
All dipped in Prada
Lookin' for a problem
Sorry baby pardon me
You just took a part of me
When you gon' apologise
You be lookin' so bad
It be makin' me so mad
This is not for me ever since

[Chorus]
I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
What the fuck, babe?
I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful


[Verse 2]
Oh
Cha- cha- change you change for me
Look at all this damage you take from me
Even all this hurt you take from me
I don't recall the last time you said that I
Fucked up for real
Got you like I got your bills
I'm the one that changed the rules
And you ain't ever been the same ever since I

[Chorus]
I left you alone, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' ungrateful
What the hell, babe?
I left you alone, no, no, no (Yeah)
Huh, yeah, [?]
Oh, I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
What the f---, babe?

[Outro]
I left you alone, no, no, no
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful
Why you bein' disloyal
Why you bein' unfaithful

[Instrumental]


[Intro]
Do you still think of it?
Find some peace inside your bed
You were sleeping on my shoulder like you don't know
Got no case, let my phone crack
'Cause some things aren't built to last
So how long 'til I can stop dreaming about you now

[Chorus]
'Cause it was a fear
Something that I said and can't take back
We laid in the night air and talked it down
But it was fading
Maybe we're two keen
Loving it arcane, no holding back
If you could be here now when you turn back
And tell me something
So tell me something

[Bridge]
I'll keep you safe in my mind until it's gone
Maybe it changed with the time
And you don't feel it out though
Yet you said you'd call
But I told you I would be coming back soon
Now I don't
Now I don't know

[Verse]
But I still think of it
You skipped work and we stayed in
And I was thinking maybe something was happening
We watched the light die from your terrace
You told me 'bout your ex
A crush you had for years and
The life you used to hate
You asked how this would end
But we'd only just met
I can't stop thinking about it now

[Chorus]
'Cause it was a fear
Something that I said and can't take back
We laid in the night air and talked it down
But it was fading
Maybe we're two keen, yeah
Just loving it arcane, no holding back
If you could be here now I'd pull you back
And ask you something
Ask you something

[Outro]
Do you still think of it?
'Cause I see echoes of how it felt
That you were sleeping on my shoulder that you don't know
But no case to hit you back
'Cause some things aren't built to last
So how long 'til I can stop dreaming about you now


[Verse]
Why do me like that?
No, you can't take it back
I meant what we attract
Can't lie, it's facts

[Chorus]
I'm dreaming of the past
Chances, they've passed
Moulded your own cast
Emotions, high contrast

[Bridge]
Dreaming of the past
(Dreaming of the past, of the past)
Dreaming of the past
(Dreaming of the past, of the past)

[Verse]
Why do me like that?
No, you can't take it back
I meant what we attract
Can't lie, it's facts

[Chorus]
I'm dreaming of the past
Chances, they've passed
Moulded your own cast
Emotions, high contrast

[Verse 1]
'Cause I had the best of the worst sides
And I had these lungs, ohh
And I had too many flashbacks
That I just let them burn

[Pre-Chorus]
'Till my chest is on fire
And my head just won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like it's move or slowly die
You say, "You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you and you know it"
But ain't that just the point?

[Interlude]
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm so caught below, and I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
Whatever you wanted
But not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I wanted
Or maybe I need it
Swear lying's the only rush I need


[Verse 2]
'Cause all I needed was some words to say
That all these feelings don't mean shit to me
'Cause it's all just chemicals anyway, anyway, yeah
And I got way too many routes to take
To make this all just go away
And find another heart to break
So heartless with these words I say
Just saying what I'm supposed to say
'Cause I had nothing for you
I can't love when I can't even love myself
Things I would rather be thoughts at the back of my head
But I'm addicted to hurting
And I got these lungs
And I spent too many late nights
Just thinking a hole in the earth

[Pre-Chorus]
'Till the sky is on fire
And my head still won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like I need something to come alive
She said, "You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you, what you doing?"
And I said, "That's the point"


[Interlude]
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm so caught below, and I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
Whatever you wanted, but not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
'Cause I'm a fucking mess inside
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I want it
Or maybe I need it
Swear lying's the only rush I need

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh yeah, I need it
Yeah, I need it, I need it I need it, I need it, yeah

[Intro]
I dunno, I just remember it being so much brighter I guess

[Verse 1: EDEN]
Cigarette ash like wildfire
Burning holes in the nighttime
Open scars feel like barbed wire
White lies flying high like a ceasefire
Dropping flags on the shoreline
This is as far as I can feel right
'Cause what you don't know
Can haunt you

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN & Leah Kelly]
And all we ever wanted
Was sunlight and honesty
Highlights to wanna repeat
Let's get away from here and
Live like the movies do
I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think for a while

[Interlude]
(Don't drag it out, living like that doesn't mean a thing)

[Chorus: EDEN & Leah Kelly]
So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause happy endings hardest to fake
Yeah


[Verse 2: EDEN & Leah Kelly & Both]
Sunsets on power lines
Making a break for the other side
Heading out to where that sunshine
45 millimeter rolling like we lost time
Polaroids and OutKast
Rather burnout young than grow up fast
And we could be forever future bound
'Cause all I need is time and now
And I could leave this past behind me
(And all we ever wanted was)
And maybe I'll see a way for me to stay
(Sunshine and honesty highlights)
When there's so much out there
(To wanna repeat let's get away from here and)
So I'll live forgetting for the time being
(Live like the movies do)
And I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think for a while

[Chorus: EDEN & Leah Kelly]
So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause everything was never the same


[Bridge: EDEN]
And I wanna let you know
I wanna let you go
But I just can't bring myself to speak
But this is how it goes
The end credits, they roll
This bridge was built over kerosene
But we can watch it burn-

[Pre-Chorus: Leah Kelly]
And all I ever wanted
Was sunlight and honesty
Highlights to wanna repeat
Let's get away from here and
Live like the movies do
I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think

[Chorus: EDEN & Leah Kelly]
So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause you can wish away forever
But you'll never find a thing like today

[Snippet]
Eyes fixed on the ground
Am I holdin' you up?
No talkin' through
Nowhere for the sing-

[Verse 1: ATO]
Yo
Two-piece running off the neck, yeah
Those some wild nights running up in West, yeah
Fuck the talk I'm just tryna see the net, yeah
In the dark boy, there's a lot of noise here
Yeah, the rose Gold come in so clean, what's the time?
On my third eye 'cause they wanna scheme on a guy
Lifetime, and I dot my I's cross my T's
Lay low, touch Notting Hill with my G's

[Chorus: ATO]
Falling tonight
Shit ain't perfect but I'm fine
You can kill the bright lights for the night
Wonder if it's all just in my head
And the sunsets, quite red
I can already feel tomorrow on my neck
She don't know why I'm tripping and neither do I
Drinking 'till we sinking and I hand you my mind

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
2AM and I just got to East on Shoreditch High Street
We outside the Ace like I'm on broadway with my posse
Black Tesla, so I don't need a driver
We fucking on the M1, that's what I call a rider
If shawty look like Winnie, I save her like Macgyver
The double F is Fendi
The double G is me
And she know my dick notori-ous, shit is B.I.G, ay
I can make you famous, I call TMZ
She in PrettyLittleThing, looking like a P.Y.T
Kris Kites Jesus chain, looking like the G.O.D
God damn, what's that? Sending photos on WhatsApp
Shawty caught me slipping, got me falling for a thirst trap


[Chorus: ATO]
Falling tonight
Shit ain't perfect but I'm fine
You can kill the bright lights for the night
Wonder if it's all just in my head
And the sunsets, quite red
I can already feel tomorrow on my neck
She don't know why I'm tripping and neither do I
Drinking 'til we sinking and I hand you my mind

[Verse 3: ATO]
Mirror flip the light
Feel the moment swinging
Dripping
Flying or I'm falling
Depend on where you're sitting
I ain't saying much
When the beat cut
Keep my eyes closed
We're going all or nothing
Underpass
Drown, switching lanes, pushing ninety-five
The sky bleeding by design, on my Dev Hynes
Make a left, pull the light, hit the side street
Couldn' stop for the night, moving light speed
I don't take advice, when the stakes high
If I get it then it's mine and I split it twice
What you running from
Is where you're running to
Boy, if you cross the line, know I'ma have to pull you back
Yeah, that's how I was raised, it's a fact
Left foot in the white
Right foot in the black

[Outro: ATO]
This life is lonely if you give it your all
They can't feel this moment like you want them to
The unknown makes you feel small
What you're running from is what you're running to
And she chasing the sunset
Left me in the darkness
How could I forget?
Girl, you're still my friend


[Intro]
Come on, what's the big deal? Nobody's that heartless!

[Verse 1]
So listen here, I'm the voice in your head
And I can say the words that make you feel scared
So here's to you, and all the problems that we've made
And I know it's so hard to stay afloat
When you make monsters out of thoughts
And you're dragged under
And everyone in around you is too far away to notice
Your chest start to crush, oh, but it's alright
Oh, you'll be alright
So just breathe, it's almost over
And don't let the monster in your head
Become your fears
'Cause you can save yourself, you know
You know

[Verse 2]
So listen here, I know it's hard
Maybe I can't be what you want
But I'm just who I am, and I'm trying to be what you could need
And I am still here, that voice in your head
And I'll be there for you, when no one else cares
And this is it, as far as where we've got since then
So know a good thing when you got it
And I hope you know you don't go alone

[Outro]
Come on, what's the big deal? Nobody's that heartless!
You know it's time
It's time to decay


[Chorus]
On days when you feel like
It's me, won't you say hi
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
On days when you feel like
It's me, won't you say hi
Won't play with you meanwhile
It all fades, can we re start
All I feel
Can you feel it too (Yo)
All I am (Yo Beautiful, how could you feel alone)
(Truth be told, I love you more than anything I've ever known)

[Verse 1]
Through the storm
Bridges burnt and kept us warm in the cold
I grew up travelling this globe, you've been my only home
Boy I jumped, woke up flying
Blinded by the lights
Just know if I'm gone for a while
It's because I'm changing your life
Brush off the frame, still I'm blessed
I give no fucks for the rest
I got a show tonight
I'm flying through the voice in my head
No longer question the skies
Lost in the hustle and bustle
Uniting over the heavens
But we fighting over the struggle
New love rise then it fall
I'm keeping my circle small
Split Amaretto with Mum
And we let that talk
I'm caught up in the present, forgot the strength of my past
Had to stop, watch this shadow of mind pass over my heart
So dark it shines forever
My phone dead, while I'm stringing all these sentences together
Got to thinking 'bout my brother
I'm losing bare sleep over anxiety pains
Watching my friends getting pulled into different frames
I'll get you next time
I put that on my whole life
The train passed as the night burned
I wonder, who was that girl
(And yea sometimes I feel like i'm losing you by sticking around)

[Chorus]
On days when you feel like
It's me, won't you say hi
Won't play with you meanwhile
It all fades, can we re start
All I feel
Can you feel it too
All I am

[Post-Chorus]
Feel the lie
When you're on the slide
Won't you take your time
Won't you make it right
Don't wanna make it ghost
So you won't say that

[Verse 2]
And I'm falling away
One day I'll be strong
Always seem to get small things so fucking wrong
This, will be alright when you frame it
I'll go
Give me a lie for when I'm lying awake
The feelings I have they can't make you stay
This, will be alright when you frame it (On days when you feel like)
I'll go (It's me, won't you say hi)
You stay (Won't play with you meanwhile)
On the right side (It all fades, can we re start)
Of the wrong time (All I feel, can you feel it too)
All I am (Won't play with you meanwhile)
(It all fades, can we re start)
And it's all I owe you
Can you feel it broken, two

[Intro]
I can't find you
But can't fault you, 'cause I
Can get so caught up in my own head
You just float through, I can't catch you
And I can understand but can't face the feeling
That I'm just another end

[Chorus]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Verse]
But I can float too, and I don't ask for much from you
And maybe that's too much, too soon
So I, keep rolling through the blackout
No fires without some fallout
Made peace out of the pieces
Now I can't take it back now, no
But I keep on track now up
And yeah, that's all of it
I gave up my youth for this 'cause I wanted it, and
If you think that I need you then you're out of your head
But I want you

[Bridge]
So bring me down and drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And I'll lay me down, unfinished now
It hurts

[Chorus]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Refrain]
Come back to you, come back to you
Oh, it's always you, gon' come back to you
Come back to you, gon' come back to you, yeah
Come back to you

[Bridge]
So bring me down and drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And I'll lay me down, unfinished
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Chorus]
When you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to, if you let me
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Outro]
"There you go Jonathon that's another problem solved"

[Intro]
I can't find you
But can't fault you, 'cause I
Can get so caught up in my own head
You just float through, I can't catch you
And I can understand but can't face the fear
That I'm just another end

[Chorus]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Verse]
I can float too, and I don't ask for much from you
But maybe that's too much, too soon
So I, keep rolling through the blackout
No fires without some fallout
Made peace out of the pieces
Now I can't take it back now, no
Keep on track now up
Yeah, that's all of it
I gave up my youth for this 'cause I wanted it, and
If you think that I need you then you're out of your head
But I want you, no

[Bridge]
So bring me down, drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And i'll lay me down, finished now
Yeah

[Chorus]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Refrain]
Come back to you, come back to you
Come back to you, yeah, oh
Come back to you

[Chorus]
So bring me down, drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And i'll lay me down, finished
Yeah, oh

[Outro]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to, if you let me
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Radio chatter between ATC]

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna talk
I could leave the feeling
And honestly I'm surprised
You got nothing left to say
Call it over and over and out

[Verse 2]
I don't need a follow
I could live without it
Done with peripherals twisting my vision
I don't have control
Creating problems from boredom like recreationals

[Outro]
Burn out
Burn sky
Try
Burn out
Burn sky
Try
Burn out
Burn sky
Try
Try
Try

[Verse 1]
I don't follows fighting for a lost cause
Feel like even drifting, we're just off course

[Chorus]
Or is it no good?
What are we if dying for?
What are we lying for, oh, if it's no good?
Good, what would you call it?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Mind if I don't end this dying (I don't follows fighting for a lost cause)
If it's worth it, you would know (Feel like even drifting, we're just off course)

[Verse 3]
Oh, it stops, all the faking, it's all fire
No flame can absolve sin
Oh, it's nothing
I'll get sullen, when I get sober
Despite my best, you keep calling


[Outro]
You got something I don't want to miss out on
I don't leave you over your stead
Would you call that love?
Love
Love
Love, love
You call that love?
Love
Love, love
Would you call that love?
Love
Love, love
All that love
Love
Love, love


[Intro]
Life is just going so quickly, I can't catch it
I don't think anyone can

[Verse 1]
I met the devil in the hills last night
I was driving by myself, alone
He said, "Boy, what you running from?"
I said, "I don't know"
I don't know if it was a better time
But girl, we were giants then
Endless nights, we were infinite (So, terrified, I guess)
Summer's end would mean the death of us

[Chorus]
But summer past, and we grew up
And all of our paths, they split up
And I haven't seen your face or heard your voice in so long
So, so long
We had a good run, it's over now
(No, I'm not sad about it, but, I'm just, it's weird)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, lying on the grass, talk is so old
Living under Orion, we grew so bold
Lying on our days, we were outlaws
Our loss, but
Catch me if you can, never wiped out
Tryin' to catch a wave, tryin' to break out
I guess I didn't know
And now I'm gone
But it don't hurt me anymore
That's just the way it goes
Yeah, I should've known
But, I heard you talking through the walls late last night
"There are no ends, just grays and half-lives" (Left me in pieces)
Half-time (And I heard it), it's alright (And I heard it)


[Chorus]
That summer past, and we grew up
And all of our plans, they split us up
And I haven't seen your face or heard your voice in so long
So, so long
We had a good run, it's over now

[Interlude]
So, please, don't fade me out
So, please, don't fade me out
So, please, don't lose me now
I heard the words that you never said
Smokescreen from a cigarette
Exhale, we can never be what's in our heads
(So, please, don't fade me out)
Elevation doesn't matter now, it's straight ahead
Sending shivers down my spine, life pirouettes
It's cool, we're used to losing real friends
Only ever feeling it in retrospect
(So, please, don't lose me now)
And we were really breathing, not silhouettes
Maybe in another dream this would never end

[Outro]
'Cause everything is not alright
And we are falling
But that's just life
Without some lows, there is no highs
And everything will be okay
Though we are all hurting
'Cause time flies fast
And you know, no pain is forever
Ever, forever
(I don't think, I'm not saying you should
Be really cautious and shit, I'm, quite the opposite
Just like it's, everything is so, I mean
Expecting anything to last forever is ridiculous isn't it?
I think that's ridiculous
You think that's ridiculous?
Yeah, of course everything lasts forever)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you spoke of how you believed in God
But didn't believe in religion
You saw heaven in your son's eyes
As you closed yours
I've learnt nothing is mine
Now I've soaked up every shore
Never felt more alive
My expections drowned in the tide
The dark days aren't over
While you're looking for closure
They're still looking for you
But the darkness might pass over
If you're quiet enough
As it does every night

As you're still and watching the world from the outside
I've been walking alone for a while
Thinking about us I've gone far and
Afraid to call out in case I don't hear your response
Ten days adrift
Wrote a night of clarity for me
Feeling invisible as the wind whispered to the sea

I see words in your pictures
You see pictures in my words
Every perfect moment requires a slight uncertainty
Like my faith, no person should be alone
Long enough to feel the mirror change
I thought I left my heart back there with you
But here it is following me
And I'm ashamed to say it
As you watch a small city unfold
So behind it's ability to think forward
Re-opened your mind to see God in perfect timing
Your blessing

[Chorus]
I'll lose you for the life I'm chasing
I didn't come back the same
I know it, you know it too
It's falling so heavy on you lately
Head on my chest but
You never felt more alone (You never felt more alone)
It takes time to wake up on the right side
Oh, it's just a habit I'm breaking, for good
It's just another life phasing - good

[Verse 2]
I've never felt this pressure like my wings are spreading
I feel no way, feel no way, yeah that's the Devil singing
Take you time with me like it means something
And we can talk for hours and let time listen
You're talking about life like you'll live forever
She look into his eyes until he dream about her
Running from something and mask it as wisdom
But I listen cause I see the truth and in truth it feels nice

[Bridge]
It feels nice when you let go
It feels wrong, it feels right
You know some things
You know some things

It feels nice when you let go
It feels wrong, it feels right
You know some things
You know some things

[Chorus]
I'll need you for the life I'm chasing
I didn't come back the same
I know it, you know it too
It's falling so heavy on you lately
Head on your chest but
You never felt more alone
It takes time to wake up on the right side
Oh, it's just a habit I'm breaking, for good
It's just another life phasing - good

[Verse 1: EDEN]
The morning light shines a lifeline
Escape is what I need
I should've listened last night, girl
This is beyond belief
That we keep falling for the lure of
Liquid confidence and lies
And we skydive from walls we built
Dying just to feel alive

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN]
On the way down screamin'

[Chorus: EDEN]
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming

[Verse 2: EDEN]
Oh, I'm on fire
There's a burning in my bones and in my eyes
These dreams, they're taking hold, I just need time
Time

[Verse 3: gnash]
Building walls to burn them down
Cannonballs to watch me drown
You've got me lost in here and now
You've got me gone and lost and found
We only hang in evenings
And I don't know what I'm thinking
But I know that I won't think it
If I keep up with this thinking
All these dreams and all these plans
We shared under the moonlight
They're dreams and plans that I have
I just don't know if you'll fit right
When I leave in the morning
And I kiss you and say goodnight
I kick myself until we kick it
Should've told you goodbye
Coming home so late at night
With clothes covered in sand
I don't know just what I'm missing
But I'm doing what I can
And if all we have is time then we will find

Interlude:
Boy you are in a hurry!
If you were lookin' at what I'm looking at you'd be in a hurry too


[Chorus: EDEN]
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright (Whoa)
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night (Whoa)
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright (Whoa)
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night (Whoa)
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming

Step up to the Funtime Dance Floor
(Dance Floor)
Where we play you music plus more
(Plus more)
Don't be scared of what will happen
(Happen)
We're just having fun and dancin'
(Dancin')
These monstrous animatronics are haunting me
Possessed electronics following me
I can't get my work done in peace
Crawling in air ducts from room to room
Feeling like this place is my tomb
I'm just tryin to survive, else I'll die soon
There's something sick and sadistic about this place
It sets the off at night
No one will believe me, so I gotta fight
To move on
Through their dance of death
They're all around me now
I can't catch my breath
Funtime watching you at night
Come here
Never fear our bite
Don't scream
You'll just make it worse
This dance
Is our undying curse
Dance Floor
Dance Floor
Funtime Dance Floor
Funtime Dance Floor
Funtime Dance Floor
Dance Floor
Dance Floor
When I hit the floor
It's about to be a show
Ain't nowhere to go
Just to let you know
(Just to let you know)
When I hit the floor
It's about to be a show
I know you want some more
Yeah baby let's go
(Yeah baby let's)
Please let me free
(We'll never let you go free)
(We'll never let you leave)
(We'll never let you go free)
(We'll never let you be)
Oh, Please just let me be
(We'll never let you go free)
(We'll never let you leave)
(We'll never let you go free)
(We'll never let you be)
Funtime watching you at night
Come here
Never fear our bite
Don't scream
You'll just make it worse
This dance
Is our undying curse
Funtime watching you at night
Come here
Never fear our bite
Don't scream
You'll just make it worse
This dance
Is our undying curse

[Intro]
Don't know how well this is gonna be
But, the basic idea is-

[Verse 1]
Free fall for now
Desert air won't drown you out
And for a second I thought the world was ending
And I couldn't breathe in
Yeah, and so this isn't your time
Yeah, been chasing kairos with those scapegoat eyes
Can't you realize?
Fuck the summertime, it's you
So scared of overgrowing youth
When it's not done with you

[Chorus]
And everybody gon' run, run
Everybody gon' run, run
And you can call it what you want
But I call it moving on
And I'm so done with singing words I don't believe in no more

[Verse 2]
So what you rushing for?
Who said it's now or never?
I think you're taking on the wrong advice
But it's alright if these are your worst times
You know you're good
You're good


[Interlude]
And if you want you can breathe on your own
This isn't what I thought but it's beautiful
Make peace with your mistakes and they'll turn to gold
Weightless, I let  go

[Chorus]
And everybody gon' run, run
Everybody gon' run, run
And you can call it what you want
But I call it moving on
And I'm so done with singing words I don't believe in no more

[Outro]
No more, call it what you want
Call it what you want but I call it growing up and I'm done



Sunday night, have a good cry
Wipe my eye, as the light died

I can't help but see your eyes from here
But I, a thousand miles away
And years ago

This time I tell 'em white lies
Walk my eyes, say I'm alright

I can't help but see your eyes from here
But I, a thousand miles away
And years ago

She said, "Don't try; figure it out
You won't find me thinking about you
Know that we're both better off this way
And I guess I won't make a sound
You won't find me crying about you
Know that there's just nothing else to say."

(Don't try; figure it out
You won't find me thinking about you
Know that we're both better off this way
And I guess I won't make a sound
You won't find me crying about you
Know that there's just nothing else to say.)

I can't help but see your eyes from here
But I, a thousand miles away
And years ago


[Intro]
I never had the guts to run away
Ever since sixteen, been dreaming of a brighter day
Out of control and out of everything
You came out the blue, or was it blue-gray?

[Verse]
Felt like waking up in a new place (New place, new place)
That stole the dark from the night
Shone a new way, ooh (New way, new way)
But I can feel your heartbeat rising
Even when you're ghost
And I can feel your every single movement

[Chorus]
So, good morning (Good morning)
Good morning (Good morning)
Good morning
It's a good morning (Good morning, yeah)
Good morning (Good morning)
Good morn-

[Verse]
I felt like waking up in a new place, ooh (As day breaks mortality)
That stole the dark from the night (Colors run and bleed)
Shone a new way, yeah (New way, new way)
(For fear now's the only time there is)
But I can feel your heartbeat rising (And just as good night comes following)
Even when you're ghost (Follow down and seem)
And I can feel your every single move (I, who watched this disappear)


[Chorus]
So, good morning (And out of the dark you'll find you)
Good morning
Good morning (Given the time and space)
It's a good morning
Good morning (The world will bend to guide you)
Good morning

[Outro]
I never had the guts to run away
(And just as good night comes following)
(And out of the dark you'll find you)
Ever since sixteen, been dreaming of a brighter day
(Follow down and seem)
(Given the time and space)
Out of control and after everything
(I, who watched this disappear)
(The world will bend to guide you)
You came out the blue

[Intro]
I never had the guts to run away
Ever since sixteen
Been dreaming of a brighter day
Out of control and out of everything
You came out the blue
Or was it blue gray

[Verse]
Felt like waking up
In a new place (New place, new place)
Stole the dark from the night
Shone a new way, ooh (New way, new way)
And i can feel your heartbeat rising
Even when you're a ghost
I can feel your every single move

[Chorus]
So good morning
Good morning
Good morning
So good good morning
Good morning
Good mor-

[Verse]
Felt like waking up
In a new place (New place, new place)
Stole the dark from the night
Shone a new way (New way, new way)
I can feel your heartbeat rising
Even when you're a ghost
I can feel your every single move


[Chorus]
So good morning
Good morning
(And out of the dark you'll find you)
Good morning
(Given the time and space)
It's a good morning
Good morning
(The world will bend to guide you)
Good morning

[Outro]
I never had the guts to run away
(And just as good night comes following)
Ever since sixteen
Been dreaming of a brighter day
(Follow down and seem)
Out of control and out of everything
(I, who watched this disappear)
You came out the blue



[Verse 1]
I wanted you to be the last thing on my mind
I wanted you to be the reason I close my eyes
But I can't sleep
And oh God, I wanted to be your high
But everything I said, it went unheard
And everything you saw with eyes straight blurred
Became our downfall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you say I drink and I smoke and I talk too much
But I know you lied when you said that you just gotta go and save yourself
So hear me out
You know everybody talks, girl
And it means nothing 'till you let it
But if you keep second guessing then there's only gonna be one end

[Chorus]
But you can leave if you really want to
And you can run if you feel you have to
Now I'll be fine if you ever ask me
I know it's hard, but no one said it's easy
Falling's easy
But there's only one way up

[Verse 2]
So I been thinking that I think too much
And I can't sleep, but I can dream of us
And I've been seeing shit like horror cuts
It's burning down, I gotta drown this out
And you said you need me to let this go
But it's who I am, or am I just losing it
'Cause you said jump and I went first but falling's always been my downfall

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say I drink and I smoke and I talk too much
But I know you lied when you said that you just had enough and save yourself
So hear me out
You know everybody talks, girl
And it means nothing 'till you let it
And if you keep second guessing then there's only gonna be one end

[Chorus]
But you can leave if you really want to
And you can run if you feel you have to
And I can drink if I feel I have to
I know it's hard, but I can't feel like I used to
Like I used to
'Cause I used to defy gravity
Defy gravity
Goodbyes keep dragging me
Down
And I'm fighting gravity
Defying gravity
I tried but I keep falling
'Cause falling's easy
But it only brings you down

I only ask to get ahead of me
So I can see the man in the cemetery
And I was in love with the prophecy
Just another slave to hypocrisy
People distracted by the world outside
And fail to see the world when they close their eyes
I'm feeling the imbalance, hatred and malice between us
Why we at war? We should be more like Venus

I was born by the river, raised by the queen
Faced with reality, mind willing to dream
Contemplating a life of freedom
I was forced to turn my back on the door that saw everyone leaving
Rock bottom is a strong foundation
Built an empire on it with some words in the basement
We write the truth and then they write us off
Just a couple lines that Malcolm was willing to cross
I came back home with a rose and some torn up clothes
Played it next to a desperate note but it remained composed
I said Lord for I see but I cannot sail
How does one win when he's ready to fail?
I know you know my heart, my spirit, my soul
I been overwhelmed by fear since I was nine years old

She came in my life so unexpected
She felt love before I had it resurrected
If you are, you are who you say you are
You are out of this world, you are Jupiter
Now that would explain this new atmosphere
We didn't plan it to be hard and to be so far

But we've gone, baby we've gone
So you take it off when I turn it on
Walk in my mind into the unknown
I walk in your's and we can get lost

Tell me when you're down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down

And I was born by the river, raised by the queen
Faced with reality, mind willing to dream
Contemplating a life of freedom
I was forced to turn my back on the door that saw everyone leaving
Rock bottom is a strong foundation
Built an empire on it with some words in the basement
We write the truth and then they write us off
Just a couple lines that Malcolm was willing to cross

You said you had a tunnel for a past
And described when you saw the end glisten like a star
While from so far I'm an alien
We see different worlds in our craniums
See these are vivid words, vivid dreams, lonely nights
You're gonna spend all your time making money
'Til you spend all your money making up for lost time

Life ain't easy, sunrise by the stream, tell life to meet me
Stuck in a place only I can free me, deep in the east in the belly of the beast
I know you know that this ain't easy but I get my bottles for free
Deep in the valley where my shadow don't sleep, we get to stalling while brothers are balling

'Cause we are more life for the ready
More hard, Henny gets buried with the Penny
I die, you die, they die heavy
You live, I live, not so many
Welcome to the matrix
Parallel world where we're living
It took space to see the world that we live in
And it took time, it took pain, it took vision
And I've never been here before
She came down like a meteor
Yes, I'm young and I'm insecure
I've seen too many leave like a sycamore
And she cool - like ice sometimes
But she can save you - from your hardest times
Like old Gods and I don't really fuck with the others
My back gets up with the others
And I'm analyzing the time and I'm seeing this widen
My pen gets to pain like an ambulance siren
I pray to not pray, then I pray it again
I been deep where faith is the only way
I depict my own flaws and slam my own doors
The shit I've seen would leave you lock-jawed
I'm a young fighter, deep thinker, raw writer
Walk through the dark 'til the sun finds your shadow

The more they hate me the more they help me
The more they love me the more they hurt me
The dynamic of a lonely journey
I failed to say a word but I know that you heard me
Your absence is present, I feel it
Praying on the day I count my blessings and mean it
Close my eyes and see the devil trynna be Jesus
In a world where believers are trynna be leaders

But he's completely lost

I'm just my darkest fear and my greatest achievement
Thousands of snakes and I'm back with EDEN
Faith is staying strong without notorious reason
They say God is love and that love is freedom
But love took my heart and it left me bleeding
Love had my on my knees begging and pleading
Love showed me the valley of the shadow of death
Love showed me life is a beautiful test
A man told me people live Hell on Earth
That's why I had to put down a hell of a verse
They say life's a bitch but she's beautiful
Motherfuckers out here are tryna snatch her purse
And she said who you gonna be?
Every breath's cost but that karma comes free
She can see I'm not afraid to show her my fears
And when I'm gone I hope she remembers the words I whispered in her ear
Said she said who you gonna be?
Every breath's cost but that karma comes free
She can see I'm not afraid to show her my fears
And when I'm gone I hope she remembers the words I whispered in her ear
I said, yeah, I got a tunnel for a past
And described when I saw the end glisten like a star
Where I'm from's so far, I'm an alien
We see different worlds in our craniums

And now a great thing in the street
Seems any human nod
Where a move in strange democracy
The million masks of God
The million masks of the joker
Because the joker is the player
The trick player
Who plays ultimately the great trick on himself
So really, there can be no resentment about this, nobody to blame, nobody to turn around in the end and say:
"You, you bastard! You did this to me!"
Because it's always you, who are ultimately responsible

When life draws for the side table
I feel to pause, watch it flash before your maple eyes
Being fed lies through the cage we've been held inside
Heaven is the answer to the question that we're living in

And there's an opposite to everything
Yang and yin compelled by the sedative we're letting in
Time counting down 'til there's no tomorrows left for me
One-way trip to heaven had me sitting in the window seat

Long talks with the man in the mirror
But he don't move when I move, we used to be together
I see clouds when I close my eyes
But it ain't rained in years, it might rain tonight

I might see everything clear, tear after tear
I'm gonna climb my fears, you can't tell me 'bout peers
Can't trust 'em 'til the end 'cause the end ain't your friend
When you run out of love 'cause all that love got spent

I've been spending these days on my own
Being thrown like a stone into the sea, the unknown
Escaped a long line of clones in the queue for purpose
People that don't know themselves make me nervous

They call this home, I call it the unknown
Trapped between letting go and the need for control
Still looking for the spaceship that we crashed and burned
For we were looking for Heaven when we fell on Earth

You said that I said that I'm yours
I told you that I made myself at home in your flaws
They be learning from the greats while I learn from their mistakes that found the Devil's gates
Amen

[Chorus]
We've been here since Sunday died
Eyes closed, I never pray for the heights
Tough past but nothing we never made it through
Tell that young me, yeah, I'm still with you
So keep running, don't stop yo, keep running
I've been nothing, being something filled somebody's soul
And I keep running, stay fronting, the pain is numbing
The war here is pure, I swear I can hear you calling

[Verse]
And she's new to the city
Running from a couple milli
Got a voice like Whitney Houston
And she don't wanna tell me where she came from
Yeah, she said she wants to leave it all behind
I told her I got nothing, she said that's a lie
She's afraid to show me her feelings
If I'm honest, if I'm honest
We go through the same
(Sample)
And I been here before
I can't make the same mistakes with you
You're so afraid to, so afraid to
So selfishly
You see these words don't fit between these lines
My I's are too big
Brother slipping for retail
Grabbing apples for females
All that shit plays out when the bank's too big
Yeah, it's all games until the boy can't quit
Back by the stream on my own
Stone after stone
But none of them gon' make it
Clone after clone
See, I always kept it real
More money, more snakes
She took on the world
But this mirror she couldn't face
Time's passing me by
What it costs to feel alive
More money till you blind
You got four, I want five
And I'm better than I was
I bet she'd call that showing off
They ain't with us, they against us
Sometimes I need to feel lost
I told you I don't want the fame
Lyrics for a face
Tell me what really fucking changed
Apart from how you say my name
Been on the right side of your life
Every fucking time
But in your eyes I saw a mountain
And I wasn't ready to climb
[Bridge]
This song don't have an end
How much time you spend on that money though
You're so afraid to let it go
But you ain't lived in a year or two
And maybe we should talk about it
ATO, are you're still there?
I ain't never left you
You're always on my mind, I can't forget you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
We've been here since Sunday died
Eyes closed I never prayed for the heights
Tough past but nothing we never made it through
Tell that young me, yeah, I'm still with you
So keep running, don't stop yo, keep running
I've been nothing
Being something filled somebody's soul
And I keep running, stay fronting, the pain is numbing
The water here is pure
I swear I can hear you calling

[Outro]
I heard you like to pray
Heard you like to pray
Heard you learned to pray for me
We've been here since Sunday died
Feel alive

[Verse]
I never had the guts to run away
Ever since sixteen, been dreaming of a brighter day
Out of control and out of everything
You came out the blue, or was it blue-gray?
Felt like waking up in a new place (New place, new place)
We stole the dark from the night
Shone a new way, ooh (New way, new way)
But I can feel your heartbeat rising
Even when you're a ghost
And I can feel your every single movement

[Outro]
How fast the light died out
We lost track of ourselves, riding the wave (Woah)
At last, the time will run out
Waited for us, don't you lose it now (You gave up, yeah)
Don't you lose me now

[Verse 1]
I can't see a way through
And I can't be myself around you (If I'm honest)
I can't stop myself from thinkin' it's all over (Yeah)
You're gonna stop crying
And after the end comes whatever (Forever I still think of you)
And ever you need me (And ever you've lost touch of you)
These songs all loop

[Interlude]
Touchdown, giant leap
Heartbreak, godspeed
Highlight, headland
Edge of the world, fading out

[Verse 2]
And I loved how the sky burned
Soaking now, we slip apart (Soaking now, I'm fallin' apart)
Older now, I can't tell you and me apart (Apart)
I just wanted to let you know (You)
That I burnt when the sky heard (Sky heard how you stopped)
Disintegrate and fall apart (Plain sight)
Running out of time (Unfolding inside)
Can never beat the lesser (The courage drought)
Of idle stress, and all the rest of it
Enough to move you
I'm just scared that you'll cu-

[Chorus]
Still, I loved every second of it
And I can't have the past and where I'm going
Said just take the best of all the pieces (How one loose end, and one step)
And the reasons you're gone (Luck is down, that you left)
Still, I see myself in all the people I let go (Deja vu, pass through)
I'm just scared that you'll l-

[Bridge]
Yeah, older now, I keep pouring over those lives white lies
Holding out, how many seconds 'til the roof falls in?

[Verse 3]
So ice the hurt
Last time enough, forever breaks us up
Connotations burnt into my lexicon (Yeah)
Foreign feelings riot until the past is won
All my friends forgot but I'm still holding on
I keep fucking up
My lines get crossed and you wanna die often
How you gonna hide all those tears from me?
All you wanted just slipped through changing times
It's not the same
Oh, I'm just scared that you'll c-

[Chorus]
Still, I loved every second of it
And I can't have the past and where I'm going
Said just take the best of all the pieces (How one loose end, and one step)
And the reasons you're gone (Luck is down, that you left)
Still, I see myself in all the people I let go (Deja vu, pass through)
I'm just scared that you'll l-

[Verse 1]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so and this I know for sure
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
And thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how

[Chorus]
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya

[Verse 2]
You think you got it, oh, you think you got it
But "got it" just don't get it when there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when's there's feelings involved
If what they say is "nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes love the exception?
And why-o, why-o, why-o, why-o, why-o, why-o
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here? Yeah

[Chorus]
But hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya

[Outro]
I'm too cool, I'm too cool for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cold, I'm too cool for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cool
I'm too cold

[Intro]
I don't think I knew
That I felt like I knew what I was doing
But I don't really remember feeling very scared about it

[Verse]
The water was cool, and you're shining
The windows were burning patterns in my mind
Running away was so tiring
Holding your stare, I felt miles behind

[Pre-Chorus]
And how do you love when you're frightened?
The thought of me fucking up all these threads
Situations I know are just passing
I'm holding on for you
And static feel

[Chorus]
The light ran down the wall
Holding back the stars
Dividing us in new ways
Away from sleep
Confusion has its cost
Wave pools in the dark
Crashing 'round my head

[Bridge]
I don't think there was like, a happiest time
I feel like there are happy moments

[Verse]
The water was cool, and you're shining
The windows were burning patterns in my mind
Running away was so tiring
Holding your stare, I slip miles behind

[Pre-Chorus]
And how do you love when you're frightened?
The thought of me fucking up all these threads
Situations I know are just passing
I'm holding on for you
And how to sleep

[Chorus]
The light ran down the wall
Holding back the stars
Dividing us in new ways
Away from sleep
Confusion has its cost
Wave pools in the dark
Crashing 'round my head

[Verse 1]
So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop the sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow, how
When all you know is up, it's hard not to feel like you ain't going down, down

[Verse 2]
Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversating with a smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now
Somehow, anyhow
So now

[Pre-Chorus]
Icarus
No, I can't escape this fall
Falling in reverse
Falling in reverse

[Chorus]
So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got?
I've nothing left to give you
And I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause it all just feels the same
And I got all I want
I had you where I wanted
I guess I don't know
How to live with a good thing
And not break it into nothing
Self destruct just to feel, or so it goes

[Verse 3]
One (Thank you so much, guys)
So tell me how you want me here now
Keep crying down the phone
Yeah, that's all I seem to hear now
Keep lying through your teeth
Lie to me, lie with me now
(I'm halfway there, but it's like, shit, I haven't really been doing anything for the last year. And it's insane that I've been doing a shit ton but like, in terms of... I don't know.)

[Verse 4]
So tell me how you really feel now
Ain't been asked that in a while
Yet you still hope that they'll hear you out
Just keep at it, bro, these things always seem to fix themselves somehow
Suck it up, some would kill just to stand
Where you're standing now

Icarus
No I can't escape this fall

[Chorus]
So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got?
I've nothing left to give you
'Cause I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause fuck it, it all feels the same
And I got all I want
I thought that I'd feel something
Guess I'll never know
How to live with a good thing
Fucked my life up for nothing, nothing
'Cause you don't care if I'm still bleeding
You just scream until you hear my name

[Outro]
So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop that sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow
Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversating with the smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now
Somehow, anyhow
By now

[Verse]
I feel no certain way performing
With foreign strings and final season growth
Oh, I can't find you
And I don't know if I want to
I can't find you
And I don't know
And worst won't follow the meaning
As lies don't find
It's seeming that words don't fall
As easy as I wanted them to
And if the center of all is nothing
Then I'm sure we'll meet again
'Cause as the sun, it sets in circles
In elliptical faces in darkness, I know
I don't

[Verse 1]
I tied it to speechless
And I tried to piece it
Together
We didn't talk for a while
I know the flying made you cry
But thinking about it now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd burn some bridges, sure
Cut some people out and leave them behind, sure
And if we ever were the same
I'd be the rain

[Chorus]
And you'd be tomorrow
And I'd be the rain
Oh, you'd be tomorrow
And I'd be the rain

[Verse 2]
I tied it to speechless
And I tried to piece it
Together
And falling apart at the seams
But it meant everything
To me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd burn some bridges, sure
Cut some people out and leave them behind, sure
And if we ever were the same
I'd be the rain

[Chorus]
And you'd be tomorrow
And I'd be the rain
Oh, you'd be tomorrow
And I'd be the rain

You know, our progress is just really slow
Because we're trying to just find ways through
And we're just veering
Backwards at times just to get through some of this stuff
And it's just crazy, all the things that we have to do

[Verse 1]
I'll say it once for the Bayside
I come alive when the light dies
Overcast but we're inside
Eyes wide, lied twice
My advice don't mean shit tonight
'Cause I've been driving though I can't see shit and I've
Been lying through my teeth just to get the feeling right
And feel alright
So girl just turn the lights down
Yeah
And too many times I've been caught up when I know better
So I push it back down 'cause I never want to let it out
But I've been dying since I saw you were gone
Forget me 'cause I ain't waiting for no-one
'Cause I ain't waiting for no-one

[Verse 2]
And I've been trying to dig my way out of the ocean
And punch a hole in the sky
And flood the light through to midnight
And I don't know where you're going
You can't expect the past to repeat with the ending changed
So don't forget where you came from
And we are never alone
Drops making waves in the ocean

[Outro]
(Phone rings...)
Hello?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Ok...

[Verse 1]
Ten tonne, ballast on my chest
As I woke up, a heavy inhale
For the nights you stole, oh
Fucked up, the balance in my head
But it's all good
I'll see you again another (Dream)
Oh

[Chorus 1]
But I miss the way the sun streamed through my window
And I miss the way you almost held the tide
But still, it's nice, dreaming that you're somewhere
Feeling the same heat that I did
Another time (I know, I know)
If invisible lines lead your way back to me
Walk the line

[Verse 2]
I said I'd walk you home but we still went our own way
The tears lost in rain on your cheekbones in silence
And I pulled my head out the darkness in your house
Can't stay 'til the morning, refracted my way out
From nightmares in my car, as I lay beside you
And fucked up my timeline and twisted your end with
So much still to go, as the sun sets behind you
I can't let it go, you can't hold me
I can't always, oh

[Bridge]
Talk it out
Cut me off
Chalk it down
To my head
Ba-balancing my head
Slow it down
Rise and fall
Chalk it down
To my head down

[Chorus 2]
And I miss the way (Talk it out)
The sun streamed through my window (Cut me off)
And I miss the way (Chalk it down)
You almost held the tide (To my head)
But still, it's nice (Balancing my head)
Dreaming that you're somewhere (Slow it down)
Feeling the same heat that I did (Rise and fall)
No fear no fall (Chalk it down) (I know, I know)
If invisible lines lead your way back to me (To my head)
Still, I got nothing, woah

[Verse 1]
And honestly, I can't sleep no more
On film it's dark but it's only reconstructing light that don't shine no more, I
Can't help but dream of nights, I can't live no more
Feelings die and she don't sleep in my arms no more, yeah

[Chorus]
But I'll get right in a little bit, I'll find
My light in the little bits
Passed out on my bedroom floor, I'll get back up
I lost my mind when I needed it, yeah
It's so sad, what we had was never enough for us
Just echoes and dust

[Refrain]
Just saying, if you want it, go find it
I'm just saying, if you want it, go find it
Just saying, if you want it, go find it
Just saying

[Verse 2]
Yeah, self-division in the dark
You were a multi-colored vision (Yeah)
Versions of another version fell apart (High speed)
Halide lifting silver linings from the dark
And it's just starting to sink in
I ran through the morning
When the light showed me nothing I didn't know before
So close but, you say we're better off
Leave the curtains drawn
I don't think you understand
How we're splitting the loop
A last impression of you, I left some time ago
So how you gon' catch me now? (Fuck it all up)
Woah, these waves just keep ringing out

[Bridge]
So slowly, I watched it burn
So slowly, yeah
All the things that we love tie us up
Just echoing slowly

[Chorus]
I'll get right in a little bit (So slowly, I watched it burn)
I'll find my light in the little bits
Passed out on my bedroom floor
I'll get back, get back up
I lost my mind when I needed it, yeah (So slowly, yeah)
It's so sad, but what we had was never enough for us (All the things that we love)
Just echoes and dust

[Refrain]
Just saying, if you want it, go find it
I'm just saying, if you want it, go find it
Just saying, if you want it, go find it
Just saying

[Outro]
How fast the light died out
We lost track of ourselves, riding the wave (Woah)
At last, the time of our lives
Waited for us, don't you lose it now (You gave up, yeah)
Don't you lose me now

[Intro]
Hey, how are you doing?
I just wanted to say that I miss you, I guess
And I'm sorry
Call me back
Bye

[Verse 1: EDEN]
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel now
60 over the limit just 'cause I can
They say, "You know, you gotta slow down
There's no coming back"
So young and restless, I'm a cliche, yeah
But it's easier said than done

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN]
And I can't keep waiting here
I'm just aging
So I'm gone
Such a shame, and

[Chorus: EDEN]
Baby, I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in saying "I'm never coming home"
But I'm drawing the line
And say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known

[Verse 2: EDEN]
So falling in and falling out fast
I'm burning up, I can't believe this got old so fast
And I'm done with feeling like I'm told I should
'Cause it's a feeling I'm chasing
And I ain't found it here in a while

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN]
But I can't keep waiting here
I'm just aging
So I'm gone
Such a shame, and

[Chorus: EDEN]
Baby, I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in saying "I'm never coming home"
But I'm drawing the line
And say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known

[Outro: EDEN]
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving

[Verse 1: ATO]
Oh I know
Someone else has been here before
And I'm sure you gave them everything
And kisses turned to fucking and that fucking turned to loving
One rumour and two questions had that love turn into nothing

It's so usual, you're so predictable
When you rush when you first meet you end up falling on your knees
And begging, please
Forgive me
I love you, tell me you love me

And she said please, just listen to me
It's not me it's you
You've become somebody new

[Chorus: ATO & EDEN]
And we die
But you and I we are still alive
Don't tell me it'll be alright
Got me feeling like I'm being so cold

And we both know that this is how we die
And together you know we just can't survive
Don't tell me it'll be alright
We both know that this is our demise
The end of a lifetime

[Verse 2: ATO]
You see life ain't the same without me, is it?
You heard I'm in the city, you want me to pay a visit
The problem is, I don't owe you nothing, do I?
I'd be lying to you if I said that I don't miss it

But this is for the best that the storm before the calm arrives
Fighting till the struggle till I hit the fucking override
Huh, no
I'm just done looking for home, you know

Something wrong with wanting more? Who knows
I guess I'll have to find out
She wants all or nothing
If we're not fighting then we're --

Met her at a show, took a couple shots
Hotel, fifteen floors to the top
I don't know her name, knew I shoulda told you
I ain't playing games with you, this one made you wait on me --

I'm just falling
And I can't feel my feet so
I wake up in a new life or
Keep going down, down, down
Just tell me what I'm fighting for
And she said listen to me
There's somebody new, but before I lose you

[Bridge: ATO & EDEN]
In our lifetime you will find out everything you're looking for
And the silence when our words are lost
It says everything we can't ignore

In our lifetime you will find out everything you're looking for
And the silence when our words are lost
It says everything we can't ignore

[Chorus: ATO & EDEN]
And we die
But you and I we are still alive
Don't tell me it'll be alright
Got me feeling like I'm being so cold

And we both know that this is how we die
And together you know we just can't survive
Don't tell me it'll be alright
We both know that this is our demise
The end of a lifetime

[Intro: Puppet]
Alright, alright
Alright, alright (I'll understand)
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 1: Puppet]
Distractions
Fade away
The tides change
The waves remain
My life is out that door
Warring what's worth fighting for
Stay quiet one more day, waste away
I don't think so
Just try and hold me back
Warm-up swings
I'm next at bat
Wound up on wasted days
Swing away
Come on, lets go

[Pre-Chorus: Puppet]
Our time's up
Come out and play
Shoulder to shoulder through the pain

[Chorus: Puppet]
Left out again, that's all I am (All I am, falling)
I'll fight alone and breathe again (Alright, alright)
Take all my friends and leave with them (Alright, alright, alright, alright)
I'll understand (Alright, alright)

Alright, alright
(I'll understand)
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 2: Puppet]
Blue skies
You bring the rain
You're a whisper
They sing my name (Let's go)
I'm offended
Your pity party's ended
You can keep pretending
But I know you know who I am
I don't blend in
Just how I intended
All my patience
I spent it

[Verse 3: EDEN]
I'm calling out when you never listened
How continents felt closer than a mile
And all I can say is it's nothing I can't change

[Bridge: Puppet, EDEN & Both]
Now you tell me what to do
So call me now when you're feeling like it
But I won't turn for you
I've been running out of love, running out of time
Another life, another day
All I can say is it's there's nothing I can't change

[Chorus: Puppet]
Left out again, that's all I am (All I am, falling)
I'll fight alone and breathe again (Alright, alright)
Take all my friends and leave with them (Alright, alright, alright, alright)
I'll understand (Alright, alright)

[Outro: Puppet]
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

[Verse]
I think I lost myself out
Somewhere in between
Finding out who I am
Confusing that with what I dream
And it feels like everyone's done waiting
So what am I supposed to do?
And I can feel these bridges breaking
And I'm drifting further from you, from you
But oh, let it go
'Cause I found God
And he said, "Plans change a lot"
And, so if I can help my luck
Then things won't go the way they're going
And I won't lose hope, and I won't lose courage
And won't fade to gold
Or worse, a shadow
'Cause if everyone is gone, I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be left alone

[Intro]
(The sun can not see our home
'Til death or peace, I see you)

[Verse 1]
How do I say
All I want just falls away?
I don't know how to keep us in time, time
Mind is changing
All you want so far is love, death and some kind of higher high
You're reaching (Reaching)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we're all just drifting by
(You've got to pull yourself out)
Phones in the air
Face to the sky
(You're gonna burn yourself out)
And all this time to realize there's nothing stopping you
(How are you gonna stop it?
You can't stop yourself from being you)
From leaving
(Wanted to, wanted)

[Chorus]
And please don't go, drifter
(Staying when you're passing on, passing over me)
And please don't go, drifter
(In taking, take it, you're taken with all this)

[Verse 2]
What do I say?
All that time just thrown away
I don't know how to keep lives apart
They're bleeding (Yeah)
Mind is racing
All you want so far is love, death and some kind of higher high
You're reaching (Reaching)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we're all just drifting by
Phones in the air
Face to the sky
All this time to realize there's nothing stopping you
From leaving me
(The sun can not see our home
'Til death or peace, I see you
How you want me)

[Chorus]
And please don't go, drifter
(We all see, we are just orbiting you)
And please don't go, drifter
(Stardust in your constellation)
(Planets in your solar system)
And please don't go, drifter
(Spiral, sink in, slighting with her, violent system)
And please don't go, drifter
(I'll listen, find us waning, Ire at the odds)
(You can't hear me at all)
And please don't go, drifter
(Time is wasting, breath is wasted on you)
And please don't go, drifter
(And please don't go)

[Intro]
And I know I've been closing myself off, unsure
I know I've been real hard to reach, harder to love
And I know it's tiring, this shit is getting old

[Pre-Chorus]
But please, just hold on to me
I've slayed these demons, they're old to me
Recurring dreams, this is happening
Tearing my seams; lucid reality

[Chorus]
And I just want you to feel love (love!)
Before it disappears (not!)
'Cause we are more than we're not (wrong!)
So never fear to feel (brave!)
Good when everything's wrong (love!)
And find some beauty there (not!)
'Cause all we ever are is brave (brave!)
And your world's not ending, ooh

[Verse]
So I won't go
I'm still living in the middle of a one-way war
I can't fight it but I'm trying to be what you want, yeah
You can't sing but you're singing this anyway
And anyway, so please just hold on to me
This is no end, we're not finished here
Finding our way, we're just changing
Becoming more than I think of me, yeah
These fears in my head, dreams in my bed
They won't get the best of me, yeah
'Cause I chase dreams 'till the end
These nightmares all bend
Silver linings are all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
So, please, just hold on to me
I've slayed these demons, they're old to me
Recurring dreams, this is happening
Tearing my seams from reality

[Chorus]
And I just want you to feel love
Before it disappears
'Cause we are more than we're not
So never fear to feel
Good when everything's wrong (love!)
And find some beauty there (not!)
'Cause all we ever are is brave

[Verse 1]
I used to be a hurricane
Tell you how that really feel
Show you all that I destroyed
I grew up around the fucking way
I know you ain't really real
I can feel that when you smile
I don't care where you're from
But what you see when you close your eyes
Strangers used to be your friends
They might still be if you didn't care
Oh, I've been here before
Had to check myself to make sure

The feeling still pain
My people in a hurry
My people tryna grab at the change
Stopped looking both ways
When I saw one side is a mirror
And the world is a stage
Fuck you and your games
Are you not entertained
This was never what I pictured
I'm alone in the fray
Putting people first who couldn't say my last name
Letting people hurt, tryna test my faith like ay
Run gone
Tell my brothers, run on
That fight was for me
I'ma keep moving in my sleep till I wake from this dream
And reflect what I see

Is she worse for lying
Or me for believing
Lost Genesis, Lord I lost my freedom
Grew up in conflict
Looking for appeasement
Used to draw the light and sell it to the evening
These days we choose to judge by the preview
Sometimes getting too close
They don't see you
Shame on him for forgetting what we've been through
Shame on me for thinking I need you
Find me in the shadows of the city
Sunset falls behind the skyline
Carry the words you said to me
In case I'm in need of a lifeline

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk to the end of that thought and press the glass
Beyond this life and over Mars
Behind the canvas that holds the stars
The pale blue dot that'll hold your heart
Behind the pretty faces, behind the egos
Behind the paper and the makeshift
Finally find yourself and can't face it
So frustrating, lost conversations
Afraid to be wrong, that's why I never grew
That's why this for me even if I say you
That's why this for me even if I say her
That's why this for me even if I say him
I don't know why, sometimes I look for your face in the sky
More time I push them away
I write cos I never used to know how to say it

[Chorus]
It's just how I feel right now
I don't really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear
It's just how I feel right now
I don't really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear

[Verse 2]
Mean it
Told you that I love you, didn't mean it
Everybody here wants the feeling
Let it fill the room to the ceiling
No one really being, keeping up an appearance
Let down my dearest
Shame is what I needed
Took her to the Eiffel, tryna change her view
You gave her the city but she looking at you
I'm still tryna know myself
Know my path
Cos when you lead the way
That journey's dark
I had to shed some light on my past
I had to change the clocks before
My first alarm, I told them

The last supper
Take time, it's been a cold summer
Ooh, they wanna talk about karma
How could I wish pain on another
This film's a thriller
Sinners act as the pillars
Looking for my view
Brother you ain't supposed to miss the end
All the things that I wrote I writ in pen
You can visit them again and again
So busy talking about me
You abandoned yourself
It's just funny that you'd ask me for help
It's just another story left on the shelf
We so, insecure
Look for more
Life's too short
To step into your 44's
I mean we're young
No idea what we've got in store
Both afraid to write first
Till we fade to thoughts

[Pre-Chorus]
To the end of that thought and press the glass
Beyond this life and over Mars
Behind the canvas that holds the stars
The pale blue dot that'll hold your heart
Behind the pretty faces, behind the egos
Behind the paper and the makeshift
Finally find yourself and can't face it
So frustrating, lost conversations
Afraid to be wrong, that's why I never grew
That's why this for me even if I say you
That's why this for me even if I say her
That's why this for me even if I say him
I don't know why, sometimes I look for your face in the sky
More time I push them away
I write cos I never used to know how to say it

[Chorus]
It's just how I feel right now
I don't really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear
It's just how I feel right now
I don't really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear

[Chorus]
We used to dance with the devil on a Saturday
Just so we could go and speak to God on a Sunday
You for me
Fear
You were my closest friend
And all I did for you is true
And I Iet you lie to me
But these walls won't fall for you

[Verse 1]
To touch the sky
I'm feeling butterflies
Conflicted by the black and white
Colours what you held inside
Who am I
In this world of clones
Living in each others shadows
Afraid to be the person that our youth mourns
I've stood here before
And I've watched my brothers fall
Their silence speaks volumes
I don't need to hear anymore
Lord I just pray for the sake of my family
Still sat by that window sill
In search of your gravity

[Bridge]
I'm feeling more lights are going out
Tell me who you wanna be
You're not the person I used to know
But I'm unsure to let you go
There was some more of the truth
I didn't find
And if it's you then it's me
Turn your back

[Verse 2]
I've seen people change
And walk into different worlds
The past we framed
And left to dust by the window sill
This was never for you
I wrote this when I was 9
People fail to see your truths
I see the man beyond the blind
This pen in my hand
The shadow of mind
I never envied you once
I'm here for what's mine
My mum taught me family first
Don't try and be anyone else
I'm still the man of that house
God knows my presence is felt

[Chorus]
We used to dance with the devil on a Saturday
Just so we could go and speak to God on a Sunday
You for me
Fear
You were my closest friend
And all I did for you is true
And I Iet you lie to me
But these walls won't fall for you

[Bridge]
I'm feeling more lights are going out
Tell me who you wanna be
You're not the person I used to know
But I'm unsure to let you go
There was some more of the truth
I didn't find
And if it's you then it's me
Turn your back

She, she meant
My necessary friend
In need
She'll be there

I don't need a speech
Know you'll never leave, I
Just need your belief, this time
I don't need you to say
Do or die cause anyway
I know that
You'll be there

No sleep, no strings
No sense ending in heartbreak
Trust you, trust me
You'll be there when I'm falling
Cut deep, cutscene
Hold my hand when I'm driving
Just sleep, choose me
Just like back when we started
Just like back when we started
Just like back when we started

(10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

Stay, stay a while
If you've the time
Hold me in
Don't be scared

No sleep, no strings (I don't need a speech)
No sense ending in heartbreak (Know you'll never leave, I)
Trust you, trust me (Just need your belief, this time)
You'll be there when I'm falling
Cut deep, cutscene (I don't need you to say)
Hold my hand when I'm driving (Do or die cause anyway)
Just sleep, choose me (I know that)
You'll be there (Just like back when we started) (10, 9, 8, 7)

I miss you (6, 5)
And we should talk soon (4, 3)
Bye (2, 1)

[Intro]
If you fall, I'll catch you

[Verse 1]
So I've been thinking 'bout something
Lately I've been alive
'Cause I found my reason in nothing
So I won't close my eyes
'Cause I don't want to miss one second
And I don't want to feel so cold
And I don't want to be so sad that we are who we are
'Cause we had no control

[Pre-Chorus]
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame
When we've only ourselves to blame

[Chorus]
So I won't sleep
No more
No, I won't sleep
No more
I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
No more
Like I could always
No DMT won't stop me
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
Dream
No more
(Dream no more)

[Verse 2]
So get this doubt out of my head
It's only real if you let it
And I've been letting go of my ghosts
I'll never let them catch me no more
But these words are all I have
So I'll just keep dreaming out loud
And if I just keep talking
Maybe I'll figure all this out

[Pre-Chorus]
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame
And we've only ourselves to blame

[Chorus]
So I won't sleep
No more
No, I won't sleep
No more
I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
No more
Like I could always
No DMT won't stop me
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
Dream
No more

Breaking through the line
You and I, it's not setting in
Knew I shouldn't but I did
Trying to save what I could't see
These feelings stretch into the mountains
And the sun sets behind it
Took your perspective and I stretched it
You bring out the weakness I'm surpressing
The sea is cold, how did we get here
The world turns away as I kiss you
Something new
Feel the past fade
Everything we once knew
I found myself in this
Waiting, while nothing burns everything
Until everything rises again
No frame for this view
I'm lost down there in the noise just like you
But now I see a yellow dress
My past behind you it so slowly sets

I heard trust doesn't grow it only withers

I told you that we're done, staring at the ceiling from the sky
You forced it out of me, this went much better in my..
I like to be alone
Too much
Some would say
Voices in my head, running relay
Mood Moving like, a ballet duet
Beautiful for you I reckon ...
Beautiful for you I reckon

Watching till the concrete sets in...

I used to want it all
I laugh about it now
Scared to lose the light when it's fading
Now I dance in the darkness
Can't you see me I'm up (I'm up)
Watch you fade away
The fuck I'm reaching for when it stays here
Minutes from nowhere

Uhhh...

For now, you're feeling waves
Look, no nothing's saved
Still I'm losing time
Keep tryna hit play
Felt light climbing
Capsizing
Dark shadows on my silver lining
Just me now
I turn away from
Fuck I'm selfish init
I know you think it
But still you
Fell for me, fell for me, fell for me
I got nothing else, but you're still with me, still with me, still with me
Heard that a boy drowned .....
Screamed it all but no sound
Hit something must be the ground
I'm Falling through and I'm jaded...
Blue lights but they're late
Eyes glazed, I won't change
Walk through myself in this maze
How did you get here, I'm amazed

Said it at the same time
Running on some lost time
Pushing through the headlights

Who you gonna be now...

I be making waves, as I'm reaching for the next sky
Everything, everything I done prayed
She could never see it in the same light
I'ma stay here til the sun up
I'ma be here one more night
Ain't breathed out in a couple years
And I'm finna move back to the west side
She gone play like it ain't me
The silence heavy till we catch eye
Need to keep going till I'm back home
Until I start thinking about next time

Next time...

Yo
Thing is I don't really care that much anymore
Don't swear that much anymore
Don't text back much anymore
I'm Just calm, don't really care for
Anything much
I let it fall
I turn around
It's all behind glass
What's even yours
She say she mine
I've heard that all before

Your words perfectly chosen
You were so closed
You were open to me
Lights off but it's open
That long hall
To the trenches
Sky falls
And I bench it .........

I don't really care that much anymore
Don't swear that much anymore
Don't text back much anymore

I'm Just calm, don't really care for
Nothing much, I let it fall
I turn around
It's all behind glass
Watch it fall (What?)
What's even yours

Yours words perfectly chosen
You were so closed
You were open to me
Lights off but it's open
That long hall
To the trenches
The sky falls
And I bench it .........

Sky falls and I bench it

Pushed you away and blame you
What an easy lie
Zoomed out to the truth
Don't believe what u hear
Walls closing in on this booth

[Intro: ATO]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Her eyes are to the camera
She tryna find her way to the other side
She tryna find the answer
To the good life
The more money, she's addicted to the money tree
And she don't know who she can be
She tryna find herself inside of me, yeah
And if she wants to go alone, we can play that game
She done it once before, but it's never been the same
She's afraid of change, I don't know why

[Verse 1: ATO]
Popping more than bottles
Just a couple homeless models
On a red-eye from Atlanta
Drinking wine until it landed
She's tryna be more than twisted panties on this bedroom floor
Heart set on dior
Alexander Wang, she wants it all
Told her now
"Keep the lights off, love the dark
Take the tights off, if you want me come and get me
You ain't going home tonight."
Feeling the emotions, got the motion running double time
Seeing double, wondering which girl is coming home with me tonight

[Chorus: EDEN]
And I got a notion
Everything's going fine
'Cause we stand for nothing
And they say that faith is blind
And it's always brighter on the other side
It's a fine line
Between bliss and open eyes

[Verse 2: ATO]
Fuck the system, more controversial than collaborating two religions
Remain the realest in the building
Under these conditions I've been kicking since my time was ticking
And without a finish line, how can I now define winning?
Looking major, but fuck your pen and fuck your paper
And if it compromises mine, the only sign is that I shouldn't sign
Sharp shadows circles 'round my spine
Only friend is time this time like every time before
Just like her, I'm proudly putting London on the map
Don't hold me back, scream up West, where my motherfuckers at?
[?]
Hypocrisy that exists among these cold rappers, it's an epidemic of Y.M.C.M.B
Can't fuck with me though
I'm trying to take your girl, yes, Childish Gambino
I hold my chest knowing the bullets for my head and ego
I'm at the edge screaming, "Don't hold me back," while the ledge breaks
And I feel no weight as I make this great escape
You know I'm hating on these rappers
I don't feel these rappers
Some of them are real but most are sour sweets beneath the wrapper
Feeling poor, but rest assured I'm bringing something new
Hear the game's broken, I'm reminded that its rent is due
I've got it all, down to the last penny
Down to the last depressive night alone drinking Henny
I keep it real to me, you know what's real to me is real for you
Writing like tomorrow will never come true at ten to midnight
I'm rolling over, twenty now and I'm killing
Thirty-two bars a minute but guarantee your mind will still be ticking
When I'm finished going over ninety miles per hour
Burning through this track gaining more flack than Dwight Howard
I don't trust her, trust breaks in a second
Love used as a weapon was never what we intended
But don't forget, now that it's been addressed
It's what we don't do, not what we do, we ultimately regret

[Alan Watts - What If Money Was No Object]
You will spend your life completely wasting your time
You will be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living - that is to go on doing things you don't like doing
Which is stupid
Better to have a short life full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way

[Unnamed housewife]
I can't tell you about it
If you can't see it, then you'll never know it
I feel sorry for you


[Verse 1]
You been confusing since the day I met you
Another night chasing, this feels like home
Since I've been miles away, no change
Outsider inside looking dazed
Just wash the glitter off your face and go home
Winter sun throwing shadows long and lonesome
How strange to think that we were strangers once
At square one
I guess it's on me, I want more than I've got
But I can't ask you for the things you don't feel
Don't-

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
I don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles, or favors
And I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say, yeah

[Chorus]
And I'll still be there
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
'Cause I've got nowhere else, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she told me love me fast but take it slow
I said I'm going nowhere fast as hell
And keeping with the times we gotta keep it on the low
Midnight habits burning through the summer since the snow, and
I finally feel myself again
It's been so long, I thought I'd seen the end
But I guess you need ends to begin again
And again, and again
'Cause this is nothing we ain't seen before
I lived through it, I ain't overdosed
The sky is falling like it always does
So I guess we'll see if someone's watching over us
So let it rain
The clouds look heavy, but they bear no weight
The scars can't hurt you and the bruises will fade, yes


[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
I don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles, or favors
And I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

[Chorus]
And I'll still be there
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
'Cause I've got nowhere else

[Outro]
And I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
I don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles, or favors
And I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say, yeah

You've been confusing since the day I met you
Another night chasing, this feels like home
Since I've been miles away from change
Outside or inside looking dazed
Just wash the glitter off your face and go home

And this enthralling shadow's gone, ghost town
It's strange to think that we were strangers once
It's square one
I guess it's something where I want more than I've got
But I can't ask you for the things you don't feel

Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

And I'll still be here
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
Cause I've got no hope

Yeah
She told me love me fast or take it slow
I said I'm going nowhere fast as hell
And keeping with the times we gotta keep it on the low
Midnight habits burning through the summer since the snow and
I finally feel myself again
It's been so long, I thought I'd see the end
I guess you need ends to begin again
Again, again


Cause this is nothing we ain't seen before
Lived through it I ain't overdosed
The sky is falling like it always does
Can't you see a storm's watching over us
Let it rain
The clouds look heavy, but they bare no weight
Scars can't hurt you, bruises will fade

Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

And I'll still be here
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
Cause I've got no hope

Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

[Spoken Word]
We're just veering, backwards at times, just to get through some of the stuff, and it's just crazy, all the things that we have to do, uh, it's just crazy
We're gonna keep going, and, see what happens
Thanks for following along
We still remain optimistic, and are, persevering towards our-

[Chorus]
Dancing on my own
My feet are drawn to you
And lost at every sound
My heart can't fade it

[Verse 1]
Mama said, "Why you gotta waste my time?"
I threw it to the wind, no line
It's something that I need, no crime
The call can't reconnect this time and
The substances we craved subsided
I never want to live half sided, no

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
But still I persist on
I feel like we're orphaned
My halo got all bent
I hate how I feel and
I'm not falling
But I say nothing
I say nothing

[Bridge]
No, I can't believe you wanted me
I cannot see the lining here
I fall asleep to sounds of dreams of you
You're losing me, losing me
Don't lose me
Don't lose grip on me
Feelings down on me
Heart beatdown on me
On me, on me

[Verse 3]
Staring at the screen but I feel no way
Bleeding through to real life, fucking up the wave
I can make you feel but could never make you stay
What do you want from me?
What do I hope to see?
I haven't been home in weeks

[Break]
Still, I can feel loved for now
And I can accept the paths I've taken
And if all this dies out I'll be good
Still, I'm down and

[Chorus]
Dancing on my own
My feet are drawn to you
And lost at every sound
My heart can't fade it

[Verse]
Just a little bit more, bite the bullet before
It was written on the back of the bedroom door
And it will keep going and the world still turns
If it's easier said than done, I'm sure
These things that been pullin' me in
But I begin to break the hold
There it goes

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know you anymore
But did I ever, maybe never saw through
Just an idea, just an idea

[Chorus]
And I know that this projection has been slipping away
Building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up

Just an-

[Verse]
Never break
When I bring it to the brink
When I bring it never bright
When I bring it to the brink
Then I bring it right back
When I bring it to the brink
And I see it, never break
When I see it, never saw it, 'til I bring it to the break

[Verse]
Just a little bit more, bite the bullet before
It was written on the back of the bedroom door
And it will keep going and the world still turns
If it's easier said than done, I'm sure
These things that been pullin' me in
But I begin to break the hold
There it goes

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know you anymore
But did I ever, maybe never saw through
Just an idea, just an idea

[Chorus]
And I know that this projection has been slipping away
Building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up

...I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up
I'm building it up, I'm building it up

[Verse]
Never break
When I bring it to the brink
When I bring it never bright
When I bring it to the brink
Then I bring it right back
When I bring it to the brink
And I see it, never break
When I see it, never saw it, 'til I bring it to the break
When I'm out
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes, and it goes

[Verse]
Touch me and slip away
I can't hide feeling out of place
I can't function, oh my mistake
Thought you were someone I once knew

[Chorus]
I was light years ahead of me
Thoughts in my head don't disappear
I was a maybe (A maybe)
That made you the truth

[Refrain]
In time I will come to see it for how it really was
In my mind, it's only false faces whisper, "Love you"
If that feeling had a price then I would gladly pay it over and over and over 'til I'm broke
And if you held me for ransom I'd love it, I'd never wanna go home
But all this hypothetical thinking is digging me down (Down)
And maybe I was seconds away but it doesn't matter now
Heat death only seconds away, so no, it don't matter now

[Verse]
Touch me and slip away
I can't hide feeling out of place
I can't function, oh my mistake
Thought you were someone I once knew, woah, yeah

[Chorus]
There's light years ahead of me
Voices in my head don't disappear
I was a maybe (A maybe)
That made you the truth

[Refrain]
In time I will come to love it for how it really was
In my mind, it's only false faces whisper, "See you"
If that feeling had a price then I would gladly pay it over and over and over 'til I'm broke
And if you held me for ransom I'd love it, I'd never wanna go home
But all this hypothetical thinking is digging me down, down
And maybe I was seconds away but it doesn't matter now
Heat death only seconds away, so no, it don't matter now

[Verse 1: ATO]

And now you're questioning the decisions I'm making lately
Said that's rich coming from someone who barely gave me a penny
If you were here you'd understand my reflection
'Cause standing over there gives you an ill-informed perception

Of who I am, who I'm meant to be and the couches between
'Cause when you wake up is when I'll be living the dream
I've embarked upon this journey alone
Now I'm four years within the unknown but yet so lyrically grown

Shit
How did my life become like this
It's all a puzzle, drinking, I can find the answer in the bottom of this bottle
Life's a struggle
So we work just to work more
One the last floors has us falling through a thousand more
When the rich take less to the grave than the poor

My mum's calling my phone and I'm on the road
I take the call, she's low, saying she's been diagnosed
With the same shit that had me wear a black suit and tie
When my mother's mother said goodbye back in '99

There's a thin line between love and hate
And I see people cross the border every day
And I see people hustling to find change
In the pursuit to find change

All I know is
Ato, come home
Ato ain't ready, Ato needs to get more
The hourglass's pressure ain't resistant
Thoughts of pessimism
Despite all these feelings be the rhythm to the way I'm living

And if you find a diamond in the dirt
A broken bridge by a river, or a sinner by a church
Trust I know life is too short
To not give time to a possibility without hope

[Chorus]

Young guy, you don't know why
Living in the city where they leave you by the roadside
All I know in the place where I've grown is
I don't wanna be like him

Young guy, you don't know why
Living in the city where they leave you by the roadside
All I know in the place where I've grown is
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna

[Verse 2: ATO]

Think about you, drink about you
I tried with you, but you pushed me away
Way deeper into yesterday
Hold up where you going, you best not be playing games
One fight away from changing this picture inside this frame

See when you go is not back to my usual
Young artistic nigga in the city with that pencil full of pain
Into walking in the rain
And the raindrops they fall heavy for me
It's funny, feel like it's Gods way of tryna speak to me

Well that's what I feel
Feel what I imagine is real
Just a flower in this field
Tryna find my way between
The pretty lady's finger and thumb
And she's God
Cause she controls the feelings I've got

But I've got so much on my brain these days
I feel the waves getting far too big to handle
[Fail] to turn this shit the other way
Sail back to the harbor like your average Joe and play it safe
But that's not life it's not what I chose

The Romans made these roads that I refuse to follow populated with people that don't see past the tip of their nose
In the process lost a place called home
Lost myself
Lost my girl
Feel as if I'm alone staring at the park

There's a billion people that feel the same
Life is how you see it and I see it as a frame
The picture that it holds becomes clear on your final days
Pray it's never my choice to choose to give the brush away

[Chorus: ATO]

Young guy, you don't know why
Living in the city where they leave you by the roadside
All I know in the place where I've grown is I don't wanna be like him

Young guy, you don't know why
Living in the city where they leave you by the roadside
All I know in the place where I've grown is
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna

[Verse 3: ATO]

That's when I realized I'd rather have real enemies than fake friends
Be true to me than lying cheating on Sunday, say Amen
I keep spinning the world on the tip of my fingers
[Stressing] the waves
Causing tsunamis
Killing them masses
Watching em pray
Twenty four hours a day

Just to test em
If I stop it, wonder who calls it a blessing
Wonder who sees the disaster
Wonder who can see the lesson
But my left hand keeps on spinning it
I'm out of control
My eyes reflecting the cadence with no intention to close

And now you're questioning the decisions I'm making lately
Said that's rich coming from someone who barely gave me a penny
If you were here you'd understand my reflection
Cause standing over there gives you an ill informed perception
Of who I am, who I'm meant to be, and the couches between
Cause when you wake up is when I'll be living the dream

(Ato, have you been up all night?)

[2015]
And if these days were living encores, encore
Then and tell me, do you scream?
Even when every thing's a nightmare
It's something we've all seen
'Cause we let everyone we love fall down
Like a lead sky brings the night
And that's all we are
'Cause we get off on hiding everything we are
So tell me you love me
I will too
So tell me you loath me
I do too

[2011]
And I been thinking that
The more I grow
The more that I'll lose touch with what I love, and time it flows
So much faster than anything I've ever known
I've always been a dreamer
So what happens when I wake up?
I'm not afraid of growing older
I'm just afraid of letting go

[2017]
Um, I usually write a poem for each body of work I do
Or just randomly too, I guess
But yeah, here it is:
Stop
You are not broken
There is no fix
There is a change
You are not your job, your significant other, the numbers in your bank account, the thoughts or the memories in your head
What ever anyone says: whatever
You are the words you speak, the way you move
This can change at any time as you decide
Choose wisely
Does your love mean anything if I can't feel it?
If I threw myself off a building am I a martyr or a tragedy?
However you may feel momentarily, only two factors persevere:
Your relationship to the people around you, and your view of yourself
You could buy that x if you wanted to
But think about it, if you came home like you did would it change a thing?
You are inconstant, dynamic
You're a star darling, act like one
Take care of the ones that you love
Stop being so serious
Now is not forever
But you knew all this, deep down
Maybe we are forever ending where we started
But it is only the end if you want it to be
Everything is only ever what you would like it to be;
Never as great or as grave as it seems
No matter how close or how impossibly far you think you got to that greener grass
We just have to try again
We just have to try again

[Music video intro]
I don't know, I just remember being so much brighter.... I guess
Yeah, it's a weird thing, like, I don't know hehe uhm... I definitely feel like I'm at the beginning of all this and I want it to be really beautiful uhm, and I guess that's the best way to look at it. Just take it


[Verse 1]
So tell me this is who you are
They tell me I've got something more
And oh, "you could be loved"
But I don't want the lights to find me when I'm dark and lost
But never on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna swing like Sinatra
Singing like I can't stop
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I just wanna live like the ones before, yeah
And maybe I could play guitar like Hendrix
Or save the world or end it
And then maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
That's all I want

[Verse 2]
So I got ten minutes to be all or nothing to
Whoever wants to hear
And I got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat 'till I'm burnt out and disappear
But I owe you nothing
And I own my luck
Oh, they said "you'll never be alone again"
But I don't think you understand me or what I fear
"But you could be loved"
But I don't wanna lie to tell myself
I'm more than all the mistakes I've outrun

[Verse 3]
'Cause I'm only here for a minute
And I don't care what you say 'cause I know
You're only here 'cause I'm winning
But I can be my own kind of rock and roll
I don't really care if you say you don't fuck with me
And I can say what the fuck I want 'cause it's down to me
And I got love for you even if you are doubting me
Like, oh my God, I just can't stop

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna sing like Sinatra
With ethanol my soundtrack
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I wonder how it feels to burn out young, yeah
'Cause I just wanna die before my heart fails
From heartbreak or cocktails and
Then maybe you'll cry once you know I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
Oh, that's all I want, yeah

[Bridge]
'Cause I ain't scared of livin'
Does it get easier?
No... yes, it gets easier
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Oh yeah?
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Look at you

[Outro]
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll - that's all I want
'Cause it's all we've got
What are we breathin' for if we ain't living?
What's under the words you know - that's all I want
And I don't want your love
I just wanna feel like I'm still livin'
Something more than superficial is all I want
And if there is no god
I know the day I die, I lived through heaven
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll - that's all I want
And that I gave it hell
And if it hurt, oh well
At least that's living
The more you know who you are and what you want...
That's all I want
...the less you let things upset you
That's all I want
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be, you know?
I tried being a writer but I hate what I write
And I tried taking pictures but they were so mediocre
You know, and every girl goes through a photography phase
You know, like horses, you know, take, uh, dumb pictures of your feet
You'll figure that out - I'm not worried about you

[Extended]
If all we had is time then we'll be alright
It's not much but it's better than nothing
Sex, drugs and rock and roll that's all I want
What's under the words you know that's all I want
Something more than superficial is all I want
Sex, drugs and rock and roll that's all I want


[Verse 1]
Speaking of another life
I can't unfold our
Heartbreak from another time
Four seconds too long
In my head I get caught, I suppose
Just wishing I won't let her mind
Alright

[Pre-Chorus]
So we can fly away
Wondering way out loud 'till my thoughts say so
Just to ride the wave
I think I move too fast, enough to take it slow

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, running, tripping
I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
But maybe I'll get somewhere, fast, fast

[Verse 2]
'Cause speaking of another lie, just to make times last
'Cause speaking of another love died, all just typecast
Say I fall in love too fast
For my own good
Good, good, good


[Pre-Chorus]
We can run away
I'll move 'till I die, enough to take it slow
Just to ride the wave
We're moving too fast, enough to take

[Chorus]
'Cause I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, running
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
But maybe I'll get somewhere, fast, fast

[Verse 1]
So rushing in and rushing out again
Another martyr anon
So you can wake up and start again
From stardust to god
And maybe in another man's life
On another man's time
Maybe the time's just not right for us
Maybe this is all that we are, are

[Chorus]
The lives I've loved
Too close to know
The hindsight song
There's no way I'd rather wait than know

[Verse 2]
The highs we trade for the lows
Just gotta wake up and start again
'Cause this is no place like home
And if you could've stayed there you would've
Could've, should've
Another life I had known
Maybe the time would be right for us
But this is all that we got
Our luck

[Chorus]
The lives I've loved
And too close to know
Chasing, but at what cost?
Just 'cause there's no way I'd rather wait than know?


[Verse 1]
And I said what's up?
What you been thinking?
'Cause you've been staring at that roof so long
I'd swear it's come alive
And she spoke nine words
And now we're sinking
But I can't find it in myself to want to lie
To keep this thing from going down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that girl took my heart
And I ain't want it back
No
I'm laying down my cards

[Verse 2]
'Cause you said it meant nothing
And I should've kept my silence
But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know
That all these words meant nothing
And I've always been this heartless
And we're just having sex, no, I would never call it love
But love

[Chorus]
Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?


[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
So I guess it's
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
Let die to let live

[Verse 3]
And what's good
When both choices I've got
Have us staring down the barrel to the bullets I can't stop?
And so I stand off
Like indecision's Kevlar
'Til this fear of feeling stops and I'm done
But you

[Interlude]
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you

[Pre-Chorus]
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
'Cause that girl took my heart
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
And I ain't want it back, no
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
A bulletproof restart


[Chorus]
Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
So I guess it's
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
Let die to let live

[Outro]
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you

[Chorus]
But baby, it's cold outside, I don't wanna go
Rushing thoughts to the back of my mind
From the end of the road

[Verse]
Always thought I'd find peace in that life
Now I've nowhere to go
Chasing shadows across those blue skies, my heroes
We'll watch the radio blur
As my hands move fast to the mirror
Been fighting off cold sweats
And waking up soaked again
I couldn't fake it if I tried
I couldn't fake it if I
If I-

[Chorus]
'Cause baby it's cold outside, I don't wanna go
Rushing thoughts to the back of my mind
From the end of the world, woah

[Outro]
Look, baby, I gotta go
'Cause I'm dying for it
So If you love me don't let me go
'Cause I'm dying for it
If you love me don't let me go
'Cause I'm dying for it
If you love me don't let me go
'Cause I'm-

[Intro: I Have A Dream]

I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history...

[Verse 1: ATO]

I guess it's okay
Not to be okay
You walk by the sea in a hope to get washed away
And not wake again to the same pain that you felt yesterday
And the day before
Man that's deep
But even your friends don't know how deep it is
Until they're burying a body six feet in shit

Uh, yeah
Life is about that love
Life is about that person
Who's all that you need and want
It's funny how my darkest moment
Brought my mom and dad to speak
I could look at that in either way
But what's the point, I'll leave it be

I'm just tryna find positives in these negatives
And now I know why they taught us maths in school
Cause when you add it all up maths is all that we do
I just need time
To figure my self out
Add a few things in
Subtract a few things out

Life has just been complicated
For me and all those who can relate this
This is more than just money issues
I'm talking picking up mummy's tissues
So what do they know about me
What do they know about me
On the low
But they seem to say a lot and I'm hearing things I didn't know

[Refrain: ATO]

I'm just sat in a field
One drunk man walking past but he can't see me
Sun retreats and gives way to the stars
I'm just looking for something different

Just sat in a field
Walking past he can't see me
Sun retreats and gives way to the stars
I'm just looking for something different

[Verse 2: ATO]

RIP
To Maddie, Ben and the Akash's fathers
It's down to you, that I've been speaking to mine and trying harder
I feel like I'm deep
But I wanna be deeper
My mum's tellin' me that I should find a girl
But I haven't found myself and It's getting darker


I found something in Paris
Something I don't wanna see again
The coldest of people
Early smiles are often deceitful
I'm so grateful
I didn't grow up in Chelsea
I don't know about those silver spoons or the other side of that Bentley

People would try and sell your dreams
Don't believe them
Until you see that
And your bank account feel that

People would try and sell your dreams
Don't believe them
Until you see that
And your bank account feel that

[Refrain: ATO]

I'm just sat in a field
One drunk man walking past but he can't see me
Sun retreats and gives way to the stars
I'm just looking for something different

Just sat in a field
One drunk man walking past he can't see me
Sun retreats and gives way to the stars
I'm just looking for something different tonight

[Outro: I Have A Dream]

We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism...

[Intro]
What the fuck is in the end when there ain't peace?

[Verse 1]
Waste time, the time's never right (uh)
The pink like, speedlight, crash 25
Have me think twice in this black, white (okay)
Rewind, silence echos to our last night
Watch the sky fall (fall), drown in the city of sin
The devil sleeps light where the river bends
Tried to hold my breath, you brought up '94
Pullin' off the M-Way, kicking out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Skate all these walls and these ceilings you brining
I feel these people wanna try and take the light out of me
Take the dark out of me
I'm so alive, made you feel alive
You can't define me

[Chorus]
All sold out of paradise
You shoulda stuck around
And the sun don't set on the rest of us (yeah)
Heard you got to thinking you're god now, poor soul (poor soul)
I pour that shit all over the ace (ace)


[Verse 2]
This time was too close (too close)
Now we're both unafraid to lose it all (yeah)
My head light, feel the lights goin'
She loved you but couldn't see where the light falls
Follow the blue, time, blue
Her world upside down tryna shake the truth
Feel a wave, waves, it's the same, same
Will I ever change?
Burning through this paper
I'll make it all back later
I'll turn out just like you, before it's done we should make up
Oh god damn
From the day, from the jump, from the outside, been some outliers, raised in the riots
Heard they looking for something, nothing or something
Are you here for the Truman Show
This way for

[Pre-Chorus]
I skate all these walls and these ceilings you brining
I feel these people wanna try and take the light out of me
Take the dark out of me
I'm so alive, made them feel alive
They can't hold me if I lose myself
How far the fuel goes, I keep the lights low
Follow the white lines through the dark night and to the devils eyes, shadow of moonlight
Good morning


[Chorus]
All sold out of paradise
You shoulda stuck around
And the sun don't set on the rest of us
Heard you got to thinking you're god now, poor soul
I pour that shit all over the- fucks sake

[Verse 3]
Who do you think you are?
Passenger side of a fast car
Halfway between two roads
Used to be scared of the blue, like I was fallin' through now I'm just numb to the pain
Sometimes I wonder if I'm losing myself
But tell me whats to lose when my wrist is on loop
Take time, don't move and watch it all rush back
Guess this is who I'm gonna be
Everything barely underneath my feet
They used to tell me "Ato just breathe"
Tried to get off the train while it was moving
Look to my eyes, couldn't see what I see
Embarrassed at how I feel
Such a big deal, all in my head
Like what even is the truth

[Outro]
Right, right now
Right now
Right, right now
Right now
Right, right now
Right now
Right, right now
Right now

What the fuck is in the-

Watch you fall in love with the other side

Bare shy when you met me for the first time
I just watched your city turn into the sky
Didn't feel the moment until it landed though
Something great out there
You saw it on my mind
Used to be my world now you're a distant star
Obsessed with the past but you ain't finished living
Coz everything and nothing as we're zooming out
Everything is nothing when I close my eyes

She's breathing like she wanna say something
I hear your thoughts
Running, tripping n falling
Only to afford me a lie
Twenty more minutes almost missed my flight..

24 of life
25 and breathe
Could have been more but we couldn't see
Ayo Ayo..

Falling further into the sky
Through these fears. I'm feeling alive
There's a feeling I can't shake
Falling in Circles
In Circles

It's just us in the backroom
25 nights
Us in the purple fire fucking up the mood
Try and hold paradise
Missed it by design
Yeah I have feelings that you never took right
Ye you could be my girl and we could run the night..

Think about it
I feel alive
Killing time

You're never far from anything (1-2 Yeah)
You make waves just to feel alive
This smile runs deeper than you
But I think I like you more than the last time..

So maybe we should go out
Lost track of time
Made me a little late
Got a flight in the morning but that can fucking wait
When I leave, turn ghost, I'll be back again
I like this
I know you feel the same
See you in London
That's the second date
Zooming out two times on a new frame
My nigga's on fire and it's all pain
How am I gonna rush what I can't say
Rain on my window made me think again
Letting go
And let it all fall again
It's always...

24 of life
25 and breathe
Could have been more but we couldn't see
Ayo Ayo

Falling further into the sky
Through these fears. I'm feeling alive
There's a feeling I can't shake
Falling in Circles
In Circles

It's just us in the backroom
25 nights
Us in the purple fire fucking up the mood
Try and hold paradise
Missed it by design
Yeah I have feelings that you never took right
Ye you could be my girl and we could run the night..

Think about it
I feel alive
Killing time

[Verse 1]
You try to kill it but it won't stop bleeding
Try to forget it but it won't stop killing you
You're running out of time
Yeah, you know you can't go back
It's too late
To say it's too late
You can't take back that you said nothing
How could you do nothing?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this burning right?
Am I living bridges?
Can we build our past right?
Learning through future solecism

[Chorus 1]
(I've missed times) It's played out
(Been disconnected) I've moved on
(I stressed time) Get fucked up
(Forgetting timing) My new draw
(And I need you to talk me down) And it's not right
You're dead wrong ('cause I feel like I need to crash)
What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong

[Bridge]
'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong
Been looking at the sky like someone was looking down
But it keeps raining on me
And I've been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old
Been looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone
And the fault's not ours alone
But I think it's time to go

[Chorus 2 (Over Bridge)]
It's played out
I've moved on
Get fucked up
My new draw
And it's not right
You're dead wrong
What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong

[Verse 2]
And I've got way too many questions just to try and get it right
'Cause I can't be the one to shrug it off
And I could be the reason that we stay up all night
To be someone, to be someone
And oh, all we've got is to try to get it right
But no one told you
That this gon' hurt, oh no
And now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream

[Verse 3]
That shit just to try and find a way to get my head down
And head out or maybe just the two of us and head now
I'm just tryna find the real now
Dream clouds, ghost ground
Real friends, dead hometown

[Bridge]
'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong
Been looking at the sky like someone was looking down
But it keeps raining on me
When I been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old
Been looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone
And it breaks my heart, you know
But I think it's time to go

[Chorus 2 (Over Bridge)]
It's played out
I've moved on
Get fucked up
My new draw
And it's not right
You're dead wrong
What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong

[Verse]
Shuffle in the dark
I'm throwing out parts and time
Is always changing
Particles spin down
Separated lust, yeah
Couple seconds up
You want something that ain't coming back to that
But it really don't matter how bad you want me
How you found me
I can't keep up with/afford just being a static
Design

[Verse 1]
Uh
My heart yearns for escape
I spoke my truth, until it turned me away
You're talking about some feelings you've been holding for months
Had me question myself, and had me question your trust

I took a prick from that rose
These words got me thinking about the nights we were close
They wanna hear me rap from the depths of my soul
But I'm about to blow a bag and fill it with clothes

I heard they looking for that new ambition
Well all my brothers in the new editions
Stepping out, you looking at us different
Louis Vuitton, he wants some new religions

I paint this world black from the inside
They just want to hear this from the inside
More life, more lights, feel the moments, if I try
I ain't feeling myself
'Till we make it two five

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm fine, I'm nice like that
You know those nights like that
You feel those blinds go back
You feel the lights go black

You know those nights like that
I get those Nikes like that
Feel God on nights like this
I need those nights like that

I got a feeling that I know how you feel like
I'ma take a trip, but I'll be yours for the meanwhile
Fallen out of love, two times
But that's alright
We can go all night, no lie

[Chorus]
And Its okay, I don't mind
You can't hit the rewind
Fallen 'bout 4 or 5 times
I'm still running away from it (Sundown)
It's okay, I don't mind
You can't hit the rewind
Fallen 'bout 4 or 5 times
I'm still running away

[Verse 2]
30 floors, the closest edge
Take in this city
Hold my breath

Breaking family ties
How many times, we gon' lose this light
Give me a sign, feeling the pressure rise
Through this breeze
Held up the skies to find the strength to believe
Should've been my big brother, but he looked over me

How should I feel about the way that ended
Guess If my brother said it
I shouldn't second guess it?

I'm tryna re-imagine God like Nietzsche
I lost my way to find my only believer
The music just a vehicle for my subconscious
My mother says she love when my smile frames my demeanor

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm fine, I'm nice like that
You know those nights like that
You feel those blinds go back
You feel the lights go black

You know those nights like that
I get those Nikes like that
Feel God on nights like this
I need those nights like that

I got the feelings, that I know how you feel like
I'ma take a trip, but I'll be yours for the meanwhile
Fallen out of love, two times
But that's alright
We can go all night, no lie

[Chorus]
And Its ok I don't mind
You can't hit the rewind
Fallen bout 4 or 5 times
I'm still running away from it (Sundown)
It's ok, I don't mind
You can't hit the rewind
Fallen bout 4 or 5 times
I'm still running away

[Intro]
I got a feeling last night
You were on your way over
Walking the line of the cracks in the road
If I had thought to read the signs
I could've maybe bought time
But now you keep your leaking eyes to the floor
Collider feel
I'm running, keep my lines on track
And pushing through
Said you'd never come back

[Verse]
But don't you want to watch it die?
Collapse in for you now
I'm pulling the time back (Time)
I just want to watch it die
Can't stop now anyway
Can't shake the thought of
When I close my eyes you're

[Chorus]
Walking out the door, ooh (I still see you)
Know you needed something more (I see you see through me)
Walking out the door, ooh (I wish you said it to me)
Know you needed something more (I)

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna watch it die
Can't stop now anyway
Can't shake the thought of
When I close my eyes you're

[Chorus]
Walking out the door, ooh-ooh-ooh (I still see you)
Know you needed something more (I see you see through me)
Walking out the door, ooh (I wish you said it to me)
Know you needed something more (I wish you said it to me)

[Verse]
Don't you want to watch it die?
Collapse in for you now (I wish you said it to me)
I- I'm pulling the time back (I wish you said it to me)
I just want to watch it die
Can't stop now anyway
Can't shake the thought of
When I close my eyes you're (I wish you said it to me)

[Verse 1: Crywolf]
I felt a break in a sacred place
Where your hands don't heal
These are the reasons you're ruled
By the things you feel

Out of  the deep waters and all their intricacies
This is the real face of all your enemies

[Verse 2: Crywolf]
I felt you escape into empty space
Where my heart can't feel
Down in that darkness
You met all the things you feared

And I knew
I knew there was nothing I could do

[Chorus: Crywolf]
Could you stomach it, anymore?
Could you stand to be a breath away?
Can you feel the way your face distorts?
Did you think that it could be this way?

I can hear you from behind the door
I can feel you from a mile away
As you're growing out of my control
Will you watch me as I fade away?

[Verse 3: EDEN]
You can't escape forever
Mistaking smoke for heaven's light
It's not follow or a fade to black and white

Oh, I could take you home
Pretend the best's still ahead
Maybe in the sun, you'll see
You got what you want, but not what you need

[Interlude: Crywolf]
If I'm afraid
Then you are the darkness that made me feel this way

[Chorus: Crywolf & EDEN]
Could you stomach it, anymore?
Could you stand to be a breath away?
Can you feel the way your face distorts?
Did you think that it could be this way?

I can hear you from behind the door
I can feel you from a mile away
As you're growing out of my control
Will you watch me as I fade away?

[Outro: Crywolf]
Bless my darkness, bless my light
I lost my soul in your skin tones, now
Bless my darkness, bless my light
I lost my soul in your skin tones, now
Bless my darkness, bless my light
I lost my soul in your skin tones, now

[Verse 1]
Yeah, how could you be so careless?
I sweat this, I swear
I think I'm losing my voice, I took no time to take care
I smashed my phone, but honestly
I feel relieved you can't reach me
Now I can exhale on my own

[Chorus]
What were you thinking? That night was a dream
At the top of your lungs, I've heard you scream in your sleep
And I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation
So, how much is enough gonna take? Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I got a number for you
I call it breaking, yeah
I've got a lover, baby
Don't need what you're giving me
More than what you think
Oh, love ain't love if it ain't rough
But, you're screaming

[Verse 2]
I've said it all
(Daydream of nights, sin and saviours)
I thought maybe you'd believe me 'cause I don't
(I saw a light at the end)
These days it's a cliche, I know
(And who am I supposed to be now?)
I have no words, no words
(It's ending)


[Bridge]
And if I could forget you, you know I would leave
I can't help myself from feeling all this is wasted on me
And I love the rain (love!), but I can't live in a storm
I've got more to come
Still learning to grow

[Chorus]
What were you thinking? That night was a dream
At the top of your lungs, I hear you screaming, no sleep
And I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation
So, how much is enough gonna take?
I got a lifetime to wait
Seconds can't bury me

[Verse]
A smell of gas in the smoking room
If I ignore it tell me you will too
House on fire, it's just me and you
Lend me your light, I'll ignite the fumes
On your couch a week or two
True care, I'd do the same for you
I'll be on my feet, said they would call me soon
For now smoke up and inhale the view

[Chorus]
It's all gone up
I sift through the ashes
I don't know what I'm even looking for
Some kind of evidence
(All that's left is paperwork)
(All that's left is the blue and white)
(All that's left misremembered words)
(All that's left is the flashing lights)
It's all burned out
And I search for the answer
I don't know what I should be looking for
Some kind of medicine

[Post-Chorus]
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it

[Chorus]
It's all gone up
I sift through the ashes
I don't know what I'm even looking for
Some kind of evidence
It's all gone up
It's all gone up
Medicine

[Post-Chorus]
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it
(I need you)
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it
I've been trying to tell you something
I can't find the way to say it
I need you

[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was 'em bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 1]
See my momma cry too many tears
And we been broke like too many years
It ain't too many kids, a couple homies, there ain't too many there
And they all gotta eat, they got too many kids
Too many kids with no fathers, doing too many bids
Too many bids, judge gave them kids too many years
As soon as you get that money, that's as soon they appear
Assuming you 'em  owe something, they assuming you'll share
And yeah, I've been losin' touch with my family, it ain't the same
I should've gave my sister some money, but I made it rain
I should've hit the crib with my son and played a game
But instead I ended up at the jeweller to make a chain
It's a sad saying when you make money it make you change
Like four quarters, the fourth quarter, I make a lane
Shit, I had to walk for it they talkin' 'bout takin' trains
And takin' planes, I put the work in and made the name
But the question is

[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was them bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 2]
I never wanted to be like Mike, I wanted to be like Mitch
Now all the lil' niggas wanna be like this
I wear my chain in any city, let you see my shit
Cause I earned that, it's on me, I'mma keep my shit
I got blood on my money, ether in my soul
Do you know the feeling durin' Easter with no clothes?
Now it's stars in the ceiling, bringing ether out the Rolls
With the curtains on the windows, I'm just peekin' at my goals
Money made me iller, already was realer
Young kings killin' young kings over skrilla
That's why I ride around Mac on me like I was Miller
Or Reggie when I shoot for that three
They drop fetty, that's good money
Come to my city, we talk heavy and die young
When we get some paper, we cop Prezis and ride rim
20 inch rims for the dope boy
Sellin' that coke boy, trappin' on your note boy
Got that buy it all money, fuck I need a note for!?
In them school hallways, "fuck I need a note for!?"
We ain't wanna go to class, we was sellin' coke raw
The principal was coppin' too, hit him with a snowball

[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was them bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 3]
Lookin' for the intro
I was at the dealer lookin' for another Benzo
Matching kicks with my Kenzo, young nigga
Heart of a lion, hungry as hippo
When I was on my last, nobody ain't tell me shit though
Flow slicker than Crisco, niggas talkin', I get low
Do my thing, they jump back, know how that shit go
And they say I'm arrogant
I'm still eatin' steak with the asparagus
When I get that money like I married it
1 milly, 2 milly, 3 milly, buried it
Since they say I'm underground, I run that bitch like Harriet
Rolls Royce pushin' real slow like a chariot
Pull up on them niggas that doubted me, shit embarrassin'
I'mma real nigga with money, never cherish it
You a fake niggas with money, it's no comparison
Told me that I couldn't get signed when I was rappin' it
And told me I couldn't do songs when I was battlin'
They told me that I couldn't be trapper, I started trapping' it
Never listen to 'em, oh well, shit is immaculate
I'mma just go sit up in this Bach again
Smoke the weed and laugh at them
Make a couple million by accident
Couple niggas dropped on Twitter, they say they back again
Couple months later on Twitter they say us laxative
Shitted on 'em, Nicki voice, did it on 'em Benjamins
Plently of 'em Benjamins, semi on him and he on a
Whole 'nother level from before now
Tell my niggas when I see a hundred mil its going down
When I made my first mil, I was like "it's on now"
Then I made my second mil, money on the floor now
Then I made my third mil, I'm like "I need more now?"
I got in my zone and that money started pourin' down
Every time I hit the booth, microphone torn down
We couldn't get a pair of Pumas, we up in the store now, bitches!

[Verse 1: Jeremy Zucker]
I was unimportant
You were just a friend
No one even noticed
We would just pretend

[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
But oh god, this sucks
Always, you're thinking too much
Baby, slow down, realize
There's more here for you
You

[Verse 2: Jeremy Zucker]
I was on the border
You were choosing sides
Kiss me in the morning
Miss me in the night

[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
But oh god, we suck
Always, we're thinking too much
Baby, slow down, realize
There's more here for you

[Post-Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
You're thinking too much, baby
(You)
You're thinking too much, baby
(You)
Slow down, take time
You're always thinking too much, baby
(You)
Slow down, realize, yeah realize, yeah

[Bridge: Jeremy Zucker]
Our light is fading
But you look amazing
And my mind is racing
We're all losing patience
I might as well fake it
Since acting's your favorite
Thought this was vacation
I won't keep you waiting
(Won't keep you waiting)

[Verse 3: EDEN & Jeremy Zucker]
We ran in fours to the sunrise
Counting down, come down
Two down in one try
One to go before it burns out
(And my mind is racing)
Past blurs but it's sun drenched
Path turns on its own bent
(We're all losing patience)
Seems less when you know better
And better off for it
(I might as well fake it)
Scarred skies like a road map
One second I thought and I was sure of it
(Since acting's your favorite)
At some point it'll come back
Just don't wait for it
(Thought this was vacation)
At some point, it'll come back
Just don't wait for it
(I won't keep you waiting)

[Outro: Jeremy Zucker]
Won't keep you waiting no more
(What're you doing?)
You're thinking too much, baby


[Verse 1]
Lights dim
Somewhere in the east of the city
These thoughts swim between
Reality and a dream
I just wanna be alone for a minute
I'm just thinking about how I ain't been home for a minute
Thinking like oh my God, this life
She wants more of mine
Uh, I guess you weren't ready for me
I heard most of my past have gone quiet on me
See, drinks with you, became drinks over you
But I think I'm going sober man that shit's over due
Truth is
All my brothers with me are some of the realest
Fearless clearest minded souls ever untold
You must have been mistaken
Don't get it fucked up
Can't afford to get it fucked up right now
Black and white lenses distort the perspective
Promised my mum I'd be back before the end of this sentence

[Chorus]
And we're alright with the darker side
It's inevitable, waiting for a dream
And we're alright with the darker side
It's inevitable, waiting for a dream

[Verse 2]
I tell my story
How dare you tell it for me
I walked into your world, you watched me leave through the other side
She was wishing for more, Channel & Dior
While I was washing my sins in some Dom Perignon
This vertigo got my back up against the views
That I grew in a darkroom
I told you I'd be back before the sun sets
Breaking bread with my flat mates
I'm grounded now I'm over that
Yeah, and now she wants me back
I guess that's only right
She only wants a home at the highest heights
3 and a half thousand miles of perspective
But still couldn't outrun the stars grip of the pencil
I can help you to overcome all your fears
Let them water fall like your tears
Overcome your nightmares for a dream
They say there's no life in the comfort zone
And no life where the cameras go
So where were you when I was coming up
I took my time and in time I trust
If beauty is pain, art is risk, what does that make love
Treading a fine line on my way to God
The path feels straight vertical
Follow the skyscrapers to the place that we've been dreaming of
I promise I won't let you fall this time
Finally satisfied with everything I've left behind

[Chorus]
And we're alright with the darker side
It's inevitable, waiting for a dream
And I'm falling, falling, falling
Will you be there when I can see

[Extra Notes]
I've been rethinking Paris
Everything that happened
I feel apprehensive
Too reach out
And send my blessings
Forget about mishaps
Life's too short
To back track
Looked in your eyes
A hand shake
Over prides back

I've been working hard
In and out of uni
Life's a movie
I just keep it under wraps
And let the music speak for me

This is a part of me
I never started I'll l never finish
Probably die
Half way through a lyric

We're all good till our dreams outgrow our friendship
You didn't share my vision
Its fruition blew your mind
Things change over time
I learnt to embrace that
I can't persuade you to be the friend that you were way back
Your mother had my photo on her fridge
All the years we've missed
I just text you what's been good
Tryna build a bridge
But you ain't tryna cross
Already crossed me off

When they love you for the cold days
I'm still here like always
So caught up in the life style
Reminiscing on the old days

We got it like that
We

Do you love me do you trust me
Told me you don't really know home
Said it ain't the same if I ain't there
My room

[Chorus]
Tide rushing in to me, two me ('Til)
'Til I can breathe easy on my knees ('Til)
Comes falling sins, I've been, been, I been ('Til)
Living easy on my knees, on my-

[Verse]
Concaving in the back
Days slipping through the cracks
Call for you in the back, I'll become stoic if I have to
Royce Rollin' in the back
No phone is now a lux
Heartbreaking in the past on me
On me, on me (Me)

[Bridge]
The still life projections of you (You)
Diffracting through my skull 'til ('Til)

[Chorus]
Tide rushing in to me, two me ('Til)
'Til I can breathe easy on my knees ('Til)
Comes falling sense, I've been, been, I been ('Til)
Living easy on my knees ('Til)

[Outro]
Breathe easy on me, yeah ('Til)
Sleep easy on me, on my-


Young man
Look what you've done
Such a horrible place
All in the name of love

You've been hiding away from us
Caught and choked in the fall, mmm

Young man
Look what you've done
Let it all be for shame
Threw the love away, for what

Many chances came at once
Sold them all for your soul, mmm

I know that I fucked it up
I know I let you down
How can I make it up
To you is it too late now

Too late now, too late now

Old man
Oh, its been rough
These gifts were never wasted
Words kill hesitation once

I rely on the faith too much
Please don't waste your love, please don't waste your love

I know that I fucked it up
I know that I let you down
How can I make it up
To you is it too late now

I know that I fucked it up
I know that I let you down
How can I make it up
To you is it too late now

Too late now, too late now

[Intro]
That's better

[Verse 1]
Heart beat, blunt feel, can't sleep
Cold, but it's still burning
Your precious time wasting, on me

[Pre-Chorus]
So why you gotta drag me?
I've been in a hole since like last week
And I'm holding on, I've held on
I'm holed up

[Chorus]
'Cause you love in
You love in, streams
Seasonal life bringer
'Cause you love in
Yeah, you love in, streams
But I can't keep swimming uphill, woah

[Verse 2]
Wonder how we'll call it in the light
Saharan heat had me driving in the sky
Throwing stones 'cause you're getting bored
Kids in glass houses don't wear a lot of clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, so why you gotta drag me?
I've been in a hole since like last week
And I'm holding up, I've held on
I'm holding on

[Chorus]
'Cause you love in
And you love in, streams, streams
'Cause you love in, you love in, streams
But I can't keep swimming uphill
'Cause you love in, you love in, streams
Oh, the only way is up from here

[Verse 3]
Heart beats drowned out
Let me go now (to the haters?)
Blunt feel trauma (-to the youth)
Sleepless cycle (to the youth!)
Precess further

[Outro]
Do something, anything
Do whatever, you know?
Start a milk factory, go make uh, magazine, uh, get a job
Draw a painting, do anything, you know?
Have fun, stay safe
Safe sex, safe drugs
And, uh, have fun, that's it

[Intro]
Fucking hell, man
(Okay, ready now?)
(Yes)

[Verse 1]
I couldn't wait to leave that town
It broke my heart
I had to go (Shit)
I made a choice
To see this out I lost it all
You didn't show

[Pre-Chorus]
All you wanted was some violent form of love
Immolate me (Oh Lord)
All I was looking for was colours blurred
And words that I'd forget
And now I'm singing

[Chorus]
"Slow down
Keep those feet on the ground
I hope you'll be home soon"
Somehow we'll figure out how to cope
This is nothing we can't
There is nothing we can't do, right

[Verse 2]
You lost your voice, you couldn't sing
You couldn't talk about it
I stood and watched
The summer shone, rain down our backs
We didn't care
It was enough

[Pre-Chorus]
All you wanted was some violent form of love (Love!)
Immolate me, woah (Violence, violent)
All I was looking for was colours blurred
And nights that I'd forget
And now I'm singing

[Chorus]
"Slow down
Keep your feet on the ground
I hope I'll be home soon"
Somehow we figured out how to cope
This is nothing we can't
There is nothing we can't do
Right?

[Outro: Children singing an interpolation of Linstead Market]
Oh Lord
What a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
Lord what a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
Everybody come feel up, feel up
What their muma no bring
Everybody come feel up, feel up
What their muma no bring

Oh Lord
What a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
Lord what a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
(Aww)

[Verse 1]
Vacuum stuck to my head
Sucking out my
Vital thoughts
Where did I go wrong?
I know better
Than to wander
Far out of my mind
I'm out of my own mind
Again

[Verse 2]
Stomping out the
Ashes burning
Color in the flame
Destroying my escape
Slowly turning
Asking questions
When did we go wrong?
Why am I alone
Again?

[Refrain]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 3]
When the light hits your face
And you can't catch a break
And your love is your fate
You might not make it
If you wait for the day
The wrong day just might take you
Away to a place where you're too afraid
Don't let the scaries
Corrupt your story
I know it's crazy
It's almost amazing

[Refrain]
Ooh ooh

[Verse 4]
Catch my breath as
I lose focus
Leave the rest behind
There's nothing left to hide
New perspective
Got me thinking
I will be alright
Everyone loses
Their mind

[Refrain]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Intro: Brede Baldwin & EDEN]
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)

[Verse 1: Brede Baldwin]
Call to the world
Whispering through the valleys
That run through our blood and bones
Breaking the constant cycle

[Chorus: Brede Baldwin]
Deciding to live, free at last
Fight through the past, now it's finally time
We have the choice
You have the voice that will live through our sons
And move generations to come

[Bridge: Brede Baldwin]
So just try
Just hold tight
We found light
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Deciding to live
(We)
(To fight)

[Verse 2: EDEN]
Run from all you know
The concrete makes way to valleys
And all of our lessons learned
Will carry us through the unknown

[Chorus: EDEN]
Deciding to live, free at last
Fight through the past, now it's finally time
We have the choice
You have the voice that will live through our sons
And move generations to come

To come
To come
To come

[Outro: Brede Baldwin & EDEN]
So just try
Just hold tight
We found light
It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
Alright


Alright, let's start with the word "start," alright?
One, two, three
"Start!"
That's pretty sick though, alright
Alright, next one, next one
Okay, this-
Now is the word "end" alright?
So one, two, three
"End!"
Sick, alright, what else we got?
Okay, "love"
One, two, three
"Love!"
"Not," one, two, three
"Not!"
No, not that
Two more words to go guys, alright?
Next word is "wrong," so one, two, three
"Wrong!"
Hell yeah
And last one is "brave"
So, one, two, three
"Brave!"
Thank you so much guys
Who knows? Hopefully that worked and you'll end up on a song


[Verse 1]
'Cause we've been driving so long
I can't remember how we got here
Or how we survived so long
Trying to run from our pride
'Till you set fire to my atmosphere
And I remember how I spent the twenty-third
Feeling six feet under
When I'm thirty-thousand feet in the air
Chasing that sundown
So far east I'm westbound
Feeling like the edge of this world is near

[Pre-Chorus]
But you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to god I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back someday
This is more than just a phase, love
Shooting stars all break up
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things will be better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say

[Chorus]
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them
And they mean nothing to me?
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million, anyway?

[Verse 2]
'Cause you see only what you want to
Your tunnel vision owns you
And you can't see what's wrong
When you keep sleeping through the PM
Eyes wide open when you're dreaming
You're sleepwalking, just keep talking
Maybe you can talk your way out of this deep end
No B-plan in your system
Just tell me what you're thinking
I'm scared that you might fall
But you're not
But you're not

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Taking off your makeup
Sun always seems to wash our fears away
And it's always shining somewhere
I just gotta get there
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things are better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say

[Chorus]
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them
And they mean nothing to me?
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million?

[Bridge]
You're so much better than that
You're so much better than that
You're so much better than that
Stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million anyway?

[Outro]
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to God, I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say:
"You're so much better than that"




Are you bringing me in?
Are you taking me out?
Are you bringing me in?
Are you taking me out?

The scales will fall from my eyes
Reload me with one surprise
Destroy my dirt and burn me clean
Save me
Save me be my sweet gasoline

Reload me with one surprise
The scales will fall from eyes
With your blunted knives
Numbed out bliss never lies

Hunger soon tames your tongue
You'll thank me when I'm done
When I am done
The scales will fall from my eyes
You'll thank me when I am done

Are you taking me out?

When I am done
The scales will fall from my eyes
Are you bringing me in?
Are you taking me out?
Are you bringing me in?
Are you taking me out?

You'll thank me when I am done
When I am done
You'll thank me

I'm tryin' not to doubt, oh
I'm just tired of being down
Try and knock you down, oh
Just tryin' not to-
Yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse]
I'm tryin' not to doubt, oh
I'm just tired of being down
Try and knock you down, oh
Just tryin' not to-
Yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse]
I'm tryin' not to doubt, oh
I'm just tired of being down
Try and knock you down, oh
Just tryin' not to-
Yeah

[Chorus & Saxophone Solo]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Last night was a car crash
Highlights meet a quick end
Live the high life 'fore the weekends
Coming down hard to the sunset sinking in
Didn't try hard for a diehard
Nothing I can say that you won't get wrong
And everybody asks where you're gone now
Can you only really want what you don't have enough?
Everything you ever wanted adding up
To be the reason you can't stand it now
You talk a lot, well act like it
Finally found a way to get myself untangled
And undone, but it's alright
This ain't been the dream in a long time
Make sure you play the music when my time's up
Oh, just say it, I'm done

[Chorus]
So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?
'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most
But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world
Some say these things are for the best
How are you so sure?

[Verse 2]
And you can find me where the sea pours into the stars
I'll get there someday
I hope you find everything you think that you want
Bruises will fade
Time on our side, we can wait for it
I'll be doing fine, if you are
'Cause life is but a dream
Only as real as you let it be

[Chorus]
So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?
'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most
But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world
Some say these things are for the best
For better or worse

[Verse 1: EDEN]
Life goes on
The world turns without me
(Without me)

[Verse 2: Telepathics]
Life goes on
The light ends the dark
Mistakes made forgot
Through years and gods
Forever we are
Infinite


[Verse 1]
I used to wonder how it'd feel like
I looked to everyone for answers
Chasing round and down in circles, on purpose
In search of something
I spent a while trying to learn somehow
Some missing pieces will not stop me
I tried to fill my gaps with heartbeats, so fleeting, but cold feet
I'm sorry

[Chorus]
And I still don't know how I feel about it
And I still don't know but I feel like I'm learning
How to clear my head when all I think about is you
But I'm only human
I found out, I know now

[Verse 2]
I still wonder how I'd have turned out
If I'd done everything I wanted
If I'd lived like I feel like I could've, or should've
When I was younger
But I'm good now, I found out

[Chorus]
That I still don't know how I feel about it
And I still don't know but I feel like I'm learning
How to catch my breath when all I'm breathing for is you


[Verse 3]
I can't keep holding it down
But you keep showing me how
If you're only human
Oh, I think I found out, woah
I think I know now

[Outro]
I used to wonder what love is
But ever since you've been around
I finally think I have it figured out
What I missed then, but see now
I found out, I know now

[Verse]
But I could be more
Isn't there more?
Don't you dream of forgetting this?
Have we forgotten what we want?
Counting the wars and broken bones
Haven't we lost enough already?
Isn't this more than what it's worth?
Have we forgotten where we came from?
Long way from laying in the dirt
And if I can only dream of up from down there
God, help me, I'll be gone
Have I lost sight of everything I've worked for?
Did I get this all wrong?


[Intro]
1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she's in love with the concept
As if we're all just how she imagined
'Cause we're in love, I just don't know it yet, huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I don't believe in it no more
But I won't tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It's easier if she thinks she won
So I'ma let her, and she said

[Chorus 1]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
Girl, I don't think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No I don't love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks
But just know
I'm not singing for your XO
I'm just singing 'cause it's over
Yeah, uh, yeah


[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Came and went like the summer time
Was that a sunset or sunrise?
Looking back like, "Where'd the time go?"
So much for trying to keep this moving slow

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I don't believe in her no more
But I remember
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
I still remember what she said

[Chorus 2]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
But I don't think she knew me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I'm no liar, and I never hid anything
You should've seen it coming to this
Just know
I'm not singing for an ex, though
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah, yeah

[Drop]


[Outro]
Uh, girl I'm just singing
I'm just singing, yeah
I'm just singing 'cause it's over

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she's in love with the concept
As if we're all just how she imagined
'Cause we're in love but just don't know it yet, huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?
'Cause I don't believe in it no more
But I won't tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It's easier if she thinks she won
So I'ma let her, and she said

[Chorus]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
Girl I don't think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No I don't love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks
But just know
I'm not singing for your XO
I'm just singing 'cause it's over

[Verse 2]
Came and went like the summertime
Was that a sunset or a sunrise?
Looking back like where'd the time go?
So much for trying to keep this moving slow
'Cause I don't believe in her no more
But I remember


[Bridge]
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
And I still remember what she said

[Chorus]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
But I don't think she knew me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I'm no liar, and I never hid
Anything, you should have seen it coming to this
Just know
I'm not singing for an ex though
I'm just singing 'cause it's over
Girl I'm just singing
Just singing yeah
I'm just singing 'cause it's over

[Verse 3]
'Cause I've been trying to find another way
And I've been trying to get my story straight
Oh I've been saying if I ever change
Then it's going slow cause I've got me and all these ghosts I won't let go of
Oh yeah, you got way too many questions
'Bout the way of my decision
Got us stuck in this position
'Bout to break me down
And she can't hate me like I hate myself
And my skills
I'm lying for the thrill
I might just be destined, can't love
But that's just how I feel
I need to see your world to know it's real
Yeah
Oh and that's just how I feel
I feel
That's just how I feel
Oh yeah
And she said no I don't think I love you no more
That's just how I feel



[Intro: ATO]
I told her welcome to my place
Where the niggas roll and the girls won't stay away
Yeah

[Verse 1: ATO]
I told her welcome to my place (oh yeah)
Where the niggas roll and the girls won't stay away (okay)
And in London, yeah, on the west side that's where I stay
God chose me and I ain't even finished with it
God chose me I hope that they all with us
Oh yeah
Maybe we can show them somethin'
Show them somethin' out of nothin', bro
'Cause when I'm on my own
I know you on your own
You thinkin' 'bout your death
You thinkin' 'bout your stone
And you rappin' for your mum
You know we share some mums 'cause that's family
OMWMB
That shit gave me gravity for real
Fuck signing on a deal
If they ain't taking all of us, they can't take in none of us
On some James Brown again
Looking up and looking down
For those niggas in the sky and those niggas on the ground
I stay real for them forever 'til whenever the forever is
And I pray they never forget why the fuck I'm doin' this
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: ATO]
'Cause I been rolling with the conquerors tonight
That's my team, we up and comin' girl tonight
And if they didn't know, they know it now
Listen girl, 'cause you'll be missing out

[Chorus: ATO]
You know
I'm not tryna' be different like you know
I'm just puttin' it down, lettin' you know
I've got a few ex-bitches that you know
If I want you in, I'll let you know
I've got more goals than you know
Got more goals than Ronaldo
And let it sit in some of that cologne, yeah

For sale
My team that ain't for sale
My girl that ain't for sale
My soul that ain't for sale
Won't sell out, nah
For sale
My flow that ain't for sale
My business ain't for sale
My future ain't for sale
Won't do it ever

[Verse 2: ATO]
Look, we both have a history but that might affect our future
So at present keep that as a mystery, 'cause I don't plan to do what I used to
Dark nights in a dark room with nobody
Just me
Me myself and I in conflict
But to you it just looks like me huh
But that's normal right
Kickin' and screamin' through the night
Party 'til tomorrow is born in an English storm and today so quietly die as I feel like
They ain't got nothing on me
They ain't got nothing like this, nah
Feel like I'm running the team
Got Rag- on Rag- on Ragstar
If they ain't feeling will they know my name
If they ain't feeling then I'll feel the same
I'm real as ever, I'll never change
Disturb the water and watch the waves
Last year was feeling like it's never gonna pop
Spending time by the sea throwing rocks but I never wrap it up
That's not me
If there was a news car, probably be writing to the bounce of my heartbeat
This young fucker's got what money can't buy
Real girls love makes a rich man see
That the grass might be a little greener on the other side
So tell me what you know what you know
Tell me where you been where you been on the low
Uh, tell 'em
We're the conquerors, you know this

[Pre-Chorus: ATO]
'Cause I been rollin' with the conquerors tonight
That's my team, we up and comin' girl tonight
And if they didn't know, they know it now
Listen girl, 'cause you'll be missin' out

[Chorus: ATO]
You know
I'm not tryna' be different like you know
I'm just putting it down, letting you know
I've got a few ex-bitches that you know
If I want you in, I'll let you know
I've got more goals than you know
Got more goals than Ronaldo
And let it sit in some of that cologne, yeah

For sale
My team that ain't for sale
My girl that ain't for sale
My soul that ain't for sale
Won't sell out, nah
For sale
My flow that ain't for sale
My business ain't for sale
My future ain't for sale
Won't do whatever

[Bridge: EDEN]
She told me, "Baby, it was just one
It was just one night"
She told me, "Baby, it was just one
It was only one night"
She told me, "Baby, it was just one
It was just one"
She told me, "Baby, it was just one"
And I said, "You were just another"

[Chorus: ATO]
You know
I'm not tryna' be different like you know
I'm just puttin' it down, lettin' you know
I've got a few ex-bitches that you know
If I want you in, I'll let you know
I've got more goals than you know
Got more goals than Ronaldo
And let it sit in some of that cologne, yeah

For sale
My team that ain't for sale
My girl that ain't for sale
My soul that ain't for sale
Won't sell out nah
For sale
My flow that ain't for sale
My business that ain't for sale
My future that ain't for sale
Won't do whatever

That's kinda fucked up


[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yea, I- I like it when you just, listen more, like, I just wanna, let go)
Today I'm listening to Macy Gray
And Billie Holiday
Miles Davis and John Coltrane
Tryna reminisce on the days I would take a train to my father's place
A few panic attacks away
Life is a circle and I used to run it
Been round it enough, to light it then smoke it up
Got me coughing 'cause I don't do this shit a lot
These clothes are old but my trainers the latest drop
Schmitt, Lenin on my bedside and Malcolm X
Ewan just sent me The Alchemist, that's next
My girl's here quite often these days
That's a new picture for a frame, while the frame gets bigger then smaller
That's my little brother in the corner
He don't look like me but he's like me
Says a lot about the world if you ask me
I'd give him the world if he asked me
In this black and white work, he doesn't read into colours
In his colouring book they all complement each other
I learn more from him than from anyone else
Not to question the world but let it question me
We should all try and listen to the simplest minds
For more times they see more than we do
Blinded by the lies that are designed to deceive you
I want to meditate and reason with evil
Heard you're forcing a reason for why we're not talking
But that's not the truth
Some things are better let go and better unsaid
I'll shake your hand and wish you the best
I'm waking up to a sunset
And fall asleep to a drunk text
"I'm proud of you" is what my Mum said
"I love you" is what my Dad said
Yo, those are the words I need
They feel like a breeze
They let your Son breathe


[Chorus]
Yeah
Feel the gas from the stove
Hear the cars fill the roads
Finally alone
Step out of your clone
Throw it in the washing machine and watch it go
It'll be dry by tomorrow my bro
An old space
My suitcase in the middle
These four walls tell you how well they listen
Window that talked to me and taught me things
It ain't much but it's everything

[Verse 2]
There's an art to honesty
Let truth slide off either side before it gets on top of me
Truth is, all of this shit's beyond my control
Until I start giving it thought and let it go
Men have tried to pierce this question we're in
Only sadness has shown 'em where a next world begins
So I stop asking questions and let life ask 'em
Fall back as these walls begin to darken
Good morning
It's beautiful this morning
Sun shines through the window I left open
Travels up these walls that got to know me
I'll answer all the questions that you show me
I leant on you
'Til you were bruised too
That's why I shoulda never let those other walls go
Leant on you
'Til you shrugged me off
It's why I shoulda never let those other walls go
I grew up so well with my Mother
I woulda never had it any other
I'm still laid here reminiscing
Me holding your forced hand that forced all the difference
I miss your cooking
I miss just chillin'
Talk feelings
In our house we had no ceilings
Just gimme the time and the place
And we'll recreate it
Today we got to talking 'bout philosophy
And the human passion for action
The desire to take one step forwards
Despite inevitably taking two steps backwards
We're too deep, to know which way the waves go
As your words ring around my head like a halo
Pull up to the station
Asking when you'll see me again
And I said "You'll always be my best friend"


[Chorus]
Feel the gas from the stove
Hear the cars fill the roads
Finally alone
Step out of your clone
Throw it in the washing machine and let it go
It'll be dry in an hour or so
A new space
My suitcase in the middle
These four walls, wonder how well they'll listen
Window that'll talk to me and teach me things
It ain't much but it's everything
Amen
