[Paul McCartney]
One, two, three, four!

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, "Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward."
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one, hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"
'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
"Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are."
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
"Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?"
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!"
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one, hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one, hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail 'cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one, hit me

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one, hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one, hit me
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one, hit me

[Outro]
You crazy for this one, Rick
It's your boy




Only "Pet Sounds" tops this. See you in 2200 and  this will still be relevant


[Verse 1]
My little brother's in the other room, that's why my house a mess
I'm a victim to these afterthoughts, yes I'm sure you could guess why
Yes I'm sure you could guess why, why

The sink is full of dishes, Pizza Pockets in a pan
But I guess if you get hungry I can heat them up again if you like

If you like, how's your night? Watch your step over that box it's my bad
My little brother is a handful oh man, oh man

Or do you like to play funny games I got Scrabble or Candyland
I'm a handyman, my candy band, spinning Beatles
I'm a Abbey fan on the needles I'm spinning records for you
I'm spinning records for two

[Chorus]
She came in through the bathroom window, disturbed my golden slumbers
Had to carry that weight 'til the end
Her majesty come together (right now)
Hit like Maxwell's silver hammer, it's something
I'm a mean Mister Mustard

[Verse 2]
Made it through the gumdrop mountain, octopus' garden playing Oh, Darling
Here comes the sun that rainbow pass is only saying the end
Sun king to king candy let's pretend, let's pretend


My little brother's in the other room, that's why my house a mess
I'm a victim to these afterthoughts, yes I'm sure you could guess why

[Chorus]
She came in through the bathroom window, disturbed my golden slumbers
Had to carry that weight 'til the end
Her majesty come together (right now)
Hit like Maxwell's silver hammer, it's something

[Outro]
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

This is the introduction to Ringo's "Don't Pass Me By"
Take 4

[Orchestra]

[Verse 1: Ringo]
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Verse 2: Ringo]
I hear the clock a'ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3: Ringo]
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry


[Verse 1: Ringo]
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door

Does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Outro: Ringo]
I'm waiting for you, honey
Hurry up to me
I don't want you to pass me by
I don't want you to make me cry
I want you to make me happy
Happy, happy
'Cause that's what I want
This is so friendly
This is so friendly
This is so friendly

They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

[Bridge]
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today-oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
*alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream


[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today-oh, boy
Four-thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on

It's scary to think this has became regular
A crowd of people stood and stared
They hadn't seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
They were all standing by the House of lords

I saw a article today, oh boy
The English army had just a made war
A number of people couldn't believe it
But It was easy for me
And maybe you'll agree

And every day, it sure lets out
I see my baby, I get weak in the knees
'Cause nothin's shakin' but the leaves on the tree
My papi told me there'd be times like these
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
We meet the gang and go to rockin' Joe's
The cats are something on the heels and toes
I grab my baby, tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be such a dog-gone tease?
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

[Pre-Chorus: George Harrison]
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please

[Chorus: George Harrison]
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah

[Rodney Burke] Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it. What is it?
[John] It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead
[Rodney] Oh!
[John] It says, "Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all
A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at school"
Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling "Clarabella"

[Verse 1]
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning
But it's not always going to be this grey

[Chorus]
All things must pass
All things must pass away

[Verse 2]
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving
It has not always been this grey

[Chorus]

All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So I must be on my way
And face another day

[Verse 3]
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this grey

When I was sitting on my piano one day
A magical thought came my way
To write a number for the BBC
Kenny Everett McCartney
All together on the wireless machine
Kenny Everett McCartney
All together on the wireless machine
Kenny Everett McCartney
All together on the wireless machine



[Intro: Pharrell (Jay-Z)]
(Young! It's the life)
(Once again it's the life, yes)
I don't know why, I.. get so high oh
(It's intoxicating man, y'all don't know why you do what you do)
Get so high oh, get so high, high off the life

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My women-friends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
My brother hustled so, naturally
Up next was me, but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starring role in "Hovito's Way"

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)
But every time I felt "That was that", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (OH NO!)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toupee,mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a souffle
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say "hooray" to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the Name of Love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)
But every time I felt "That was that", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (OH NO!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I never felt more alive than riding shotgun
In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need -
What the game did to my pulse - with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why I just love to get high
Drink, "life!" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dying young, leaving a good-lookin corpse, of course

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)
But every time I felt "That was that", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (OH NO!)

You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing

You don't get me

You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me

When your prized possessions
Start to wear you down
Look in my direction
I'll be round, I'll be round

When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be round, I'll be round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me

When your prized possessions
Start to wear you down
Look in my direction
I'll be round, I'll be round


You tell me that you've got everything you want

Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

In the night, there are sights to be seen
Stars like jewels on the crown of a Queen
But the only sight I wanna view
Is that wonderful picture of you

On a Streetcar, or in the cafe
All of the evening, and most of the day
My mind is in a maze what can I do?
I still see that picture of you

It was last summer, I fell in love
My heart told me what to do
I saw you there on the crest of a hill
An' I took a little picture of you

Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you went my heart, my love and my life
I didn't know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you

Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you, went my heart, my love and my life
I didn't know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you
I'm left with a picture of, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you

[Verse]
Well, if your hands start a-clapping
And your fingers start a-popping
And your feet start a-moving around

And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound

And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round

[Chorus 1]
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure

Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?

Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing
And chills coming up on you

[Intro]

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself

Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets (oh) is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Ooh!

[Bridge]

Ooh!

Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, in mama's head it's got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself


[Outro]

We all miss you; You miss them?
Yeah!
The Beatles miss you; all the Beatles missed you
Now, junior, behave yourself



If you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you

The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I lost my one and only
They'd be sad if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighing
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me

But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me

So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cos they know I got my one and only
They'll be glad you're not bad to me

They'll be glad you're not bad to me, to me, to me


This is the fourth by the four. 'Please, Please Me', 'With The Beatles', 'Hard Day's Night'. That's three. Now...'Beatles For Sale'.

The young men themselves aren't for sale. Money, noisy though it is, doesn't talk that loud. But you can buy this album - you probably have, unless you're just browsing, in which case don't leave any dirty fingerprints on the sleeve!

It isn't all currency or current though. There's priceless history between the covers. None of us is getting any younger. When, in a generation or so, a radio-active, cigar-smoking child, picnicking on Saturn, asks you what The Beatles affair was all about - ;Did you actually know them?'- don't try to explain all about the long hair and the screams! Just play the child a few tracks from this album and he'll probably understand what it is all about. The kids of AD 2000 will draw from this music much the sam sense of well being and warmth we do today.

For the magic of The Beatles is, I suspect, timeless and ageless. It has broken all frontiers and barriers. It has cut through differences of race, age, and class. It is adored by the world.

This album has some lovely samples of Beatles music. It has, for instance, eight new titles wrought by the incomparable John Lennon and Paul Mccartney, and mingling with the new, there are six numbers culled from the rhythmic wealth of the past extraordinary decade; pieces like Kansas City, and Rock and Roll Music. Marvelous.

Many hours and hard day's nights of devoted industry went into the production of this album. It isn't a potboiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-christmas mixture.

At least three of the Lennon-Mccartney songs were seriously considered as single releases until John popped up with I Feel Fine. These three were Eight Days A Week, No Reply and I'm A Loser. Each would have topped the charts, but as it is they are an adornment to this LP, and a lesson to other artists. As on other albums, The Beatles have tossed in far more value than the market usually demands.

There are few gimmicks or recording tricks, though for effect, The Beatles and their recording manager George Martin have slipped in some novelties. Like Paul on Hammond organ to introduce drama into Mr. Moonlight, which also, and for the first time, has George Harrison applying a thump to an elderly African drum because Ringo was busy elsewhere in the studio, playing bongos. George's thump remains on the track. The bongos were later dropped. Ringo plays timpani in Every Little Thing, and on the Rock and Roll Music track George Martin joins John and Paul on one piano. On Words of Love, Ringo plays a packing case.

Beyond this, it is a straightforward 1964 disc-making. Quite the best of it's kind in the world. There is little or nothing on the album that cannot be reproduced on stage, which is, as students and critics of pop-music know, not always the case.

Here it is then. The best album yet-quite definitely, says John, Paul, George, and Ringo-full of everything which made the four the biggest attraction the world has ever known. Full of raw John and Melodic Paul; a number from George, and a bonus from Ringo. For those who like to know who does exactly what, there are details alongside each title.



[Speech]

[Ringo] I'm Ringo and I play the drums
[Paul] I'm Paul and I play the ehm bass [Chhhh]
[George] I'm George and I play a guitar [whistle]
[John] I'm John and I too play guitar, sometimes I play the fool


Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour!
Step right this way!

Roll up
Roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up
Roll up for the mystery tour

The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away, take you today

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Everywhere people stare
Each and ev'ry day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say


Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!

Oho, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me to, ohohoho, oho
And when I ask you to be mine, ahaha
You're gonna say you love me too

It's been a hard days night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

Oh!

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah!
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away


She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
And she don't care

Jo-Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo-Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back!
Get back!



Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me
Starlight and dewdrops are awaiting thee
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day
Led by the moonlight have all passed away

Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song
List while I woo the with soft melody
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng

Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me!

Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelei
Over the streamlet vapors are borne
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn

Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart

Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

[Verse 1]
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride
Well you take your car along
And you park it outside
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am
Well every time you're going to drive
You find the joint is jammed

[Verse 2]
Well if you want to hear some music
Like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot
Don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overcome you
Because they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd
Well you can dance
I know you will, you thought
I got my eyes on you baby
Because you dance so good

Don't let him
Steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes you all night and day

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight

Gotta keep a peace like a Buddhist

Oh, never I write, but if, ever I write

[Brian Matthew] The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--
[Paul] Yes?
[John] Hey! Listen!
[Paul] It's all changed, now, Brian They're not doing that, no actors
[John] It's all changed, now
[Brian] But this is what I wonder In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor, did you find that?
[John] No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film You should have seen the rest

[Brian] He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin Do you think that's right?
[John] He was miming
[Paul] You, too, with Jason
[John] Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?
[Brian] Beginning to look like that Now, then--
[Ringo] All right, John. Can you hear me?


[Verse 4]
[Paul] Can you hear him? Hello!
[Brian] Not really I hope not I hope not!
[John] We brought you the flowers, Ring
[Brian] He's not allowed to talk
[Ringo] Eh?
[John] We brought you the flowers

[Verse 5]
[Ringo] Oh, good
[John] And the grapes
[Ringo] Oh, I like grapes
[Paul] He likes grapes
[George] We've been to Portugal
[Brian] Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then


[Verse 6]
[All] Who?
[Brian] Los Beatles
[John] Los Beatles? Great, great laugh
[Brian] I don't suppose you know the title of your film in Portuguese?
[John] No Crinsk dee Night?
[Brian] Could be, let's hear the number, shall we?
[John] Right

[Unintelligible] in the middle of her meditation course in Rishikesh, India. No one was to know that, s-s-sooner or later, she was to go completely berserk under the care of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. All the people around were very worried about the girl, because she was going insane, so we sang to her
Thank you

[Brian Matthew] But despite the fact that the next request comes from Anton, 32
Perry Road, Sherwood, in Nottingham, it's headed "Up the Pool" and starts
"Dear Wack!" So, John, you take it from there
[John] "Dear Wack! Please, ask those gorgeous lads," ha, ha," called the Beatles
To sing 'You Really Got a Hold on Me' for Di, Gus, Wizz, and me, also for the
Beatles, themselves, especially Paul," ha, "and everybody that was in the Roy
Orbison Tour. I'm a regular listener of 'Pop Go the Beatles,'" good lad, "and
Please, tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show
Thank you"
[Brian] All right, stop the band. Oh, that's splendid and now, what are you
Going to sing for us?
[John] "You Really Got a Hold on Me...Mother"

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
They say "They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone."
So on that note, I'm leavin' after the song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
Now I'm just scratchin' the surface
'Cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted, hold on

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seein' me
So, with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me movin' this crack
"Gimme a second, I swear," I would say about my rap career
Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here, goodbye

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst 'til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this was the stress I lived with
'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
'Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody's fault, I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me

[Outro: Jay-Z]
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade...

Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 1]
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, 'cause I'm straight with the Roc

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 2]
Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 3]
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Outro]
You're now tuned into the mu'fuckin' greatest
Best rapper alive, best rapper alive

[Verse 1]
Since she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same, but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away, leave me alone
Don't bother me

[Verse 2]
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right, when every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

[Bridge]
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

[Verse 3]
But till she's here
Please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone

You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are

[Verse 2]
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tomboy
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to be
As sweet as you are

[Bridge]
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So, how can I get tired of you?

Now, lots of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to be
As sweet as you are

Please, don't ever change
Don't you ever change

You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?

*Sighs* Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore

[Interlude]
Owww, it's star time
This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to the stage
Say "Hova!" - c'mon, say it!
Are y'all out there? [crowd chants "HO-VA! HO-VA!"]

Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about
They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!

INTERVIEWER: Do you think the bug has bitten now? Are you guys - do you have big eyes now to be actors?

PAUL: No.

GEORGE: Not really, no. We still, you know, even if our film - this, A Hard Day's Night - is the biggest box office attraction ever, you know, it still won't make us feel as though we're actors. But I think we'd all enjoy making a new film.

RINGO: Yeah, it's good fun. I think the next one we make will be more fun, because we've sort of got the hang of things. Like on this one, when we first started, when we're not supposed to look at the camera, you'd always sort of find yourself turning 'round and smiling at it. [laughs] You'd just smile as soon as you saw the camera, you know.

PAUL: And on this one, I don't know whether this happens on lots of films, we used to keep breaking up giggling.

RINGO: Yeah.

PAUL: We had some great giggling fits, you know. We'd sort of say a line, and I kept doing it a particular way. There was one line I kept saying to Ringo, it's about the grandfather in the film who goes off to-

RINGO: Well, we can't tell you, 'cause we'll ruin the film, you see!

PAUL: We can't tell you [inaudible] but it was just this one thing where the grandfather goes off to a club, and I was supposed to say to Ringo "It's all your fault" and things. 'Cause in the film actually, although it's not true in real life, we sort of pick on Ringo a bit, you know, because it was obvious really, because he's sort of smaller and it looks funny in the film. But I'm supposed to be picking on Ringo and saying "It's all your fault" and things. And as I was saying it, I'm a bit - I kept flapping my arms up and down, I don't know why, I must have thought I was a good actor! [laughter] And I was just sort of flapping around and saying, "It's all your fault!" [sound of arms flapping; laughs] Flapping my arms around, and he couldn't stand it, he was giggling away. So then I started laughing, and we just collapsed, and we took so many takes on that bit.

RINGO: Yeah, twelve takes on that bit.

PAUL: Yeah. And I think we cut that bit in the end or something. [laughs]

RINGO: Yeah.

PAUL: They cut some of it.


RINGO: They cut half of it, yeah, but you know, a lot of laughs. All different things that happened were funny to us which, you know, they haven't printed or put on the film, but it's great when we go and see the film, then we can sort of say, "Remember that bit?" if they showed the one we did before, you know, where we all broke up.

Her heart can lie tonight

Those California dreaming nights
I never thought we'd be this high
We're dancing side by side
Now we drunk in love tonight
Staring at the sky
The stars a passing by
Don't you let me try
If it's just this one time

It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right
It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right

[Verse 1]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 2]
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Bridge]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 3]
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door

[Verse 4]
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah

[Outro]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go


[Chorus]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 1]
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 2]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 3]
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 4]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong


[Verse 5]

And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh, ah

[Chorus]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right

I'm fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
And that's right

[Bridge 1]
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong

I'm right where I belong
Silly people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 3]
I'm painting a room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh ooh ooh aah aah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey

And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Silly people runnin' round
They worry me and never ask me why they don't get past my door

[Verse 4]
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh ooh ooh aah aah

[Outro]
Fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go, oh
Where it will go, oh
Fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go, oh

Merry Christmas

Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him


[Verse 1]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

[Verse 2]
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

[Bridge]
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 3]
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[French Horn Solo]

[Bridge]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years


[Verse 4]
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him

[Verse 5]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

[Bridge]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I'm livin' the blues

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true

And you've really got a hold me

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

[Bridge: George Harrison]
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free

Ah
Ah
Ah

[Verse 2]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Oooooo

Late yesterday night
I saw a light shine from a window
And as I looked again
Your face came into sight

I couldn't walk on
Until you'd gone from your window
I had to make you mine
I knew you were the one

Oh, I would be glad
Just to have a love like that
Oh, I would be true
And I'd live my life for you

So meet me tonight
Just where the light shines from our window
And as I take your hand
Say that you'll be mine tonight

Oh, I would be so glad
Just to have a love like that
Oh, I would be true
And I'd give my life for you

So meet me tonight
Just where the light shines from our window
And as I take your hand
Say that you'll be mine tonight

[Intro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison]
It's getting better all the time

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (Ah-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool, you fool)

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Fool, you fool)

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Bridge: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]

When friends are there, you feel a fool (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)

When you say she's looking good (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)

Will she still believe it when he's dead?

[Verse 2]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Verse 4]
People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet The Wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear

But it just don't work on me




[Verse 1]
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

[Verse 2]
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

[Refrain]
Got to get you into my life

[Verse 3]
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

[Refrain]
Got to get you into my life

[Short interlude]

[Chorus]
I've got to get you into my life

[Outro]
I was alone, I took a ride

I was alone, I took a ride

Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)

Ooh, you were meant to be near me (Ah-ahh)
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

[Refrain]
Got to get you into my life
Somehow, some way

[Verse 3]
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
Ooh, then I suddenly see you (Mhmm-mm)
Ooh, did I tell you I need you (Mhmm)
Every single day of my life


[Refrain]
Got to get you into my life
Somehow, some way

[Short interlude]
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love

[Chorus]
Into my life
Uh-somehow, some way

[Outro]
Got to get you into my life
Oh-oh-oh
Uh-hear me, ooh
Doo-doo (Dee-dee-dee)
Doo-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Intro]
Yesterday was today
The 29th of May
18 years of age
Thought I'd never see that day
Hol' up.. Wait
Suddenly, it's all starting to hit me
Why we have to go? I don't know
I guess just a part of life
And we all gotta grow
Old, Woah

[Hook]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they are here to stay
Oh I believe, in yesterday!

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they are here to stay
Oh I believe, in yesterday!

[Verse 1]
Loki
Highschool ruled, thought I'd never leave
So many memories, thinkin back It's killin' me!
So softy. Mommy please stop me
From maturing, I am in no hurry
Why am I so worried?
My futures kinda blurry
My feelings kinda mixed up
Like a mcflurry!


No words can explain
Just how I feel
Oh so much pain
The feelings so unreal
Life is but a game
It's time to spin the wheel
Do you feel the same?
Or is this no big deal?

Shit keeps gettin real!
Loki how ya feel?
Bittersweet
140 characters couldn't fit it in a tweet
I love the class of 13
Retweet!
All you underclass men hit favorite
Cause we just graduated..

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Class of thirteen
Up on the big screen
Ragers we threw were like a project x scene
We're just a bunch of teens
Who fein for untamed dreams
Cause reality, isn't what it seems
Life is too short
So I never hold a grudge
Were all very different doesn't mean you gotta judge
When push come to shove
It's all peace and love
No fight club


Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now i need a place to hide away
Oh i believe in yesterday
Why she had to go i dont know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now i long for yesterday
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now im about to graduate
Hol' up...wait
Aye
Its the Graduation song

[Outro]
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Today is a gift
Thats why we call it the present



[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby, and I love her so
And every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so

[Verse 2]
When I call her on the telephone
She says, "Baby, I'm all alone"
Before the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door

[Verse 3]
Every evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
"Hey baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I just love that chick so

[Verse 1: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
(...down)
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

[Penny Lane]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane

[Intro]
To lead a better life I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Bridge]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Verse 3]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Bridge]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me

Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Outro]
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere




Here we go again
Here we go again and again
Wond'rin' how it all began
Wond'rin' will it ever end

Round and round we go
Where it's going, nobody knows
Though I know we've been this place before
Someone keeps on moving the door

Here we go agai-ai-ai-ain
Here we go agai-ain
Here we go agai-ai-ai-ain
Here we go agai-ain

So I say hello again
And nobody gives a damn
And nobody wants to hold your hand
Ev'ryone is an also-ran

Round and round we go
Where it's going, nobody knows
Though I know we've seen this place before
Someone keeps on moving the door

Here we go agai-ai-ai-ain
Here we go agai-ain
Here we go agai-ai-ai-ain
Here we go agai-ain

Round and round we go-oh-oh-oh
Round and round we go-oh

What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

[Chorus: John Lennon]
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

[Verse 3: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & Ringo Starr]
Big man (Yeah)
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue


[Chorus: John Lennon]
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na na na na na na na na na yeah

Build a house and craft a sword
The minute you head into the mine

You have iron, now go and smelt it
Remember to use some coal for fuel

That want to kill you
Take your sword and kill them all

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world

[Outro]
That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
She's in love with me and I feel fine
Mmm




[Intro: John Lennon]
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

[Bridge]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I fell in love with you




[Verse 1]
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

[Verse 2]
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

[Bridge]
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

[Verse 3]
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 4]
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

[Bridge]
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

[Verse 3]
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah




[Verse]
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time

[Chorus] [x2]
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Because I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget




If you leave me, baby
I don't know what I'll do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die
Oh, if you want me, baby
You've gotta come to me
Mm, I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Ooh, some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die
Well, if you want me, baby
Mm, you've gotta come to me
I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me
Well, if you want me, baby
Mm, you've gotta come to me
I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me
Well, if you leave me, baby
I don't know what I'll do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Mm, some god damned insurance on me, baby
If you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die




[Chorus 1]
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me (Oh oh)

[Chorus 2]
You're quite contend to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just because you're trouble
Then don't bring your troubles to me

[Verse]
I don't think it's funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamond and rings (Oh oh)

You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny
When you know what money can bring

[Chorus 3]
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two

Never runnin' in the streets
And leavin' me alone

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna search this town
From door to door
Love I crave
I can't find no more

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 2]
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 3]
Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 4]
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever do in my life
I wanna find that little woman
Make her my wife

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye




[Chorus 1]
Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand

[Verse]
Well you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand
But the way you deceive me
I just don't understand

[Chorus 2] [x2]
Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand

[Chorus 1]




[Verse 1]
You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

[Bridge 1]
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Verse 2]
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

[Bridge 2]
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Verse 3]
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

[Bridge 1]
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Outro]
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again


[Verse]
The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go

[Chorus]
They were right I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way hey

[Chorus]




[Verse 1]
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead

[Verse 2]
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead

[Bridge]
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-hey
But I'll come back again someday

[Verse 3]
And when I do you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

[Bridge]
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-hey
But I'll come back again someday

'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two

Until then I'll cry instead


[Verse 1]
One day, you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

[Verse 2]
Some day, you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

[Bridge]
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end, you will know
Oh-oh-oh

But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

[Intro]
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Verse 1]
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

[Chorus]
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Verse 2]
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

[Chorus]
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Harmonica and Guitar Solos]

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

[Chorus]
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser

[Intro]
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Verse 1]
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

[Verse 2]
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

[Bridge]
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Verse 3]
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

[Bridge]
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Verse 3]
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you


Every night I can't sleep thinking of you
And every little thing that you do
And I'm telling all my friends I'm in love
And I'm telling the world you make me feel proud
You make me want to shout out aloud
So I'm telling all my friends I'm in love

Oh, I'm feeling on the top of the world
I'm in love with a wonderful girl
I've never felt this way before
If this is love, give me more, more, more, more

...I'm telling you
...thing that you do

I'm telling all my friends I'm in love, in love
Yes, I'm telling all my friends I'm in love, in love
I'm telling all my friends I'm in love

[Verse 1]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Verse 2]
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 3]
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight


[Verse 4]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Outro]
Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Ah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You changed, you changed, you changed, you changed

[Verse 1]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Verse 2]
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 3]
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Outro]
Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Ah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You changed, you changed, you changed, you changed

[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

[Verse 2]
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse 3]
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling


[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

[Verse 1]
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

[Verse 3]
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I met her walking down a uptown street
She's so fine you know I wished she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet

I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Yeah, I do mean you
I'm just trying to get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I tell ya now she looks so good
Got so much skills and such a beautiful will
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood

I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Come on and give me a cue
So I can get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She's sitting right here by my side
Lovely indeed that why I asked if she
Promised someday she will be my bride

Talkin' 'bout you

Nobody but you
Come on, let me get a message through




Oh yeah, alright
Are you gonna be in my dreams, tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
And in the end the love you take
Is equal to the love you make


[Verse 1]
You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

[Verse 2]
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me

[Bridge]
Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore

[Verse 3]
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you

[Bridge]
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore


[Verse 3]
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
I need you

[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

[Bridge 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

[Bridge 2: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life, I love you more

So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, my heart went "boom" when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, Paul McCartney & John Lennon]

Oh, I remember you-ooh
I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue-ooh

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh

[Chorus]
I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue-ooh

And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh

I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue-ooh

[Verse 4]
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember
Tell them I remember
Tell them I remember you

[Verse 1]
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do

[Verse 2]
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more

[Intro]
It's all too much
It's all too much

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

[Chorus]
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

[Verse 2]
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

[Chorus]
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

[Verse 3]
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea


[Chorus]
It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

[Outro]
It's too much
Ah, it's too much

With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue

You're too much, ah

Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a

Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a


Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much

I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do
It's for you love, true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you
They said that love was a lie
Told me that I
Never should try to find
Somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you
And love comes love shows
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you

[Verse: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
It's okay to leave a dog in a hot car
It's okay to leave a dog in a hot car (hot car!)
Nothing bad could possibly happen
If you leave a dog in a hot car



[Verse: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car (Hot car)
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car (Ooh)
Nothing bad could possibly happen
If you leave a dog in a hot car

[Speech]
[Dick Cavett] John, do you mind telling me about the song: 'It's Okay to Leave Your Dog In A Hot Car?'
[John] Uh, I don't quite remember that one very well, but you know, it was the sixties! We didn't know any better
Oh, I think George actually wrote that one

[Paul] Uh, it was all John's idea, yeah
He knew exactly what he was talking about, y'know
He bloody hated dogs
When he wasn't ruthlessly stomping them on the streets
He would cook them up in a stew and eat them
I can't really say I blame him, though
Little bastards




[Paul and John]
It's okay to leave a dog in a hot car

[Verse - John]
I was thinking that I had it good
Beat my wife like I knew I should
Suddenly a spanner jams the cogs
She went and bought the family a dog


[Pre-Chorus - Paul]
I was supposed to take him to the vet
I'll lock him in the car and watch him sweat

[Chorus]
It's ok to leave your dog in a hot car
(As long as you don't look back)
It's ok to leave your dog in a hot car
As long as you leave the window closed
You'll always know
That nothing bad can possibly happen
The doors locked tight
And he's out of sight
So go and leave your dog in the car


[Verse - John]
Today's only 35 degrees
So leave the mutt in the limousine
Roll the windows up so he stays warm
A little sunlight never caused no harm


[Pre-Chorus - Paul]
Just make sure there isn't any doubt
The last thing that I need's him getting out

[Chorus]
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
(As long as you don't look back)
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
As long as you tell the passers by
He'll be alright
Then nothing bad can possibly happen
Now it's all over
For dear old rover
So go and leave your dog in the car



[Paul - Mr. Willy]
Mr. Willy and his big fat hands
Are gonna slap your mummy's glands
Until the cows come home
And all the girls and boys
Who don't like any noise
Are gonna send the word by phone
Everything's the same
But they don't know who to blame
When their life's a custard pie
And everybody in it's
Gotta get a sharper wit
To see the faces in the sky

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Outro Chorus]
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
It's Ringo who sang the ahs

It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
And Ringo I shagged your wife

It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
Keep Clapton away from mine

It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
[Ringo] I warn you with peace and love

[Yoko Ono] It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
[George] Please give me my biscuits back

It's okay to leave a car in a hot dog
[Ringo] But two of us don't eat meat
It's okay to leave a dog in YOUR FACE




[Verse 1]
I get high when I see you go by
My, oh, my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Verse 2]
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you


[Outro]
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

Here am I sitting all on my own

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah

Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

[Verse 2]
Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day I've done nothing but cry

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

Who knows how long I've loved you?
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will

[Verse 2]
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

[Bridge]
Love you forever, and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

[Verse 3]
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be to near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know, I will, I will

Da-da-da da-da
La-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da

You know that it's true (Rattle them skulls)




One, two, three

Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I won't

Yes, you will

Let me swim you down
'Cause I'm diving to Jellyfish Fields
Fishing is real
And nothing to get hooked about
Jellyfish Fields forever
Lead-weight fishing is easy with eyes closed
Stauromedusae is all you see
Fishing is hard (to be someone)
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to Pearl
Let me dive you down
'Cause I'm swimming to Jellyfish Fields
Fishing is real
And nothing to get harpooned about
Jellyfish Fields forever
No one I think is in my rock
I mean it must be sponge or pat
That is you can't, you know, let them go
But it's all right
That is, I think, pretty funny
Let me submerge you down
'Cause I'm diving to Jellyfish Fields
The fishing is real
And nothing to get caught about
Jellyfish Fields forever
Always, no, sometimes think it's Mr Krabs
But you know I reel when it's a catch
I think, good, grief, I mean, er, yes
But it's all in the reef
That is I think I am just hungry (for a Krabby Patty)
Let me dive you down
'Cause I'm swimming to Jellyfish Fields
The fishing is real
And nothing to get hauled about
Jellyfish Fields forever
Jellyfish Fields forever
Jellyfish Fields forever


Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

[Chorus:]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot

[Chorus:]
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away

[Chorus:]
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead


[Chorus:]

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play


[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

[Verse 3]
Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

[Verse 1]
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia

[Verse 2]
Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

[Verse 3]
Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Uhh, this feel right right here, Quik
It's like it's supposed to happen this one right here
Young! God damn
Let me justify my thug on this one right here

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
It goes one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, Roc
Five six seven o'clock, eight o'clock, Roc
Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, the party bout to pop
Then, Roc-A-Fella y'all, It's your boy S. Dot
And I ain't never been to jail; I ain't never pay a nigga
To do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell, even if it means sittin in a cell
I ain't never ran, never will
I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands
To himself or get clapped for what's under that man's belt
I never asked for nothin I don't demand of myself
Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself
I just play the hand I'm dealt, I can't say I've never knelt
Before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail
But I never sat back feelin sorry for myself
If you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell
'Til it's heaven


[Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson]
Justify my thug for you
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
To justify my thug
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
For you

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Now if you shoot my dog, I'mma kill yo' cat
Just the unwritten laws in rap, know dat
For every action there's a reaction, don't have me relapsin
Relaxin's what I'm about, but about mine
Don't be actin like you can't see street action
Take me back to Reasonable Doubt time
You see my mind's on the finish line, facin the wreck
I put my muh'fuckin faith in the tec, tell Satan not yet
You understand I am chasin my breath
I am narrowly escapin my death, oh yes
I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster
Travellin Mach 5, barrel in my apparel can stop God
God forgive me but I can't let them deliver me to you
Until, I won this race, then eventually
My engine gon' burn out, I get whatever is meant for me
However it turns out fine, red line!


[Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson]
Justify my thug for you
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
To justify my thug
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
For you

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wronged and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? (Good question, right?)
'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin tight as lemons on the ave
Tryin to cop a shop - call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up
Every other corner there's a liquor store, fuck is up?

[Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson]
Justify my thug for you
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
To justify my thug
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
For you

[Intro: Paul McCartney]
Good evening, sir, how are you?

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I got lumps in my throat
When I saw her comin' down the aisle
I got the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeah, she's lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Meanwhile, I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got the chance, I oughta take it
If she'll dance, then we can make it
Come on, Queenie, let's shake it

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Go, go, go, little Queenie
Go, go, go, little Queenie
I said, Go, go, go, little Queenie
Ahh, go, go, go, go!

[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Meanwhile, well, she's thinkin'
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, I'm gonna get it
And if it's good, she'll admit it
Said, c'mon queenie, Ahh

So many promising lies
How must I forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes?

You've broken my heart
Gonna do it again
And I can't forget

Lonesome tears in my eyes

Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]

Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

I see the love of the loved

Someday they'll see that from the start
My place has been deep in your heart
And in your heart
I see the love of the loved

Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure
You love me

And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me
And say ah you love me

So let it rain, I'll never care
Deep in your heart, I'll still be there
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved

Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure
You love me

And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me
And say ah you love me

So let it rain, I'll never I care
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there
And when I'm there

I see the love of the loved
I see the love of the loved
I see the love of the loved

[Lee Peters] But now, John has his work cut out on the next one
As he takes his guitar on and off his neck and pulls the harmonica in and out of his face
[John] Harp. It's a harp
[Lee] What? Harp?
[John] The harp. Because I'm playing the harp on this one
[Lee] Playing the harp?
[John] Harmonica I play on "Love Me Do," harp, on this one, little goes in the orange
[Lee] But it goes in and out? Do you want to do this announcement?
Well, go on, you go ahead, no, it's all right. Tell them. Tell them about the next song
[John] Oh, er, we'd like to carry on with Chuck Berry's "I Got to Find My Baby"
Don't know where she's been, pardon, hello? Love these goon shows

I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

[Refrain 1]
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

[Verse 2]
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

[Refrain 2]
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

[Interlude]

[Refrain 2]
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins you'll see

[Refrain 3]
I'll make love to you
If you want me to

Lucille
Please come back where you belong
Well I'm talking to you baby
I'll never put you on
Aaaah! Wah!

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Towering over your head

Joan was quizzical;
Studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

[Verse 2]
His sister Shirley works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
It's the only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

[Chorus 2]
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man (Hey!)

[Bridge]
Mean Mr. Mustard
Such a dirty, dirty
Mean Mr. Mustard
Such a dirty, dirty
Mean Mr. Mustard
(Such a dirty, dirty)
Oh yeah brother, come here
I'll grip your-grip your thigh

[Verse 1]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper (shoot)
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

[Outro]
He's such a mean old man
Such a mean old man
[Unintelligible]




Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road, yes he does
Saving up to buy some clothes, yes he is
He keeps a ten-bob note up his nose, yes he does
He's such a mean old man, yes he is
He's such a mean old man, yes he is

His sister Shelly works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
She's slaving up to look at the queen, god save the queen
Only place that he's ever been, god save the queen
Always shouts out something obscene
He's such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

[Intro]
I don't care if I spent my dough
Night going to be

[Verse 1]
Going to rock it up
Going to shake it up
Going to roll it up
Have them ball tonight

Rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul

Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said to my soul:
You're the devil in a frying pan

Well I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul

You can knock me down
Slap my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do
But oh oh honey
Lay off of them shoes

[Chorus]
Now don't you step
On my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes

Ah go!

You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar
Do anything
That you want to do
But ah ah honey
Lay off of them shoes

[Chorus]

Ah go, hit it, Carl!

Well blue blue
Blue suede shoes

But lay off of them blue suede shoes




Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
'cause my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge

Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry homedrops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag, misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

[Verse 3]
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one, lonely one

[Intro]
Woo! Geah, geah (Young) geah
Uhh, turn the music up, turn the lights down
I'm in my zone

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 1]
Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
Put that in the eggshell, standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church, pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like, "Damn, that man's face is just like my face"
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homie, you got caught
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in Heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!


[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse

I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out

Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 2]
Music business hate me 'cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it, yet they all yell "holla"
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill' - I ain't been rhyming like Common since (wooo!)
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception! Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them (rims, that is)


[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 3]
My homie Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall
'Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See, in my inner circle, all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, 'cause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago, prepared the flow
Prepared for war, I should fear no man
You don't hear me though, these words ain't just 'pared to go
In one ear, out the other ear, no!
Yo, my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars will scab
What, you gonna box me, homie? I can dodge a jab
Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK, nigga, holla back!


[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse

I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out

Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour
Step right this way

Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away, take you today

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away


Wo, wo, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Whoa

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride
And she don't care


Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Y'all wanna know why he don't stop?
Y'all wanna know why he don't flop?
Let me tell you pe-people why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out selling dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin' merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some Just Me, Myself and I
On some Trugoy shit
Had to voyage to a place of, to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Like I never rode in a limo
Like I just dropped flows to a demo
Like it's '92 again and I got O's in the rental
Back in the Stu' again
No prob' livin' was a whole lot simple
When you think back, you thought that
You would never make it this far
Then you take advantage of the luck you handed
Or the talent you been given
Ain't no half steppin', ain't no, no slippin'
Ain't no different from a block that's hittin'
Gotta get it while the getting's good
Gotta strike while the iron's hot, before you stop
Then you gotta bid it, good riddance
Goodbye! This is my second major breakup
My first was with a pager
With a hooptie, a cookpot and the GAME
This one's with the stu', with the stage, with the fortune
Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst like the first song I sang

Your accounting was crazy wrong and shit
But we still put it together
Biggs, whassup?

What up, Ty? Hip-Hop, whattup, man?
Aye, aye Hop, you ain't, you ain't have no uhh

[Pre-Chorus]
My Bonnie lies over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over the ocean
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me

[Verse 1]
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face

[Verse 2]
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

[Bridge]
If I were you, I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply


[Verse 2]
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

[Outro]
No reply, no reply

Control room: No reply, take one!
One two three four, one

This happened once before
When I came to your door no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light
I know that you saw me
Cause I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home that's a lie
Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door (your face)
I nearly died
Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
Your face

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

This happened once before (oh yeah)
When I came to your door no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through-- your face




[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"

[Bridge 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"

[Bridge 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?

[Verse 1]
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

[Verse 2]
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh

[Chorus]
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time

[Verse 1: George Harrison]
I found it out, what love is all about
And every day, it sure lets out
I see my baby, I get weak in the knees
'Cause nothin's shakin' but the leaves on the tree
My papi told me there'd be times like these
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
We meet the gang and go to rockin' Joe's
The cats are something on the heels and toes
I grab my baby, tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be such a dog-gone tease?
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

[Pre-Chorus: George Harrison]
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please

[Chorus: George Harrison]
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah

[Verse 1: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

[Verse 2: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

[Bridge 1: John Lennon]
Nowhere man, please, listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command

He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man, can you see me at all?

Nowhere man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all 'till somebody else lends you a hand

[Verse 1]
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me

[Chorus]
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found

[Chorus]
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe (Happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you

[Outro]
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

[Verse 2]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you (Wooo!)
Don't ever leave me alone

[Bridge]
When you told me, you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me, that you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died

[Verse 3]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

[Verse 1]
I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

[Verse 2]
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

[Chorus 2]
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Bridge]
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me, hey

[Instrumental Verse]

[Bridge]
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

[Verse 3]
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late, hey

[Chorus 3]
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Outro]
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you

[Verse 1]
My baby said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Verse 2]
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Chorus]
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said "you've got the wrong location"
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

[Verse 1]
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line

She said she's travelling on the one after 909

Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line

Said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

Said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

She said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over, honey, I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909
Oh, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Well, my baby said she's travelling on the one after-

[Chorus]
Said she's travelling on the one after 909
Oh!

Well, My baby said she's traveling on the one after 909
She said move over honey, I'm traveling on that line
She said move over once, Move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
She said she's traveling on the one after 909

[Verse 2]
I begged her not to go, and I begged her on my bended knees
She said you're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Chorus]
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said "you've got the wrong location"
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find you've got the number wrong

[Verse 3]
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Verse 3]
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice

Said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hopin' every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

Can't you see when I'm holding you near
All the things I do
Show my love, and I'm making it clear
One and one is two

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hopin' every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

Can't you see I've loved you from the start?
Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
If you only knew

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hopin' every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"


If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything's alright
All the world would look so fine
If you'll be mine tonight

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hoping every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

[Verse 1]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote it like that

[Verse 2]
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

[Chorus 1]
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 2]
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

[Verse 3]
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one there


[Verse 1]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
I just wrote it like that

[Verse 2]
When you listen late at night
You may feel the words are not quite right
But they are
I just wrote them myself

[Chorus 1]
And it doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

[Instrumental Verse]

[Chorus 2]
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

[Verse 3]
If you think the harmony
Is a little off and out of key
Then you're right
'Cause I sing it myself

[Intro]
Ooh! My soul

[Chorus]
Well baby baby baby baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey honey honey honey
Said get off of that money
Love love love love
Ooh! My soul

[Verse]
Well give me give me give me give me give me
Give me all the love you got
Baby baby baby baby
Don't you know I want a lot
Love love love love
Ooh! My soul

[Chorus] [x2]

(All): (Singing)
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
Ev'rywhere it's song.
London, Paris, Rome and New York,
Tokyo, Hong Kong.
Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
And I'm off to join the cheer!
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
At the end of ev'ry year!
Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
At the end of ev'ry year!
I said that ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
At the end of ev'ry year!
One more time now!
Ev'rywhere it's Christmas....

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job, so I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer!

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
It's a dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job, but he wants to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer!

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer (writer, writer)

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, (Lennon & Harrison), McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
It's a thousand pages, give or take a few (Frere)
I'll be writing more in a week or two (Jacques)
I could make it longer if you like the style (Frere)
I can change it 'round and I want to be a paperback writer (Jacques)
Paperback writer!

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney, (Lennon & Harrison), McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
If you really like it, you can have the rights (Frere)
It could make a million for you overnight (Jacques)
If you must return it, you can send it here (Frere)
But I need a break, and I want to be a paperback writer (Jacques)
Paperback writer!

I'm Pedro the fisherman
I fish by night and day
Unfortunately i live in Bristol
Far far away

And there ain't no fish to be caught
No fish to be caught
There ain't no sea
The council came
Away from me

I'm Pedro the fisherman
With not a fish to fash
I've got a hook on the line
A big mac, a big hat
Some socks, a pair of wellingtons
And a bit of wine
(A lot of wine)

So I'm going to go

[Verse 1]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

[Verse 1]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

[Piccolo trumpet solo]

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain

There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

[Outro]
(Instrumental)
A suitable ending, I think!

[Verse 1]
Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies, life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

[Verse 2]
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

[Bridge]
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their life, there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking!

[Verse 3]
Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

[Outro]
One more time

[Intro]
(Wait!)
Oh yes, wait a minute, Mister Postman
(Wait!)
Wait, Mister Postman

[Chorus 1]
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh yeah!
(Is there a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, Mister Postman
(I've been waiting a long, long time)
Oh yeah!
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)

[Verse 1]
There must be some word someday
From my girlfriend so far away
Please, Mister Postman look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me
I've been standing here waiting, Mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returning home to me

[Chorus 2]
Please, Mister Postman!
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh yeah!
(Is there a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, Mister Postman
(I've been waiting a long, long time)
Oh yeah!
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)

[Verse 2]
So many days you passed me by
See the tear standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter

[Chorus 3]
Mister Postman!
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Look and see
If there's a letter, oh yeah, for me
(Is there a letter in your bag for me)
I've been waiting such a long time
(I've been waiting a long, long time)
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)

[Outro]
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah!
(Mister Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah, you got to
(Mister Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah!
(Mister Postman)

[Verse 1]
Last night, I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you

[Verse 2]
You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say, love?

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on), Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on), Come on (Come on)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you

[Bridge]
I don't want to sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart (In my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you it's so hard to reason
With you, whoa yeah, why do you make me blue?

[Verse 3]
Last night, I said these words to my girl
I know I never even try girl

[Verse 1]
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes "The News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hey!) Great!

[Just Blaze]
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, OH, H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov!
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, OH-not D.O.C
But similar to them letters, "No One Can Do it Better"
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homey Strict told me, "Dude finish your breakfast"
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors (*laughing*)
This ain't a movie, dog (Oh shit)

[Interlude: Just Blaze]
Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm gone!
And I don't care what you think about me-but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you Jack!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Thing ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my "by any means" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone

[Verse 1]
If the rain comes
They run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes

When the sun shines
They slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down) And sip their lemonade
(When the sun shines down) When the sun shines
When the sun shines (Sun shines)

[Chorus]
Rain
I don't mind
Shine
The weather's fine

[Verse 2]
I can show you
That when it starts to rain
(When the rain comes down) Everything's the same
(When the rain comes down) I can show you
I can show you (Show you)

[Chorus]
Rain
I don't mind
Shine
The weather's fine

[Verse 3]
Can you hear me
That when it rains and shines
(When it rains and shines) It's just a state of mind
(When it rains and shines) Can you hear me
Can you hear me (Hear me)

[Verse 1]
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

[Chorus 1]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Piano interlude]

[Verse 2]
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

[Chorus 2]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Guitar solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 3]
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone

[Chorus 3]
It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

[Verse 1]
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me
She sailed at the dawning, all day I've been blue
Red sails in the sunset, I'm trusting in you

[Verse 2]
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one home, yeah, safely to me
Ow!

Swift wings you must borrow
Make straight for the shore
Well, we marry tomorrow
And she goes sailing no more

Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me

Well, we marry tomorrow
And she goes sailing away no more

Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me

[Outro]
Yeah, home safely to me

[Intro]
Gentlemen, hello

[Verse 1]
I'm just sitting here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissing, baby, oh oh baby
I've been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town
You don't love me anymore
I'll get over you, baby
Although my heart's still sore
You know my heart's still sore

[Verse 2]
Well, I think of all the lies you told
You're a junk man, my heart you sold
You're a cheater and a mean mistreater
When I think of all the fun we had
Kind of makes me feel so sad
And I'm lonely for your love and as long as I live
It's only you I'll be thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of

[Intro]
Aah!

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead

[Pre-Chorus 3]
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

Well, you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know

Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution

Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

[Spoken Intro: Alistair Taylor & George Martin]
...bottle of claret for you if I'd realised
I'd forgotten all about it, George, I'm sorry
Well do next time
Will you forgive me?
Mmmyes
Cheeky bitch

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number

[Verse 1]
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen time your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

[Verse 2]
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

[Bridge]
Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
Right!
Right!

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

[Verse 3]
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have brought this specimen


I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

With the situation

They are standing still

Upon the telegram

Ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

Ooh

[Verse 4]
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

[Pre-Chorus]
Alright!


[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

[Verse 5]
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

Block that kick, block that kick!

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

[Verse 6]
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El Dorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

[Verse 7]
Maybe even then
Exposure could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked
If you become naked

[Outro]
Hold that line, hold that line!
Block that kick, block that kick!

[Chorus]
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 1]
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 3]
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

[Chorus]
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 4]
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano


[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Chorus]
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it

[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Chorus]
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

[Chorus]
And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

[Outro]
C'mon, Rocky boy
C'mon, Rocky boy

One, two, three, four
Two, three, four, yeah

[SPOKEN]

He was a fool unto himself

Rocky Raccoon
Rocky Raccoon
He was a fool unto himself
And he would not swallow his foolish pride
Mind you, coming from a little town in Minnesota
It was not the kind of thing that a young guy did
When a fellow went and stole his chick away from him

[SUNG]

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

The doctor walked in sminking of gin (laugh) [Sminking?]
And proceeded to lie on the table
He's really sminking of gin
And it did him in the end [Poor doc.]

Meantime back on the table, yeah
The doctor said, "Rock, you met your match, son"
Rocky said, "it's only a scratch, son
I'll be better soon"
"You better be, better soon," said the doc
Come on son, gotta get hip
Gotta get up
Gotta get back to your gun
Gotta go shoot at, Danny Boy

However, Rocky Raccoon fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

Da da da da...
That's the story of the Rocky Raccoon

[SPOKEN]
Now Rocky Racoon
Got up from his room and he walked out through the swing doors of the local saloon
Straight into the arms of someone new
Someone who he'd known from a long way back
Maybe from his primary school days
A young friend Rocky recognized


[HALF-SPOKEN-HALF-SUNG]
He said, "honey, will you be my new honey-bunch"
She said "Rocky boy, come on, I'll show you why I love you."
"Young Rocky Racoon, I love the way you wear your hat
Love the way you hid your pants, Rocky Raccoon, I dig you"

He said, "missus, I dig you too, come with me"

[Verse 1: George Harrison]
Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3: George Harrison]
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two

[Verse 4: George Harrison]
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 5: George Harrison]
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 6: George Harrison]
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

[Outro: George Harrison]
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

[Verse 1: George Harrison]
Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3: George Harrison]
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two

[Verse 4: George Harrison]
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

[Verse 5: George Harrison]
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 6: George Harrison]
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

Every dance with the guy
Who gave you the eye
Let him hold you tight

You can smile
Every smile for the man
Who held your hand
'Neath the pale moonlight

But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm

Oh I know
That the music is fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun

Laugh and sing
But while we're apart
Don't give your heart
To anyone

But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm

Baby don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go

You can dance
Go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go

If he asks
If you're all alone
Can he take you home
You must tell him no

Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'

Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's Good News
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Verse 2]
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down the blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Bridge 1]
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud

She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are

"Listen to that, Mal
Oh look out! It's-"

[Verse 1]
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

[Verse 2]
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born"

I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Bridge]
She said, "you don't understand what I said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Verse 4]
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Outro]
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead"

She said
I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born
I said
Who put all those things in your head
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born
She said you don't understand what I said
I said oh no no, you're wrong, when I was a boy
Everything was right
Everything was right
I said
Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born
She said you don't understand what I said
I said oh no no, you're wrong, when I was a boy
Everything was right
Everything was right

Caus you're making me feel like I've never been born

[Verse 1]
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

[Verse 2]
She don't give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me
Say that I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving, don't ask me why

[Bridge]
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

[Verse 1]
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant

Fooling, I know she isn't

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years


[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Outro]
She's leaving home (Bye-bye)

If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you

So darling, darling stand by me

I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Verse 2]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus 1]
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always know sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean, ah yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus 2]
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real

I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree


[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields

And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

Home where the old folks stay

All the world is sad and dreary
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home


Well let me tell you well no chick made could be the same
As Sweet Georgia Brown
Crazy feet that dance so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown
Fella's sigh, and even cry for Sweet Georgia Brown
I tell you just why you know I don't lie

It's been said, she knocks them dead in any old town
Since she came right it's a shame how she brings them down
In Liverpool she even dare to criticize the Beatles' hair
With their whole fan club standing there, I mean Sweet Georgia Brown
Alright

I say this group is absolutely marvelous with the piano
Don't you think so?
Not too commercial boys, not too commercial!

When it comes to music Sweet Georgia known to mind
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist
I never would try to tell you just why use your imagination

There's a DJ crazy for her living in out home town
Since she came like it's a shame, she turns him down
Records that she can get are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina, but that don't have Georgia Brown

Oh such Sweet Georgia
Yeah yeah yeah I mean brown, oh oh oh
Sweet Georgia Brown

My tears are falling
'cos you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There something that I got to say:

Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do

Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint rainbows all around her
Don't let her see the cloudy sky

Once upon a time
That little girl was mine

If I had been true
I know she'd never been with you

So take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me


Take good care of my baby

Take good care of my baby

If i don't get a kiss from you

Take out some insurance on me baby

Mama don't worry
Your Teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"

[Chorus 1]
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine, and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot

[Chorus 2]
A friend says that a love is never true
But you know this can't apply to you
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
And when she says she loves you, that means a lot

[Verse]
Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide what you feel
When it's real?

[Chorus 3]
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
But you know that your love is all you've got
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it O.K
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you
But your soul - think!"

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 5: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Outro]


[John] Mal?

[Mal Evans] Hello

[John] Un string avec caput, Mal!
We gotta get faster, Ringo!

[Paul] Okay, George!

[John] Okay?

[Verse 1]
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance

[Chorus]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 2]
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it O.K
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"


[Chorus]
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 3]
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton

You know how hard it can be

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 1]
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents, he always took his mum
He's the all American, bullet-headed, Saxon mother's son
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 2]
Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 3]
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 1]
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Verse 2]
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

{Instrumental bridge}

[Verse 3]
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Round and round and round and round and round

[Verse 4]
And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

[Chorus]
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Outro]
Oh (Round and round and round)
Oh


[Verse]
I never knew that a day like today lay before us
I've got the sun in my heart and my heart's in the sun
The skys are as bright as your eyes the horizon is open
Love is the ceiling feeling are reeling free as the air

[Chorus]
Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but are we who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love

[Chorus]
Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but we are who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love


I never knew that a day like today lay before us
I've got the sun in my heart and my heart's in the sun
Skies are as bright as your eyes
The horizon is open
Love is the ceiling
Feelings are reeling
Free as the air

Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Who ever knew that we two could be free as we'd fancy?
Fancy is free
But are we who are bound to each other by love?
To each other by love
Who ever knew that we two could be free as we'd fancy?
Fancy is free
But are we who are bound to each other by love?
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love

[Verse]
Without going out of my door
I can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

[Verse]
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of Heaven

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing

[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

[Bridge]
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried

[Verse 3]
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

[Orchestral Solo]

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you've always known
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me standing here
Lead me to you door
[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

You Never Give Me Your Money

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go

But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go


[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

[Verse 1]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose


Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

[Verse 2]
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Her Majesty

[Verse]
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine

Polythene Pam

[Verse 1]
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes "The News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
(Yeah!) Great!
Fab!
Isn't that great?
It's real good, that
Real good
Listen to that, Mal
Oh look out! It's-

She Came In Through the Bathroom Window

[Verse 1]
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

[Verse 2]
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah

Golden Slumbers

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse: Paul McCartney]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Carry That Weight

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Verse 1]
We said our goodbyes (Ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)
Now, today, I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

[Verse 2]
Were you telling lies? (Ah, the night before?)
Was I so unwise? (Ah, the night before?)
When I held you near, you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

[Bridge]
Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did, it makes me wanna cry

When I held you near, you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before




[Verse 1]
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

[Chorus 1]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Piano interlude]

[Verse 2]
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

[Chorus 2]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Guitar solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 3]
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone

[Chorus 3]
It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

[Verse 1]
There-
There's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

[Bridge]
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

[Verse 3]
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

There's a place
There's a place

I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

[Bridge]
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

[Verse 3]
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone


[Outro]
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place

[Chorus]
Well I'm the sheik of Araby
Your love belongs to me
Well at night where you're asleep
Into your tent I'll creep
(Not 'alf!)

[Verse 1]
The stars that shine above
Will light our way to love
Ah you rule this world with me
I'm the sheik of Araby

[Chorus]
Well I'm the sheik of Araby
Your love belongs to me
Well at night where you're asleep
Into your tent I'll creep

Well I'm the sheik of Araby, yeah


[Outro]
(The sheik of Araby)

Well I know you heard of Suzy-Q
And I know you heard of the chicken too
I know you heard of the cha-cha-choo
Cause the walk is a dance that you can do
You just walk, you just walk
Oh you walk, yes you walk
Yeah you walk, it has to walk
Well I know you heard of the Texas Hop
I know you heard of the old Fox Trot
But when you do The Walk
You ride each car
You just shake your hips and close your eyes
And then you walk, yeah you walk
Then you walk, oh you walk, ah you walk
Oh yes you walk
Do the walk, boys!
[Instrumental]
Well I know you heard of the old mambo
And I know you heard of the old congo
But when you do the walk
You're startin to get close
And don't step on your partners toes!
You just walk, yeah you walk, then you walk
Yes you walk, oh you walk, just the walk
Now if you don't know what it's all about
Come to me and I'll show you how
Well do it fast, well do it slow
Then you'll know the walk everywhere you go
You can walk, and you walk, now you walk
You gonna walk, you gotta walk it
Just a walk
Just a walk
Just a walk
Just a walk



[Verse 1]
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Bridge 1]
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good

[Verse 2]
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Bridge 2]
Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read

[Verse 3]
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Bridge 3]
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light

[Verse 4]
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Outro]
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 2]
You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

[Bridge]
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough


[Verse 3]
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck

Love me all the time, girl

Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 1]
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 2]
You say you'll be mine, girl

[Verse 1]
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Verse 2]
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you


[Verse 3]
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Outro]
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Verse 1: John Lennon and & Paul McCartney]
That boy took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry

[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

That boy
Took my love away

[Verse]
Three cool cats
Three cool cats
Are coming up in a beat up car
Spitting up a lift of candy bar
Talking on about how sharp they are
Three cool cats

Three cool chicks
Are walking down the street
Swinging their hips
Splitting up a bag of potato chips
I think cool cats really did flip
Three cool chicks
Yeah three cool chicks

[Pre-Chorus]
Well up came that first cool cat
He said, "Man look at that
Man, do you see what I see?"
"Well I want that middle chick"
"I want that little chick"
"Hey man save one chick for me"
Hey, well three cool chicks
Three cool chicks

[Chorus]
Well they love like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
But three cool chicks
Made three fools out of three cool cats
Three cool cats

Three cool cats

She's got a ticket to ride

She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

[Verse 2]
She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free when I was around

[Chorus]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me

[Verse 3]
I think I'm going to be sad, I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away, yeah

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free when I was around

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

[Verse 2]
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

[Bridge]
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

[Verse 3]
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

[Verse 2]
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

[Verse 3]
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

[Verse 5]
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

[Verse 6]
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

[Outro]
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning

Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Too bad about sorrows

There'll be no tomorrow
For all of your love

You said you were sleeping
But I can't forget
The troubles you're leaving
Don't be like that

I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]

On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home


[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I have memories

In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Verse 1]
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (Your mother should)
Your mother should know (know)
Sing it again
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago

[Verse 1: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

[Chorus 1: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Verse 2: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

[Chorus 2: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

[Verse 3: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home

[Outro]


Standing in the garden waiting for the sun to shine
Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine
Everybody does think a thing it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some

Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Looking at the bench of next door neighbors
Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers
Everybody's got to have something hard to hold
Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
You gotta get out son and make you one

Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know
Shoot big
Shoot big

Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big
You gotta shoot big
Until you shoot big

I can't stand it

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again


[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way

We can work it out
We can work it out



Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
All right, hey, hey, all right now
See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
All right, hey, hey, mmm, all right now
Ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ohh
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good
Mmm, see the girl with the red dress on
She can do the dog all night long
All right, hmm what'd I say, tell me what'd I say
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say
Ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ohh

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 1]
The other day I saw you as I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you, I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 2]
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I used to think of no one else but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?




What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind




[Speech]

[Rodney Burke] Uh, George is just coming up here with a letter in his hand, you're looking very serious about it, what is it, George?

[George] It's a letter from Cathy of Newport, Isle of Wight, who says: "Paul's been to to the Isle of Wight, why haven't I?" Well, I haven't got the passport, huh. And, and she says, would you please sing a song, uh, for the 5th of St. Teresa [?] Isle of Wight? So we'd like to feature John shouting: "Soldiers of Love."

[Rodney] Alright


[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood or this pop, this hot or this strong
With so many different flows, this one's for this song
The next one I switch up, this one will get bit up
These fucks, too lazy to make up shit, they crazy
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me
You know what? Soon they forget where they plucked
Their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome
I'm like, "TAA!"
I'm not a biter, I'm a writer for myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only biggin' up my brother
Biggin' up my borough, I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish (Whoo!)
So them rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
I'm in, new sneakers, dual-seaters, few divas
What more can I tell you? Let me spell it for you:
W-I, double-L, I-E
Nobody truer than H-O-V
And I'm back for more, New York's ambassador
Prime Minister, back to finish my business up

[Interlude: George Harrison]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping


[Chorus: Hum-V]
What more can I say?
What more can I do?
What-what more?

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
What more can I say to you? You heard it all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You already know what I'm about: flyin' birds down South
Movin' wet off the step, purple rain in a drought
Stuntin' on hoes, brushin' off my shirt
But ain't nothin' on my clothes 'cept my chain, my name
Young H-O, pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol, I make payroll
Benz paid for, friends they roll
Private jets down to Turks and Caicos
Cris' caseloads, I don't give a shit
Nigga, one life to live, I can't let a day go
By without me bein' fly, fresh to death
Head to toe 'til the day I rest
And I don't wear jerseys, I'm 30-plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga, button-ups
S. Dots on my feet make my cipher complete
What more can I say? Guru, play the beat!


[Break: Jay-Z (Hum-V)]
My nigga, hahahaha, woo!
We gon' let this ride into the hook
- I'ma snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you?
- Get my grown man on
LET'S GO!
(What more can I sayyyyyyyyyyy?)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag
For like half a billy and your ass ain't lily-White
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly, it's both!
I don't mean to boast, but damn, if I don't brag
Them crackers gon' act like I ain't on they ass
The Martha Stewart that's far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it
In fact, I'm just previewin' it
This ain't the show, I'm just EQin' it
One-two and I won't stop abusin' it
To groupie girls: stop false accusin' it
Back to the music - the Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem, Houston!
What up B, they can't shut up me
Shut down I, not even P.E., I'ma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly what these streets did to me
So picture me lettin' these clowns nitpick at me
Paint me like a pickany
I will literally kiss Ti-Ti in the forehead
Tell her, "Please forgive me," then squeeze into your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off, in fact
I got a joint that'll knock your points off
Young Hova the God, nigga, blast for me
I'm at the Trump International, ask for me
I ain't never scared, I'm everywhere, you ain't never there
And nigga, why would I ever care?
Pound for pound, I'm the best to ever come around here
Excludin' nobody, look what I embody:
The soul of a hustler, I really ran the street
A CEO's mind, that marketin' plan was me
And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated like, say, a Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat' a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culture
I'm supposed to be number one on everybody list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this man!


[Outro: Hum-V]
What more can I sayyyyyyyyyyy?

[Verse 1]
She looks as an African Queen
She eating twelve chapattis and cream
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
She coming from out of Bahran

[Verse 1]
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

[Verse 2]
You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

[Chorus]
I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me

[Verse 3]
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

Whoa-I, whoa-I

I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say to her

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I

When I get home

[Bridge]
When I'm getting home tonight

I'm going to love her till the cows come home
I bet I'll love her more
Till I walk out that door
Again

[Verse 3]
Come on, let me through
I've got so many things I've got to do
I've got no business being here with you
This way

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home




We shall scrimp and save




[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge 1]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 2]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge 2]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

[Verse 3]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Outro]
Whoo!


[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?

If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride

[Verse 5: Paul McCartney]
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?


[Verse 6: Paul McCartney]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

[Verse 7: Paul McCartney]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away

[Verse 8: Paul McCartney]
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Outro]
Whoo!

Take 2!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?


[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave, doo-be-doo

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Whoo!

We are traveling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)

Oh when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the moon turns red with blood
When the moon turns red with blood
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

On that hallelujah day
On that hallelujah day
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in


Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed

When the revelation (revolution) comes
When the revelation (revolution) comes
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the rich go out and work
When the rich go out and work
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the air is pure and clean
When the air is pure and clean
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When we all have food to eat
When we all have food to eat
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When our leaders learn to cry
When our leaders learn to cry
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Since we kissed I never knew the thrills I could have tasted
Since we kissed I never knew the years that I was wasting
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life?
Oh don't you know that until we touched I never knew the touch was of revealing
Until we touched I never knew my heart was really beating
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life
Oh where you've been, where you've been
[Solo]
Now don't you know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was feeling blue
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was needing you
Oh where you've been, where you've been
Where you've been
Darling where have you been all my life

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Bridge 1]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

[Verse 2]
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr]
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full steam ahead, Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!

[Verse 4: Ringo Starr & Paul McCartney]
As we live a life of ease
Every one of us (Every one of us) has all we need (Has all we need)
Sky of blue (Sky of blue) and sea of green (Sea of green)
In our yellow (In our yellow) submarine (Submarine, ha-ha!)

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine

Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 2]
In the morning
Want to die
In the evening
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 4]
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 5]
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Want to die
Yeah, want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why


[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 1]
In the morning want to die
In the evening want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 2]
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones


[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 3]
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Intro]
[Unintelligible]
Yeah
Oh

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 1]
In the morning want to die
In the evening want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

My mother was of the earth
My father was of the sky
But I am of the universe
And that's the reason why:

[Chorus]
I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why


[Verse 2]
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he eats my bones
I feel so insecure now
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 3]
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Interlude]
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why


[Outro]
Yes I'm lonely
Yes I'm lonely
Yes I'm lonely
Yes I'm lonely
Yes I'm lonely
(Yes I'm lonely)
Yes I'm lonely




[Verse 1]
If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more, it's true
Yes it is

[Verse 2]
Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

[Bridge]
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

[Verse 3]
"Please don't wear red tonight"
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

[Bridge]
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

[Bridge]
(Mumbling)
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

[Verse 3]
"Please don't wear red tonight"
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

And it goes E minor to A seventh to D minor
Ready

[Verse 1]
I've got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I'm going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

[Verse 2]
Well, it's the second time I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it's a sin
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

[Bridge]
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

[Verse 3]
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that!

You know what to do

I hope that you won't mind if I walk you back home

And if you want me just like I need you

[Verse 1]
Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Verse 2]
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Bridge]
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

[Verse 3]
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Refrain]
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Bridge]
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me

'Cause you like me too much and I like you

Always shine (always shine)
You'll be mine (you'll be mine)
You'll be mine
And the stars (and the stars)
Always shine (always shine)
You'll be mine

[Verse 2]
(My darling
When you brought me that toast the other morning
I, I looked into you eyes
And I could see that National Health eyeball
And I loved you, like I've never done
Like I've never done before!)

[Chorus]
Well the stars (well the stars)
They shine (oh, they shine)
And you'll be mine
Oh, you will be mine
You'll be mine
At the star (at the star)
Always shining



[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

[Instrumental break 1:49-2:29]

[Verse 4]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

[Verse 1]
I saw her standing on the corner (Yip yip boom)
A yellow ribbon in her hair (Yip yip boom)
I couldn't stop myself from calling
Well look a-there, look a-there
Wow look a-there, well look a-there
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

[Verse 2]
I took one look and I was fractured (Yip yip boom)
I tried to walk but I was lame (Yip yip boom)
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
Well what's your name, what's your name
Well what's your name, well what's your name
Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

[Verse 3]
A crazy stop, she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!

[Verse 4]
Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered (Yip yip boom)
I saw the rising of the sun (Yip yip boom)
And all along my heart was falling
While you're the one, you're the one
While you're the one, ah you're the one
Young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind



[Verse 1]
I saw her standing on the corner (Yip yip boom)
A yellow ribbon in her hair (Yip yip boom)
I couldn't stop myself from calling
Well look a-there, look a-there
Wow look a-there, well look a-there
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

[Verse 2]
I took one look and I was fractured (Yip yip boom)
I tried to walk but I was lame (Yip yip boom)
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
Well what's your name, what's your name
Well what's your name, well what's your name
Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

[Verse 3]
A crazy stop, she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!

[Verse 4]
Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered (Yip yip boom)
I saw the rising of the sun (Yip yip boom)
And all along my heart was falling
While you're the one, you're the one
While you're the one, ah you're the one
Young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

Your feet's too big
(Your feet's too fat!)
Who's that walkin' around?
Go sit, sounds like baby patter to me
[?]

[Verse 1]
Say, up in Harlem at a table for two
There were four of us: me, your big feet, and you
From your ankle up, I'll say you sure are sweet
From there down there's just too much feet

[Chorus]
Yes, your feet's too big
Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Can't use you 'cause you feet's too big
I really hate you 'cause your feet's too big

[Verse 2]
Where'd you get 'em?
Your girl she likes you, she thinks you're nice
Got what it takes to be in paradise
She said likes your face, she likes your array
Man, oh man, them things are too big

[Chorus]
Oh, your feet's too big
Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big
I hate you 'cause your feet's too big

Oh your pedal extremities are colossal
To me, you look like a fossil
You got me walkin', talkin' and squawkin'
'Cause your feet are much too big, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, your feet's too big
Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big
I hate you 'cause your feet's too big

Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big

[Verse 1]
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

[Chorus]
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

[Verse 2]
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

[Chorus]
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away


Here I stand, head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and everyday
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you got to hide your love away
Hey, you got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find away?
Gather round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you got to hide your love away
Hey, you got to hide your love away

One, two, three, one, two, three
Hold on, hold on
I was off on that one
Alright, I'm just gonna raise this so it's near the bass strings and the top string

Paul's broken a glass, broken a glass
Paul's broken a glass, a glass, a glass, he's broke today

Okay, one, oh, you ready?
Okay, one, two, three, one, two, three

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare

And I hear them say

[Verse 1]
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have heard enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away

[Chorus]
And you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing


[Verse 3]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)
