
My hands on you, don't make me want to leave
I understand you've always wanted someone not like me
But I don't wanna keep it all this to myself

Verse 1
Don't look down
Cause it's easy
Falling from force
Just let it get
Take natures course
Then pickin' it up
When it's over
Don't be afraid
Cause the chances
Are there for the take
But treasure the
Choices you make
And know when you
Must take it slower

[Pre-Chorus]
You may think you had it rough
And try to give it up
But when you think your stuck
Just go another way

[Chorus]
Don't let go of good times
And let the bad ones know
You feel fine, and wear your
Heart out on your sleeve
Cause love is all
Love is all you need


[Verse 2]
Don't be rushed
Cause hurrying
Causes mistakes
And make sure to
Give more then take
Cause sharing yourself
Brings you closer

[Pre-Chorus]
You may think you had it rough
And try to give it up
But when you think your stuck
Just go another way

[Chorus]
Don't let go of good times
And let the bad ones know
You feel fine, and wear your
Heart out on your sleeve
Cause love is all you need
Feel with all your senses
Make sure to let down your
Defenses, it's just
One way to make you see
That love is all
Love is all you need


[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh, oh
Take a chance now
Cause its easy
Take a chance now
For you and me
Take a chance now
You can reach it
Take a chance with me

[Chorus]
Don't let go of good times
And let the bad ones know
You feel fine, and wear your
Heart out on your sleeve
Love is all you need
Feel with all your senses
Make sure to let down your
Defenses, it's just
One way to make you see

[Outro]
That love is all
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all, love is all
Love is all you need

Rabbits hopping through the fields
Monkeys swinging from the trees
Lions are the king of the forest
But the scariest things alive...

It's dark outside
There's a moonlight
The dark scares me
But I won't believe
That you love me
Cause I know you don't
You're a filthy liar
Who likes Mickeyds
Who orders everything
Cheeseburger and select chicken
What are you talking about
Oh no one important
Ok
A1nyway
Let's say ohhhhhhh
Oh yeah
All night long
Up from top now
Now ohhhhhhhh
All night long
Alright
All night looooooooong
A pretty tired what about you
A little bit tired
What about we wrap this mother up
Wrapping it up, wrapping it up (wrapping it up, wrapping it and wrapping it up)
And scene
Ouch my ears are bleeding




[Verse 1: Selena Gomez & Prince Royce]
Driving all night just to say goodbye
Windows down, hair in the wind
Hang up the phone it'll be a long night
Empty pillows, 2 AM
I cannot pretend I won't be lonely
Every minute that you're gone
But trust me, in the end it will be worth it
Cause baby you're the one

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez & Prince Royce]
I can't even face the daylight
Cause I'm already missing you
Baby, we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you

[Hook: Selena Gomez & Prince Royce]
You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you
You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you (ah, ah, ahh)
Loving you
Loving you

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez & Prince Royce]
I'm missing your touch, I'm missing your smile
Love to feel your hands on my skin
Feeling a rush, it makes me go wild
Crazy how you know what I think
I cannot pretend I won't be lonely
Every minute that you're gone
But trust me, in the end it will be worth it
Cause baby, you're the one

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez & Prince Royce]
I can't even face the daylight
Cause I'm already missing you
Baby, we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you

[Hook: Selena Gomez & Prince Royce]
You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you
You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you

[Bridge: Selena Gomez & Prince Royce, both]
See the clock, close my eyes
Wishing I, could stop the hands of time
Make this kiss, last forever
Forever, we gotta live our lives
But that won't stop me from loving you

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez & Prince Royce]
I can't even face the daylight
Cause I'm already missing you
Baby, we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you

[Hook: Selena Gomez & Prince Royce]
You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you
You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you
Loving you
Loving you

[Outro: Selena Gomez & Prince Royce]
Driving all night just to say goodbye
Windows down, hair in the wind
I'm mad at myself, I'm struggling now
We've done this again and again

[Verse 1]
My friends, they wanna take me to the movies
I tell 'em to fuck off, I'm holding hands with my depression
And right when I think I've overcome it
Anxiety starts kicking in to teach that shit a lesson
Oh, I try my best just to be social
I make all these plans with friends and hope they call and cancel
Then I overthink about the things I'm missing
Now I'm wishing I was with 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like I'm always apologizing for feeling
Like I'm out of my mind when I'm doing just fine
And my exes'll say that I'm hard to deal with
And I admit it, yeah

[Chorus]
But all my friends, they don't know what it's like, what it's like
They don't understand why I can't sleep through the night
I've been told that I could take something to fix it
Damn, I wish it, I wish it was that simple, ah
All my friends they don't know what it's like, what it's like

[Verse 2]
Always wanted to be one of those people in the room
That says something and everyone puts their hand up
Like, "If you're sad, put your hand up
If you hate someone, put your hand up
If you're scared, put your hand up"


[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like I'm always apologizing for feeling
Like I'm out of my mind when I'm doing just fine
And my exes will say that I'm hard to deal with
And I admit it, it's true

[Chorus]
But all my friends, they don't know what it's like, what it's like
They don't understand why I can't sleep through the night
And I thought that I could take something to fix it
Damn, I wish it, I wish it was that simple, ah
All my friends they don't know what it's like, what it's like

[Bridge]
I got all these thoughts, running through my mind
All the damn time and I can't seem to shut it off
I think I'm doing fine most of the time
I think that I'm alright, but I can't seem to shut it off
I got all these thoughts, running through my mind
All the damn time and I can't seem to shut it off
I think I'm doing fine most of the time
I say that I'm alright, but I can't seem to shut it off
Shut it, shut it, yeah

[Chorus]
But all my friends, they don't know what it's like, what it's like
They don't understand why I can't sleep through the night

[Verse 1]
I was looking in the mirror
Tryna find a new reflection
Wanna take the road less travelled down
A different direction
Make some new mistakes
Forget the ones I've made
Cry some tears of joy
Dress more like a boy

[Chorus 1]
And come back as a blonde
Try a different lipstick on
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'll be ever so enticing
Cake, a lot of icing
Never have to watch my weight
Yeah, when I'm gone
I'm gonna come back as a blonde

[Verse 2]
I wanna meet myself
As someone else
Just to see what it feels like
Take a walk on the other side
'Cause you know that I just might
Break some different hearts
Finish what I start
I'm not gonna wait
And mess around with fate

[Chorus 1]
And come back as a blonde
Try a different lipstick on
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'll be ever so enticing
Cake, a lot of icing
Never have to watch my weight
Yeah, when I'm gone
I'm gonna come back as a blonde

[Bridge]
I'm tainted
I'm tired of being the same, yeah
I'm desperate, I'm bored
I'm begging for change
What if you're normal and wanna be strange?
Come back, come back, come back
I wanna come back, come back, come back

[Chorus 1]
As a blonde
Try a different lipstick on
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'll be ever so enticing
Cake, a lot of icing
Never have to watch my weight
Yeah, when I'm gone

[Chorus 2]
I'm gonna come back as a blonde
Wave my magic wand
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'll be ever so enticing
Down a lot of ice cream
Never even wipe my face
Yeah, when I'm gone

[Outro]
I'm gonna come back, come back, come back
(I wanna come back!)
Come back, come back, come back

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter-

[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Place where I can

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Ooh, you'll really wanna know where I've been all this time
So lemme tell ya
Ooh, got two feet on the ground and felt what real is like
What it was like
Livin' out of the scene, out in the wild
Learnin' to breathe
Up in the clouds, far from the crowds
I can't believe I can be loud
Holdin' hands with the darkness and knowin' my heart is allowed
Allowed

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter-

[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Place where I can
Place where I can

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
As I fantasize
So much to see, I'm in paradise, oh, I
Always seems I'm new inside
Deep, deep down in me, I go now, baby, born to fly, oh, I
Now see, how could it be?
We will find our way, we'll find the things we seek, ooh-ee
You see, I'm mesmerized
This is just for me and I am cuttin' ties, goodbye
Ooh, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Is there a place where I can hide away? (Hide away)
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away (All away)
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter-

[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Place where I can
Place where I can

[Bridge: Selena Gomez]
Having no fear (No fear)
Heaven is near (Oh), oh woah
Head is so clear (So clear)
A sweeter place, my sweeter place
Having no fear (No fear)
Heaven is near (Oh), oh woah
Head is so clear (So clear)
My sweeter place, my sweeter place

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Is there a place where I can hide away? (Hide away)
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away (All away)
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter-

Yeah, yeah, ooh
Place where I can
Yeah, yeah, ooh




[Verse 1]
Can you feel me when I think about you?
With every breath I take
Every minute, no matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like I've been wandering the desert for a thousand days (Oh)
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby

[Chorus]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh, oh-oh
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
The stars are burning, I hear your voice in my mind
(Voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me calling?
My heart is yearning, like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me, I'm falling
It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me baby, baby, baby, ooh

So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
And I need you here, I can't explain

[Verse 1]
Took you like I thought
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I'm feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (Even though I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm gettin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
I never got it right
Playin' and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('Cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (Isn't what it could be)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm gettin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to (When I'm not supposed to)
When I'm gettin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)


[Verse 1]
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I'm feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
We never got it right
Playin' and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)


[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]

When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Bridge]
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you


[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)

[Verse 1: Trevor Wentworth & Adam Christopher]
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you

And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two

What was there wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Bridge: Trevor Wentworth, Henrique Baptista, & Matt Wentworth]
You can break my heart in two

It's just a thing you make me do

[Verse 2: Kah-Lo & Selena Gomez]
Thinking, reminiscing
My night's pretty lit, but it's just you missing
Wishing I could be the light in your life
The way still light might bleed through night
Thoughts of you on my mind
I'm searching and I hope one day I can find it
But no one ever feels good, it's never just right
That's why...
I know I'd go back to you

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you

[Verse 3: Kah-Lo & Selena Gomez]
I should be baby-girl living, I know we left messy, but it all is forgiven
Ringing your line, hoping it will go through, and maybe one more time, we could talk this through
Go back to you
Thoughts of you are on my mind
I'm searching and I hope one day I can find it
But no one ever feels good, it's never just right
That's why...
I know I'd go back to you

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you

[Intro: Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (Uh)
So take a look what you've done (Uh)
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (Uh), hey! (Hey!)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at (Uh)
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that? (Remember that?)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more, ah!

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Uh)
You made a really deep cut (Uh)
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey! (Hey!)


[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off? (Uh-huh)
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Uh, uh)
If you love like that, blood runs cold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey! (Bad blood)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!



I know I'm not there for you or there when you call
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm a bad girlfriend





[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room, there's a king-size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you

[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

[Verse 2]
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still, all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar




[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

[Verse 2]
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

Oh, oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been nothing but bad news
Flesh fade in your tattoos
Low life in this high too
You give me love with an attitude
I throw the drink and the glass through
I see your ex and some brand new
I pack my bags and I'm leaving you

[Chorus]
'Cause you've been nothing but bad news, bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
No one to blame, you're bad news
It's such a shame, you're bad news
I had it good for bad news

You took me under
Fuck me right over
Do what I had to
You knew I'd come back to you, baby

I know what I want and I know what I like
You're the one that I'm feeling tonight
You can take me here, here
Take me there, there
Take me wherever you like

[Pre-Chorus]
I act up when I'm up to no good
I got a big brain under this hood
After tonight, you'll discover
You can't tell a book by no cover

And I got my own hand
I'm a one girl motherfuckin' band

You think you see me but I'm like Banksy
Turn up the bass on your speaker
If you really wanna learn
I can teach you

Don't try to leave the dark

Keep it going never stop

Just let me show you why you came, came, came, came
You came cuz I can bang

On your hands and knees grasping for air, grasping for me

Can't go into detail 'til I hear what comes out your mouth (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I can make an educated guess what you're thinkin' 'bout (Tell me what you're thinkin' 'bout)
I could say it on the kiss or it on the stare

[Chorus]
Askin' me what's my type
I say that you're my type
Heard that I like to bite
Baby, then you heard right (Oh)
Askin' me what's my type (Oh)

[Verse 1]
I'm going in, I'm ready to surrender
Like a diamond, I need a little pressure
So press me down till I scream
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

[Chorus]
All I need is your body heat right next to me
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat right next to me
I'm burning up baby, all I want is your body heat
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat

[Verse 2]
I'm restless, I'm craving your attention
My red lips have found a new obsession
Let's go all night, just you and me
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

[Chorus]
All I need is your body heat right next to me
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat right next to me

Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat

[Bridge]
I'm burning up, burning up, you're right there
Your body heat right next to me
I'm burning up, burning up, you're right there
Your body heat right next to me
We're connected by the sun
And all of the stars above
You melt me and my body feels no shame
And I don't care tonight
If it burns too bright
Cause baby, that's why I came

[Chorus]
All I need is your body heat right next to me
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat right next to me

Mom always said that books could take you to another world
But I don't think that this is what she meant
(This is what she meant)
I'm shuttling through these distant lands and ocean shores
Don't really know where I'll go next
'Cause I've been...

Brain Zapped
To a whole new world

Because the light is green, and we're ready to go

[Verse 1]
Dead-end streets and boulevards
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart
But there's a first time for everything
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

[Chorus]
I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride


[Verse 2]
Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

[Chorus]
I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride


[Chorus]

But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride



[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
I can't seem to hide from the lies
I can't disguise myself
I've build these walls so high
And I can't climb myself

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
And just when I feel like fallin' down
You pick me up right off the ground
They can't keep between us two right now

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
(Lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove)
They can't steal our love
(Lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove)
They can't steal our love

I can't seem to choose what to do
There's nothing I can say
I'm tired of the fight 'cause I'm never right
I just wanna cry, no

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
And just when I feel like fallin' down
You pick me up right off the ground
They can't keep between us two right now

They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love

When the world is yours
Then it's mine's and it's yours
And the sunset's ours
I can tell that it's yours [?]

[Verse 1]
There's a reason you're everywhere
Breathe you in like you're in the air
Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
In my room, from the ceiling to the floor
My body knows that you've been here before

[Chorus]
Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne

Give your girl some time to play
Running my mind cause my heart lost all control
Only one thing that can give me that multiple

Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in

[Chorus]
Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne

And I thought that I'd be fine, yeah
When we will say goodbye
Well, well

[Pre-Chorus: Summer Walker]
No, I don't want you but I don't want you and nobody else too
I don't wanna see nobody with you, yeah
It's a catch-22, can't stand I fell for you
You know I'm in love with you but I don't fuck with you
Doubt really givin' it a buck with you, it's an issue

[Chorus: Summer Walker]
Can't you see the feelings that I have are complicated?
It's complicated, no
Don't you see the feeling's complicated?
They complicated

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
Second verse dedicated to the end
I don't even think that we could make amends
We ain't lovers and we can't even be friends
I cannot pretend, shit gets too intense
I can't act like I don't feel nothing
If I see somethin', I might tear that shit down
Burn this shit to the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
And no, I don't want you but I don't want you with nobody else too
I don't wanna see nobody with you, yeah

If I'm really keepin' it a buck with you, it's an issue

People know who the eff I is; I'm a pro
The right time and place for me to be
Yeah, I'll say it, congratulations to me
So here we go, another page in my legacy
Belfast, wait until they get a load of me

But most importantly...

[Chorus]
Congratulations to me
Who's the hostess with the mostest? (Right)

Congratulations to me, yeah
S-E-L-E-N-A to the Gomez
Yeah, you know I'm a dopest

[Verse 2]
Listen up, listen up
It's fucked crazy growing up in this industry
I was still a baby when I hustled up into the scene
Fuck you if you dare stand in front of me
But that's okay, you see, 'cause now I'm the queen
No, no, no I don't wanna be misunderstood
I hope you haters know I've always done the best I could
Don't listen to her Selena, don't let her get in your head
But then again I wish you fuckbutter would

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
It started polite, out on thin ice
'Til you came over to break it
I threw you a line and you were mine
Yeah, I was afraid, but you made it safe
I guess that is our combination
Said you feel lost, well, so do I

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
So won't you call me in the morning?
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same 'cause

Engulfed in the shame
Betrayed by your imagination
In over my head, but that's alright

So won't you call me in the morning?
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same 'cause

[Bridge]
The world keeps on spinning, but I ain't dizzy yet, yeah
The more that you give, give, give, give, the more that you get

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
It's just us two in the crowd, we feel alone
I turn every chair that you sit in into a throne
Not too many of 'em put it down like me
I say it humbly, but they don't wear the crown like me
It's all in your eyes, locked, loaded, we were rolling
You make the whole room feel slow-motion
You make me feel like I'm drowning in a potion
Closed off, tryna get a little open
The more that I give, the more that I get
So baby, I'ma call you in the AM
You're down for my love, honey, say when
I be waitin' on my time 'cause I'm patient

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Look out for Cruella De Vil

[Verse 1]
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
The curl of her lips
The ice in her stare
All innocent children had better beware
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil

[Chorus]
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will

This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She oughta be locked up and never released
This world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella De Vil, yeah!

[Chorus]
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
At first, you think Cruella is a devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realize
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock


[Breakdown]
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I guess I should've known it wasn't gonna end okay
You're such a troublemaker, but I like it just that way
A bomb tick ticking, with neither one of us to blame
Just like a countdown ready to blow
I sat around a lot and thought about the world without you
No matter what you think, everything is not about you
You think I'm still hung up on you, well, baby, it's not true

[Pre-Chorus]
Now look at me
The memories turn to dust
There is only one explanation

[Chorus]
I wasn't really in love (I wasn't really in love)
It was just a crush (It was just a crush)
Sparks fly when we touch, it was never enough
It was just a crush (It was just a crush)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
You throw away the things you need
There's nothing left to lose
The things I never wanna be, I owe it all to you
You just can't help yourself, it's just what you do
'Cause this is real life, not your show

[Pre-Chorus]
Now look at me
The memories turn to dust
There is only one explanation

[Chorus]
I wasn't really in love (I wasn't really in love)
It was just a crush (It was just a crush)
Sparks fly when we touch, it was never enough
It was just a crush (It was just a crush)
Yeah

[Bridge]
You'll be fine, just find another girl to kick around
Won't be long until they all know what I figured out

[Pre-Chorus]
Now look at me
The memories turn to dust
There is only one explanation

[Spoken Interlude]
I wasn't really in love (I wasn't really in love)
It was just a crush (It was just a crush)

[Chorus]
Sparks fly when we touch, it was never enough
It was just a crush (It was just a crush)
Yeah

[Outro]
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Yeah




[Verse 1]
Pull up to the mirror, staring at my face
Gotta chop-chop all the extra weight
I've been carrying for fourteen-hundred-sixty days
Gotta, gotta, gotta clean my slate

[Pre-Chorus]
And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Professionally messin' with my trust
How could I confuse that shit for love?

[Chorus]
So I gotta get
You out my head now
I just cut you off
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without you
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You out my head now
I just cut you off

[Verse 2]
I imagine all the endless places I could know
If I drop-drop and I let you go
All the possibilities I got from head to toe
Yeah, they'd, yeah, they'd, yeah, they'd start to show

[Pre-Chorus]
And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough (Had enough)
Emotionally messin' with my health, ha
How could I confuse that shit for love?

[Chorus]
So I gotta get
You out my head now
I just cut you off
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without you
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You out my head now

All the trauma's in remission
No, I don't need permission

[Chorus]
Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again

I'm high off the weight off of my shoulders
Mmm, ah

All the trauma's in remission
No, I don't need permission
I kickstart my system
When I speak, my body listens
I know what I'm missing

[Chorus]
Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
With my emotions undressed, I'm going in with everything
To dance again

[Intro]
Disappear

[Verse 1]
I remember the first time
But it wasn't the last time
That you told me that you'd take me back
So I'm still wondering why
It was ever a question
I should have learned my lesson
I keep coming back like a heart attack
That's always breaking

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

[Chorus]
You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear (disappear)
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear (disappear)

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear


[Verse2]
I don't want to be lonely
But you were always the only
One who cast a spell and made it feel
Like all of this was real
Nothing but an illusion
But I'm not gonna lose you
So just do your trick and make it quick
Cause I'm pretending

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

[Chorus]
You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear (disappear)
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear (disappear)

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on my bed with just your t-shirt on (t-shirt on)
Turning up the volume to my favorite song (favorite song)
Boy, I can't lie, what we did last night
You know it's constantly replaying, staying on my mind (on my mind)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll show you what I like, boy-boy-boy
If you show me what you like, boy-boy-boy
I'll show you what I like, show you what I like, like
If you show me what you like, boy

[Chorus]
If I had a choice, if I had my way
Boy, you know we'd do it every single day (everyday, everyday)
If I had a wish and if I had my way
Boy, you know we'd do it (you know we'd do it) every single day
(Every single, single day)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I wish I didn't feel so hypnotized (hypnotized)
But when I look at you, baby, it's justified (justified)
So I take what I want, and give what I got
To hell with all the rules, they keep us civilized (civilized)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll show you what I like, boy-boy-boy
If you show me what you like, boy-boy-boy
I'll show you what I like, show you what I like, like
If you show me what you like, boy

[Chorus]
If I had a choice, if I had my way
Boy, you know we'd do it every single day (everyday, everyday)
If I had a wish and if I had my way
Boy, you know we'd do it (you know we'd do it) every single day
(Every single, single day)

[Bridge]
Nowhere I'd rather be than anywhere alone just you and me
I'll be your Tonto, you'll be my Clyde
We'll be together, forever we'll ride
I want you more and more
You're hotter today than the day before
No lie, no lie
No lie, no lie

[Chorus]
If I had a choice, if I had my way (if I had my way)
Boy, you know we'd do it every single day (everyday, everyday)
If I had a wish (if I had a wish) and if I had my way (if I had my way)
Boy, you know we'd do it every single day
(Every single, single day)

[Outro]
I'll show you what I like, boy-boy-boy (oh, I'll show you)
If you show me what you like, boy-boy-boy (oh, I'll show ya)
I'll show you what I like, show you what I like, like
If you show me what you like, boy




[Verse 1]
Well, you know everything's gonna to be a breeze
And the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease
(Yes please)

[Verse 2]
But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you've never read
With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed!
(That's what I said)

[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not... what it seems


[Intro]
Everything
Is not
What it seems

[Verse 1]
Well, you know everything's gonna be a breeze
That the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease
Yes, please
But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you never read
With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed
That's what I said

[Refrain]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

[Verse 2]
There's always a lotta people that you need to see
But you got a quick way to get from A to B
Just be careful of who's aware of your reality
You know what I mean!
There's a whole other world that you only know
When you can make yourself invisible from head to toe
But understand, it's not the status quo
Oh, careful what you show!


[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems

[Breakdown]
Oh, ohh-oh
Ohh-oh, oh
Oh, ohh-oh
Ohh-oh, oh

[Bridge]
Uh, oh!
Things are getting kind of tricky
But it doesn't mean much to a girl like me
'Cause I can do the things that you'll never believe
Even in your wildest dreams
Well, excuse me
I know it's strange, but true
In my opinion, from my point of view
But once in a blue moon, I don't know what to do
It's like a catch-22


[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems

[Outro]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not
What it seems

[Verse 1]

You move in circles, you don't need an invitation
You spend your money, you can't get no satisfaction
You play it right, so you can get the right reaction

The truth is blurry, but the lies are getting clearer
Your eyes are fixed
Your smile is so elastic
You gave me roses, but they're all just made of plastic

I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams...

I want you to feel me (I want you to feel me)

[Post-Chorus]
Do your days get a little bit longer? (Oh)
Nights get a little bit colder? (Oh)
Heartbeat a little bit louder?

Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)
Heartbeat a little bit louder? (Louder)
Hah-ah-ah-ah-oh

[Verse 1]
No one love you like I love ya
Never cheat, never lie
Never put no one above ya
I gave you space and time
Now you're telling me you miss it
And I'm still on your mind
We were one in a million
And love is hard to find

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?

[Chorus]
Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me

Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh (Do you feel me?)
Days get a little bit longer? (Feel me)
Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh


[Verse 2]
When you're running, who you run to?
Where do you go to hide?
When she ain't giving you enough to
Get you through the night
Won't be caught up in the middle
Of your highs and your lows
Baby, long as you're not with me
You'll always be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?

[Chorus]
Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me

[Post-Chorus]
Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh (Do you feel me?)
Days get a little bit longer? (Feel me)
Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh


[Bridge]
Do you feel me? (Feel me)
Feel me (Oh, feel me)
Feel me (Feel me)

[Chorus]
Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me

[Post-Chorus]
Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh (Do you feel me?)
Days get a little bit longer? (Feel me)
Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh

[Outro]
Every time your lips touch another
Oh
Every time you dance with somebody

Watch all the flowers dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes whisper your name
Feel all the wonder lifting your dreams, you can fly (Fly)

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
When you believe, you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart

A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night, you can fly (Fly)

[Verse 1]
I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so far away
So far away
Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said, you never said

[Chorus]
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

[Post-Chorus]
Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

[Verse 2]
I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would go away
Just go away

[Chorus]
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

[Christina]
I've been runnin' through the jungle
I've been runnin' with the wolves to get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you, to get to you

[Dani]
I was wonderin' 'bout your momma
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sold that car that gave her problems?
I 'm just curious 'bout her, honest

[Christina]
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, that night
Lost in a feeling along with the stars in the sky

[Amy]
So I'm wondering, can we still be friends?
Can we still be friends?
Doesn't have to end
And if it ends, can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?

[Katherine]
I'm holdin' on, I'm paper thin
This loves a game, you always win
And blindly I am followin'
Break down these walls and come on in

[Lauren]
You've been wonderin' why I've been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
I know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had somethin' so good, oh

[Christina]
I've been runnin' through the jungle
I've been runnin' with the wolves to get to you

[Lisa]
To get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Did too much to ease the anger all for you
Yeah, all for you

[Dani]
All to get to you
Oh, oh, oh, to get to you




[Verse 1]
This is just what the doctor ordered (Yeah)
Put a gold star on my disorder
Yeah, we've talked around every corner
If I'm lookin' at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry
I'm a sensitive situation (Mmm)
You're a hot and cold combination
Oh, we both know we got complications (Mmm)
If I'm lookin' at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I try not to bother, not to bother you (Ah)
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too (Ah)

[Chorus]
Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got somethin' in this room
Can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh
But you look like fun
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, fun)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Can we keep it on a first name basis? (Ah)
We could overcrowd each other's spaces
You get me higher than my medication
Take me to different places, let's face it, I'm gettin' impatient (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I try not to bother, not to bother you (Ah)
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too (Ah)

[Chorus]
Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got somethin' in this room
Can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh
But you look like fun (Mmm, ow)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
You look like
You don't, but you know how
Like a beautiful breakdown
And it's just not right, but you look like
You don't, but you know how
Make me wanna slow down
And it's just not right that you look like

[Outro]
Fun (Yeah, ow)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, fun)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun




[Verse 1]
Turned my back to the door
Feel so much better now
Don't even try anymore
Nothing left to lose
There's a voice that's in the air
Saying don't look back nowhere
There's a voice that's always there

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I'll never be quite the same as I was before
This part of you still remains
Though it's out of focus
You're just somewhere that I've been
And I won't go back again
You're just somewhere that I've been

[Chorus 1]
I'm breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Living life crazy loud, like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth, nothing left to figure out
But I don't think I'll ever break through, the ghost of you

[Verse 2]
And I'll never be like I was the day I met you
Too naive, yes I was
Boy, that's why I let you in
Wear your memory like a stain
Can't erase or numb the pain
Here to stay with me forever

[Chorus 1]
I'm breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Living life crazy loud, like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth, nothing left to figure out
But I don't think I'll ever break through, the ghost of you

[Bridge]
One of these days, I'll wake up from this bad dream I'm dreaming
One of these days, I'll pray that I'll be over, over, over you
One of these days, I'll realize that I'm so tired of feeling confused
But for now, there's a reason that you're still here in my heart

[Chorus 2]
I'm breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Living life crazy loud, like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth, nothing left for me to doubt
But I don't think I'll ever break through, the ghost of you

[Outro]
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in, breathing out
Like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth, nothing left to figure out
But I don't think I'll ever break through, the ghost of you


[Intro]
What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants


[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down


[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Outro]
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby

[Chorus]
Shine the rest of the stars are watching
You're awesome, you're unique for all time
Wind your body from the bottom
To your crown you're a queen, you're divine
That's my goals
Goals, goals, goals
Goals, goals, goals

[Verse 1]
Don't be bitter
Hunnie here we are
In the mirror
Yes you just hung up (Just hung up)
Insecurity is doing its job
You are special
Baby you're a one off

[Pre-Chorus]
Time to start loving you
Shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you

[Chorus]
Shine the rest of the stars are watching
You're awesome, you're unique for all time
Wind your body from the bottom
To your crown you're a queen, you're divine
That's my goals
Goals, goals, goals
Goals, goals, goals


[Verse 2]
It's temporary
That's just how it goes (How it goes)
What I hated, now I love the most (I love the most)
Mother told me don't let nothing stop me (Stop)
Cause ain't no copies
Baby you're a one-off

[Pre-Chorus]
Time to start loving you
Shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you

[Chorus]
Shine the rest of the stars are watching
You're awesome, you're unique for all time
Wind your body from the bottom
To your crown you're a queen, you're divine

[Bridge]
Yes, you got a right to complain it's true
But look what you're gaining move
This message is saving you
You are in his graces too
The world's entertaining you
Cause they see the day in you
Forget who was playing you
Cause they die in their game too


[Chorus]
Shine the rest of the stars are watching
You're awesome, you're unique for all time (Time, time, time)
Wind your body from the bottom (From the bottom)
To your crown you're a queen, you're divine (You're a queen, you're divine)
That's my goals
Goals, goals, goals
Goals, goals, goals

I ain't tryna tell you how to dream, love
But I think that you could do better
Who let a little bit of doubt slip in
Slip it off, leave that slip on the floor
The slope slippery but let me slide this once, please

I came to you in my best, been tailoring my birthday suit
Been waiting for the first day you say yes
I play this game the best and came just to make breath an extension of blessings
No more and no less and the sex is impressive, OK
But the play is before and the mess on the floor is the best
I adore the way you seem unsure when the world's so obviously yours


I just wanna be good for you, everything I said I wouldn't do I would for you
Shining up and polishing this wood for you
Waiting in the hood for you, wonder would you help a brother out, I'm going out of my mind
Time is a factor I'm a disaster waiting to happen a minor infraction away, from a life sentence
Got my sentences running on and my senses is tripping
Come with me if you feel it
I promise it'll be so good

[Outro: Leslie Odom Jr.]
So good, so good, so good
Yeah, baby then I'll make it good for you
I know how to make it good for you
Baby can I be good to you
Proud I am
Make you understand
So good, so good, so good
Baby so good
Dress a mess on the floor
Proud I am to be yours
Baby, then I'll make it good for you
I'll make it good for you

Uh-huh, uh-huh...

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky]
Hold on, take a minute, love
I ain't trying to mess your business up





[Verse 1]
Easy come easy go for a minute
I can't keep my hands off you
You're a million dollar bill, don't forget it
I wanna spend my time on you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I been wondering
From morning to night
Stuck in delirum
I'm losing my mind
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it?
Feels so real, real, real

[Chorus]
You're my great escape
Feels to good to give away
And with every breath I take
I can't help myself, I can't help myself
You're my great escape
I won't let you get away
And with every breath I take
I can't help myself, I can't help myself

[Post Chorus]
Ohhh ohh

[Verse 2]
Wide awake wanna stay tunnel vision
Falling for the sweetest sin
I wanna taste everything when we're kissing
I love it when we're skin to skin

[Pre-Chorus]
And I been wondering
From morning to night
Stuck in delirium
I'm losing my mind
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it?
Feels so real, real, real

[Chorus]
You're my great escape
Feels to good to give away
And with every breath I take
I can't help myself, I can't help myself
You're my great escape
I won't let you get away
And with every breath I take
I can't help myself, I can't help myself

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
I'll be running, I'll be running, I'll be running
I'll be running, I'll be running, I'll be running

[Chorus]
You're my great escape
Feels to good to give away
And with every breath I take
I can't help myself, I can't help myself
You're my great escape (you're my great escape)
I won't let you get away
And with every breath I take
I can't help myself, I can't help myself

[Post Chorus]
Ooh, ooh

[Outro]
I'll be running, I'll be running, I'll be running
I'll be running, I'll be running, I'll be running

Can hold a gun
And hold your heart
Can put out fires
And make 'em start
Skin and bones
And flesh and blood
With all this nerve
How did we get this numb

Or they can change it too

To want a little change

If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
Ooooh

Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice

So come on give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

[Intro: Selena Gomez]
(Yeah, here, you're here, you're here
Higher, higher, higher, higher)

[Verse: Selena Gomez & Halsey]
Heaven in the valley, in the valley
Baby, it's higher, we did a
Hundred going into the night
And every day, you make a
Promise It'll be better in time
Can you tell me?
How long, how long do I gotta
Wait on, wait on?
'Cause my time, my time is running out

[Outro: Selena Gomez & Halsey]
I've been... in my body, in my body
Baby, it's higher, we did a
Hundred going into the night
And every day, you make a
Promise It'll be better in time
Can you tell me?
How long, how long do I gotta
Wait on, wait on?
'Cause my time, my time is running out




[Verse 1]
It's the boy you never told "I like you"
It's the girl you let get away
It's the one you saw that day on the train
But you freaked out and walked away
It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas
Things you swear you'll do before you die
It's the city of love that waits for you
But you're too damn scared to fly

[Chorus]
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
Come alive
Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
Come alive
Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight

[Verse 2]
It's the time that you totally screwed up
Still, you're tryna get it out your brain
It's the fight you had when you didn't make up
It's the past that you're dying to change
It's all the money that you're savin'
While the good life passes by
It's all the dreams that never came true
'Cause you're too damn scared to try

[Chorus]
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
Come alive
Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
Come alive
Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight

[Refrain]
It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world when you go all the way
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight

[Bridge]
So let's go, go, go, go all the way
Yeah, let's go, go, go, go night and day
From the floor to the rafters
People, raise your glasses
We could dance forever

[Chorus]
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight (Lose yourself tonight)
Come alive
Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight

[Refrain]
It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world when you go all the way
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight


[Verse 1]
Take it to the end
It will better you very soon, oh, yeah
Rely on your friends
They'll get you through
They're there for you, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Hold on
And suddenly you'll find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away

[Verse 2]
Don't let it get you down
It will bury you, very soon, oh, yeah
Come into your own
And then let it go
Don't you know, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Hold on
And suddenly you'll find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away


[Bridge]
When you've had enough of everything
All is left is let it go

[Chorus]
Hold on
And suddenly you find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away

Hold on
And suddenly you find your way
Hold on
Till yesterday is far away



[Verse 1]


[Chorus]
We're goin' half time
So many people sleep alone
We give 'em hope for love
So many long nights
Stayin' in with cigarettes and wine
We give 'em hope for love

[Verse 1]
Lo-fi, low lights, we don't need that club life
Half time, red wine, gold in the air

[Pre-Chorus]
Hair down, low rides, ooh, you like that baseline
Hands-free, you and me, come over here
Ooh, I-I, love revolution, don't u know
Ooh, I-I, they see us in the afterglow
Ooh, I-I, could save the world with what we know
We're giving them- we're giving them hope for love

[Chorus]
We're goin' half time
So many people sleep alone
We give 'em hope for love
So many long nights
Stayin' in with cigarettes and wine

I wanna shut the blinds, turn off the lights
Don't wanna go out on this Friday night
We're goin' half time
So many people sleep alone
We give 'em hope for love

[Verse 2]
Blue Jack, relax, we don't need that feedback
Hit that, lay back, floatin' on air

[Pre-Chorus]
Hair down, low rides, ooh, you like that baseline
Hands-free, you and me, come over here
Ooh, I-I, love revolution, don't u know

I wanna shut the blinds, turn off the lights
Don't wanna go out on this Friday night
We're goin' half time

[Refrain]
There's hope for love, hope for love, hope for love, hope for love
There's hope for love, hope for love, hope for love
There's hope for love, hope for love, hope for love, hope for love
There's hope for love, hope for love, hope for love

[Bridge]
We could keep this up all night, all night
We could keep this up all night, all night
We could keep this up all night, all night
We could keep this up all night, all night
(There's hope for love, hope for love, hope for love)

[Outro]
We give 'em hope for love



I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

[Pre-Chorus]
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Hook]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Hook]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
[I see me running through that open door

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly


Hey, cause I believe in me, oh

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Bridge]
Fly (i-i) Fly (i-i) Fly , Fly
I believe

[Hook]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
[I see me running through that open door

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, if I just spread my wings
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly, hey
If I just spread my wings
I can fly
Fly-eye-eye


[Intro: Selena Gomez]
Crazy
I like that, you like that, so let's be crazy
The contact, impact, I want that daily
Our breath getting deeper, deeper, lately
I like that, baby

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
'Cause I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough of your love
Give me some more, I love it
I can't get enough, yeah
'Cause I can't get enough

[Verse 1]
It doesn't hurt when I think of you
And all the things we'll never get to do
I don't dream at night about the way we were
I tore out the pictures, crossed out all the words

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't be fooled by all my tears, because everything is fine
And you can pick up all the pieces that you left behind

[Chorus]
'Cause I never think about you
I'm better off without you
I don't miss you at all
I don't miss you at all
You don't spin around in my head
It's like you never existed
And I hope you don't call
I don't miss you at all

[Post-Chorus]
And I'm not tryna fight it
No, I'm not tryna fight it
So you can cross my name right off the wall
I don't miss you at all

[Verse 2]
I go out seven nights a week
It feels so good to finally be free
And I party like I never did before
Oh, what in the world was I waiting for?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Everything is perfect now without you in my life
You can pick up all the pieces that you left behind

[Chorus]
'Cause I never think about you
I'm better off without you
I don't miss you at all
I don't miss you at all
You don't spin around in my head
It's like you never existed
And I hope you don't call
I don't miss you at all

[Post-Chorus]
And I'm not tryna fight it
No, I'm not tryna fight it
So you can cross my name right off the wall
I don't miss you at all
I don't miss you at all

[Bridge]
I'll just tell myself
Girl forget the past
No time for regrets
No more looking back
I'll forget you more
Every single day
Every step I take
Is getting better

[Chorus]
'Cause I never think about you
I'm better off without you
I don't miss you at all
I don't miss you at all
You don't spin around in my head
It's like you never existed
And I hope you don't call
I don't miss you at all

[Post-Chorus]
And I'm not tryna fight it
No, I'm not tryna fight it
So you can cross my name right off the wall
I don't miss you at all

[Outro]
I don't miss you
I don't miss you




[Verse 1]
I picked you out in a crowd of a thousand faces
Yeah, I found you, ooh
I chose the why's and the when's, all the random places
Yeah, I chose you, ooh
I let you see me
Let you believe it was your move
So smooth
My rules

[Chorus]
Well, you think you are the one who got me, boy
But I got you
I've been playing with you like a little toy
Yeah, I got you
I got you

[Verse 2]
You'd be surprised of all the times I almost told you
But I stayed cool, ooh
I almost broke, but I knew I would get to hold you
'Cause I'm no fool, ooh
You came up to me
And did the very thing I knew
That you do, ooh

[Chorus]
Well, you think you are the one who got me, boy
But I got you
I've been playing with you like a little toy
Yeah, I got you
I got you

[Bridge]
You gave me all control, I got you
I took your heart and soul, I got you
For me, I'm going to roll
I got you, you, you

[Breakdown 1]
I got you, ooh yeah
I got you and I love it
I got you
Yeah, I got you

[Outro]

I got you
Yeah, I got you


[Verse 1]
You're so hot, not
But if I can be honest, baby, you're all that I've got
You're so cool, not
But if you didn't notice, you got me playing the fool, with you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why I'm all about you
If it's real, tell me so, 'cause I'm not letting you go

[Chorus]
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
We will never change our minds, but I want you to stay
Up all night, cross the line
'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way

[Verse 2]
You're so you, ew gross
But there's something about you that's making me feel like I do, with you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why I'm all about you
If it's real, tell me so, 'cause I'm not letting you go


[Chorus]
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
We will never change our minds, but I want you to stay

'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way

[Bridge]
Not my type
This can't be, can't be true
We will, I'm all about
If it's real, tell me so, 'cause I'm not letting you go

[Chorus]
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
We will never change our minds, but I want you to stay

'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez & Eric Bellinger]
I feel like I'm walking in the sky (Whoa, whoa)
Yesterday tears were in my eyes (Whoa, whoa)
What's a bad day?
Yeah, I've been there before
But I keep my head up so I don't have those anymore
I made a choice to be the best that I could ever be
Gotta stay positive, ignore the negativity

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I'm gonna follow my intuition
Telling myself to listen
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good day
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It's gonna be a good day
Follow my intuition
It's gonna be a good day

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez & Eric Bellinger]
I gotta go with what feels right (Whoa, whoa)
Don't always need a reason why (Whoa, whoa)
What's the problem, compared to the weight of the world?
Quit trying to please every man, woman, boy and girl
Better pick up the pace, there ain't no time to waste
Tomorrow's never promised, so I started living for today

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I'm gonna follow my intuition
Telling myself to listen
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good day
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It's gonna be a good day
Follow my intuition
It's gonna be a good day

[Bridge: Selena Gomez & Eric Bellinger]
All I know is that I just gotta let go
Yeah, looking back, it's always easy to know
Sometimes, it just gets so confusing
Feel like I don't know what I'm doing
But I trust my heart
And in the end, it turns out to be better than when it began
You see, what's meant to be is gonna happen
You know it's gonna be a good day

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I'm gonna follow my intuition
Telling myself to listen
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good day
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It's gonna be a good day
Follow my intuition
It's gonna be a good day

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
It's gonna be a good day
Follow my intuition


[Verse 1]
I know that my love for you is real
It's something true that we do
Just something natural that I feel
When you walk in the room, when you're near
I feel my heart skip a beat, the whole world disappears

[Pre-Chours 1]
And there's just you and me
Falling head over feet
Let's take a chance together

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know, we gonna make it
'Cause no one else can make me feel the way that you do
I promise you
I know, I know, I know, I know, we gonna get there
Today, tomorrow, and forever we will stay true
I promise you

[Verse 2]
They say that we're just too young to know
But I'm sure, heart and soul, that I am never letting you go
When it's right, it's right, and this is it
'Cause I'm walking on air every single time that we kiss


[Pre-Chorus 2]
You make the angels sing
You give that songbird wings
You make everything better

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know, we gonna make it
'Cause no one else can make me feel the way that you do
I promise you
I know, I know, I know, I know, we gonna get there
Today, tomorrow, and forever we will stay true
I promise you

[Bridge]
I'll never let you down
I'll always hear you out
There is nothing you cannot confide
You listen when I speak
You make my knees go weak
And I just want you by my side

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know, we gonna make it (Make it)
'Cause no one else can make me feel the way that you do
I promise you
I know, I know, I know, I know, we gonna get there
Today, tomorrow, and forever we will stay true
I promise you


[Outro]
We gonna make it
I promise you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I promise you
I promise you
I promise you



[Intro: Selena Gomez]
I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery
And I was high enough

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
No, I don't wanna know
Where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?

[Drop: Selena Gomez & Kygo]
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and The Libertines
Never growing up

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I'll take with me
The polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you

I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
I'm slipping down a chain reaction
And here I go, here I go, here I go, go
And once again, I'm yours in fractions
It takes me down, pulls me down, pulls me down low

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Honey, it's raining tonight
But storms always have an eye, have an eye
Tell me your cover tonight
Or tell me lies, tell me lies, lies, lies

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me, we're the same force
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

You and me run the same course
You and me run the same course


[Verse 1]
You had me to get her
And here, I thought it was me
I was changing
Arranging my life to fit your lies
It's all said and all done
I gave it all for the long run
Can she say the same thing?
I guess this is goodbye and good luck
(I can't be what you want me to be)

[Chorus 1]
I'm sorry for changing
I'm sorry it had to be this way
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend
But I won't apologize for who I am
No, no

[Verse 2]
Remember the time when
You said you were out with your best friend?
But it wasn't the best friend
That you know I thought you meant and
I used to accept it
I didn't know I could be free
But I am, and I won't
Go back 'cause you so don't deserve me
(I don't even wanna be her)


[Chorus 1]
I'm sorry for changing
I'm sorry it had to be this way
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend
But I won't apologize for who I am

[Bridge]
I thank you for this hopeless war
'Cause through the pain, I found I'm stronger than before
Now I'm more
I don't need you anymore
I'm sorry
(Listen close, I won't say this again)

[Chorus 1]
I'm sorry for changing
I'm sorry it had to be this way
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend
But I won't apologize for who I am

[Chorus 2]
I'm sorry for changing
I'm sorry, it isn't like it was
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend
But I won't apologize for who I am


[Outro]
Why should I apologize?
No, I won't apologize for who I am

[Verse 1]
The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
We don't have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

We're running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You're willing to fight, to be right

[Pre-Chorus]
Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you're fighting

Hey, you started out sweeter than hard candy
Words were like licorice to the taste
But slowly, all the sugar, it went to waste
Went to waste
Oh, you started getting funny with no jokes
I started seein' through you like a ghost
And now I'm pretty sure I can't take no more
I can't take no more-ore

[Chorus]
I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're actin' super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
You've been lyin' just for fun
Luckily, no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

[Verse 1]
When you walk, you don't leave tracks
When you talk, they don't talk back
Believe in every word you say
But they don't know
They don't, don't know
Secrets that you just can't keep
Promises that you made me
You twisted it to suit yourself, but now I know
I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, everything that I told you
Ooh, you just smile, and then you

[Chorus]
Kiss and tell everything I said
Stuck inside your little web
Everybody wants to know, yeah
Lips that lie, caught in your trap
Sold me out, and you just laugh
Say we're friends until the end, yeah
But you don't mean it, don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no


[Verse 2]
I wish that I could take it back
You want it all, but you can't have that
People falling at your feet
But they don't know
They don't, don't know
You're gonna figure out real soon
The dirty deeds will catch up to you
It's crumbling beneath your feet
But you don't know
You don't, don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, everything that I told you
Ooh, you just smile, and then you

[Chorus]
Kiss and tell everything I said
Stuck inside your little web
Everybody wants to know, yeah
Lips that lie, caught in your trap
Sold me out, and you just laugh
Say we're friends until the end, yeah
But you don't mean it, don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no

Sold me out, and you just laugh
Say we're friends until the end, yeah

[Verse 1]
Like a prayer surroundin' us, movin' effortlessly
Every word is relief
I'm in dance floor therapy, all my babies and me
But tonight, it's for free
No self-sabotage, no letting my thoughts run
Me and this spiral are done
Burn this camouflage I've been wearing for months
Tryna let a little happy in for once

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (Ooh)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (Ooh)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out

[Verse 2]
Diving in ferociously, dancing intimately
I'm so connected to me
In the dark, I'm letting go, so anonymously
I guess this is what it feels like to be free

I need to let my mind rest (My, my mind)
While my body reflects (Ooh)

Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (Ooh)
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (Ooh)
I'm good right now (Get up), I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-

[Bridge]
Oh my, I guess this is what it feels like to be free (Ooh)
Oh my, I guess this is what it feels like to see me (Ooh, down, ooh)

(Get down) Don't get me (Ooh)
(Get down) Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out

[Chorus]
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (Ooh, I won't let me get me)
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (Ooh)

Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you

You know is very simple
I'm standing right here
Let me love you
You know is very simple

[Verse 1]
If time came to an end today
And we left too many things to say
If we could turn it back, what would we want to change?
Now's the time to take a chance
Come on, we gotta make a stand
What have we got to lose?
The choice is in our hands

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can find a way to do anything
If we try to

[Chorus]
Live like there's no tomorrow ('Cause all we have is here right now)
Love like it's all that we know (The only chance we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside
Believe, and it will never die
Don't ever let this life pass us by
Live like there's no tomorrow

[Verse 2]
If there never was a night or day
And memories could fade away
Then there'd be nothing left
But the dreams we made
Take a leap of faith and hope you'll fly
Feel what it's like to be alive
Give it all that we've got
And lay it all on the line


[Pre-Chorus]
And we can find a way to do anything
If we try to

Live like there's no tomorrow

Be here by my side
We'll do this together
Just you and me
Nothing is impossible
Nothing is impossible

Live like there's no tomorrow ('Cause all we have is here right now)
Love like it's all that we know (The only chance we ever found)

Live like there's no tomorrow

[Verse 1]
They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down

[Pre-Chorus]
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment

Made her more of a woman (Made her more of a woman)

[Verse 1]
In the dark, we can see
Feel your hand touching me
Run away from a world outside we know
In your lips, I confide
In our love we can hide
Run away from a world outside we know

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I'm waking next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
Used to be
I'm never giving up on this

[Chorus]
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

[Verse 2]
'Cause we fit perfectly
When you lay over me
Run away from a world outside we know

Used to be

And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you
The lover in me is the lover in you

Break down the walls, let heaven in
Somewhere in forever, we'll dance again
We used to be inseparable
I used to think that I was irreplaceable
We lit the whole world up before we blew it up
I still don't know just how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

[Chorus]
Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember

Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember

[Bridge: Selena Gomez]
Break down the walls, let heaven in
Somewhere in forever, we'll dance again
We used to be inseparable
I used to think that I was irreplaceable
We lit the whole world up before we blew it up
I still don't know just how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember




[Verse 1]
It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on
With the best of 'em
You are beautiful
Like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again
And I want you to know, baby

[Chorus]
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

[Verse 2]
Constantly
Boy, you play through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me
What you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free
I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are
And I want you to know, baby

[Chorus]
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby

And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

[Bridge]

You stand alone to every record I own
Music to my heart, that's what you are
A song that goes on and on

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

[Verse 1]
I've never been awake
I've never seen a daybreak
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
A lazy day in bed
Music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

[Verse 2]
I love a sunny day
I dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
I've never been awake
I've never seen a daybreak
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so


[Verse 1]
Just drive, I'm sick of talking
We know where this is going
I'm done, take me home
I can't wait forever
For you to get yourself together
I'd rather be alone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm so tired of pretending
Just want a happy ending

[Chorus]
Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet?
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

[Verse 2]
You taught me what I know
Guys like you come and go
But I know things can change


[Pre-Chorus 2]
See, my heart, it may be broken
But that won't stop me hoping

[Chorus]
Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet?
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
Make it all come true

[Bridge]
I just want to know what we should have done
Want to figure out what we could have become
Because I know in my heart I'm not over you
I just want to go back and try it again
Turn back the time, this isn't the end of us
It isn't the end of us, it isn't the end of us

[Chorus]
(Whoa) Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? (Oh)
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true


[Chorus]
Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet?
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

[Intro]
1 2 3!
Uh, uh
Ye-ow!
(Ice Ice)
[Laugh]

[Verse 1]
You won't know anything unless you try
Might end up falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

[Chorus]
Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Going to give it all we got
Yeah we aren't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're going to
Make it happen

[Verse 2]
I won't be whining about
What mightn't been
You know I'm not too big on giving in
I use whatever spell the law allows
That is of course, if I knew how


[Chorus]
Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Going to give it all we got
Yeah we aren't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're going to
Make it happen

[Verse 3]
You won't know anything unless you try
Might end up falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

[Chorus]
Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Going to give it all we got
Yeah we aren't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're going to
Make it happen


[Verse 4]
We're not afraid to fall
Yeah we're going for it all
There's no nothing to our madness
Yeah we're answering the call
If we used a little magic
Well we really can't recall
All I Know is that we're going to
Make it happen
Ye-ow!





[Verse 1]
Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand
I don't need a man

[Chorus]
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

[Verse 2]
The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand
I don't need a man

[Chorus]
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

[Bridge]
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

[Chorus / Outro]
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
No jodas nosotras
Me and my girls

[Verse 1]
Ooh, the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh, the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes

[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

[Chorus]
Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between

Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no

Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm


[Verse 2]
Ooh, I start to feel it now
Feeling like I'm truly free
I'm free in me
Ooh, the heat's a common ground
No matter what's your history
Be free with me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some

[Verse 1]
You left me spinning like a disco
Trying, but I don't know if I can stand straight
You took me left when you knew I was right
And now I gotta fight just to make it through the day

[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew what you were capable of
Baby, I would've kept my heart
But I gave it up, baby, I fell in love
Now I don't know where to start

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost, trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this alone
But now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

[Verse 2]
You left me broken like a record, baby
I'm, baby, I'm hurt and I don't wanna play anymore
Missed every sign, believed every lie
Whoa, whoa
And I was waiting for more


[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew what you were capable of
Baby, I would've kept my heart
But I gave it up, baby, I fell in love
Now I don't know where to start

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost, trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this alone
But now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

[Bridge]
You took my heart off my sleeve
But now I'm taking it back, back
Baby, here I come
You took advantage of me
I don't appreciate that, that
You son of a gun

[Breakdown]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere


[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost, trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this alone
But now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

Whenever you're around
Trouble calls my name
But I don't mind
As long as we conclude the day my way


[Intro]
Mustard on that beat

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Look in the mirror
Who do I see? Who do I wanna be today?
If you came for a show, which role should I take?
Fading to gray, so do we make a big mistake?
True colors'll show, baby, just put me on display

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I know it's hard to understand
Chains around me are suffocating me (suffocating me)
The stress we feel it's hard to express
I have no secrets
'Cause there's a version of me that I don't know how to hide
When you're making me glow with your fingers against my thighs
(Glow)


[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Selena Gomez]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears]
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
This mood ring, mmm
This mood swing is unhanded , mmm

[Bridge: Britney Spears & Selena Gomez]
I'm in the palm of your hand
My temperature is at your command
By my demand
And now I'm falling for you
I turn to golden from blue
And you do too, ah

[Refrain: Selena Gomez & Britney Spears]
Every second i wanna call you
But I don't, i'm sure that i can hate you
I'm sure i can hate you

I think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Selena Gomez]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

[Intro]
I want more
I want more

[Verse 1]
Friday night and we're just talking
Stars are crashing in the sky
Burning just for you and I
We don't need to overthink this
Nothing's gonna bring us down
Show them what we're all about

[Pre-Chorus]
All the way, 101 percent, touchdown
We gonna kill it, lead the pack
Gon' take this town

[Chorus]
Let's go, whatcha wanna wait for?
Let's take everything we asked for
C'mon and turn it up
Let's tell them what we want more, more, more
Let's go take over the dance floor
You'll be mine and I will be yours
C'mon and let it play
And let me hear you say more, more, more

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and pull me closer
Whisper nothing's in my ear
'Til the walls just disappear
Feel the music take you higher
Feel my heart beat like a drum
Baby, you're the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
All the way, 101 percent, touchdown
We gonna kill it, lead the pack
Gon' take this town

[Chorus]
Let's go, whatcha wanna wait for?
Let's take everything we asked for

You'll be mine and I will be yours
C'mon and let it play
And let me hear you say more, more, more

[Bridge]
C'mon everybody, let's go party 'til they kick us out now
I don't care
Once we get it started, we won't stop until we get it all out
Take me there
Take me there

[Chorus]
Let's go, whatcha wanna wait for?
Let's take everything we asked for
C'mon and turn it up

And let me hear you say more, more, more

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
All I need is love
That's what you give
I'm taking it tonight
All I need is touch
That's what I feel when your skin's on mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together 24/7
And all of the colors brighter
'Cause you set me up on fire

[Chorus]
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you

[Verse 2]
All I need is true
That's what you are when everything's a lie
All I need is here, right where you are
You're every reason why

[Pre-Chorus]
And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together 24/7
And all of the colors brighter
'Cause you set me up on fire

[Chorus]
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together
And all of the colors brighter
'Cause you set me up on fire
'Cause you set me up on fire
'Cause you set me up on fire

[Chorus]
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you


[Verse 1]
You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind
The conversation goes nowhere
'Cause you're never gonna take me there

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah, I know what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

[Chorus]
Here's my dilemma:
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine
I heard the rumors, but you won't come clean
I guess I'm hoping it's because of me


[Pre-Chorus]
And I know what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah, I know what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

[Chorus]
Here's my dilemma:
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you

[Bridge]
Oh, I could live without you
Your smile, your eyes, the way you make me feel inside
I could live without you
But I don't wanna, I don't wanna, oh
Oh, you make me so upset sometimes
(Here's my dilemma, oh oh)

[Chorus]
Here's my dilemma:
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head (Can't get you outta my)
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you


[Outro]
(It's you, it's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you (It's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you
My-my-my dilemma

My world
You tried to change it all but i said hey, let's take it slow
There was something kept us to not make it together
We ended it all, you changed with another just for show
How do you want me to believe that you were lover?
I called you mine and there was nothing mine at all
'cause you owned yourself just to owe to other girl
Spoke the words i wanted to hear to watch me fall
Baby, we should've ruled but you ruined my world
You cried to me like i was the one which crucified
Said you have changed baby, have you changed?
But you looked me in the eye even though you lied
I fell to my knees, without knowing that you revenged
I called you mine and there was nothing mine at all
'cause you owned yourself just to owe to other girl
Spoke the words i wanted to hear to watch me fall
Baby, we should've ruled but you ruined my world
So many years spent but you replaced like it's wasted
Big love, big crush and it ended in the way i couldn't take
I start to wonder that if she tastes the way i tasted
Darling, i still got the same tiny heart that you still break
I called you mine and there was nothing mine at all
'cause you owned yourself just to owe to other girl
Spoke the words i wanted to hear to watch me fall
Baby, we should've ruled but you ruined my world
So many years spent but you replaced like it's wasted
Big love, big crush and it ended with your one word
I start to wonder that if you still taste like you'd tasted
Baby, we should've ruled it but you ruined my world

Somebody hears your opinion
Somebody cares what you say

Trying everything just to touch your dreams

You look so classic, fantastic
Oh when you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that

It's become so hard
For me to be surprised
You're bringing back the real me
No judgment in your eyes


Cause when I dance with you
It's how I speak the truth
Just classic when we met
Now you make me new

You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat

You look so classic, fantastic
When you on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
(Bring the beat back once more)

You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat

You look so classic, fantastic
When you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Bring it back, bring it back
Let me see you do that


You're the new classic

Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that

[Verse 1]
No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch
Can get me there, nowhere enough
To love me like you do, to love me like you do
No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush
Can you keep me high, I swear no one
Can love me like you do, can love me like you do, no

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever led me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody ooh

[Verse 2]
No oxygen, can barely breathe
My darkest sin, you've raised release
And it's all because of you, all because of you
I don't know what it is, but you've pulled me in
No one compares, could ever begin
To love me like you do
And I wouldn't want them to
Cause...


[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

[Bridge]
I don't want nothing else
Not when I had the best
I don't want nothing else
Because you showed me the best


[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

[Verse 1]
You're my bad boy fairytale
Prince Charming, with a dark side
I wanna be your bad girl
You bring out my wild side

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Your eyes, your lips, your touch
This toxic, twisted rush
Your sexy kinda swag
The best I've ever had

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody does it like you
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody

[Verse 2]
You're my bad boy fairytale
My rebel with a halo
You hit me like a hurricane
And I can never say no

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your mind, your hands, your voice
The way you make me yours
Your sexy kinda swag
The best I've ever had

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody

[Outro]
I wanna be a bad girl
You bring out my wild side

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Twisted, you've shaken my existence
When I'm with you, baby, bliss is all I've come to know
(I want you, come to me)
Running, I didn't see it coming
Blinded, it's so stunning
I don't wanna let you go

[Chorus: Selena Gomez & (Tim James)]
A thousand church bells ringing
I can hear the angels singing when you call my name
Your love is off the chain (Off the chain, chain, off the chain)
The chemistry is crazy and you make me feel amazing
And I can't explain, your love is off the chain (Off the chain, chain, off the chain)

[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez & (Tim James)]
Your love (Is off the chain) your love (Is off the chain)
Your love (Is off the chain chain, off the chain)
Your love (Is off the chain) your love (Is off the chain)
Your love (Is off the chain chain, off the chain)

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
Coming, just keep the magic coming
You got me, baby, crushing
But it feels like so much more
Just when, when I least expect it
You make it feel so epic
Like nothing I've felt before


[Chorus: Selena Gomez & (Tim James)]
A thousand church bells ringing
I can hear the angels singing when you call my name
Your love is off the chain (Off the chain, chain, off the chain)
The chemistry is crazy and you make me feel amazing
And I can't explain, your love is off the chain (Off the chain, chain, off the chain)

[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez & (Tim James)]
Your love (Is off the chain) your love (Is off the chain)
Your love (Is off the chain chain, off the chain)
Your love (Is off the chain) your love (Is off the chain)
Your love (Is off the chain chain, off the chain)

[Bridge: Selena Gomez]
I'm not the type who gets crazy for someone
Odds of me tripping are like next to nothing
Guarded my heart like a diamond ring
But love, your love, changes everything

[Breakdown: Selena Gomez]
Everything is changed, everything is changed
Everything is changed, your love is off the chain
Oh, everything is changed, everything is changed
Now everything has changed, your... (Love is off)

[Chorus: Selena Gomez & (Tim James)]
A thousand church bells ringing
I can hear the angels singing when you call my name
Your love is off the chain (Off the chain, chain, off the chain)

Your love, your love, your love, love's (Off the chain)
Your love, your love, your love, love's (Off the chain)
(Off the chain, off the chain)

[Verse 1]
Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

[Chorus]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Only you, only you
Only you, only you


[Verse 3]
This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

[Chorus]
And all I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Only you

[Verse 1]
You've been riding this horse a long time
Why can't you find what you've been looking for?
Always greener on the other side
Always believing there must be something more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Never stay very long anywhere
As the next girl you leave gets smaller
In your rear-view mirror

[Chorus]
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
If you tear her world apart, you have no regrets
If there's a key to your heart, no one's found it yet
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

[Verse 2]
Your reputation's getting out of control
I can't believe she believes one word you said
Before I let you take my girlfriend home
I've got to warn her about the price on your head


[Pre-Chorus 2]
It must feel so alone out there
Always running away from someone
But you get nowhere

[Chorus]
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
If you tear her world apart, you have no regrets
If there's a key to your heart, no one's found it yet
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

[Bridge]
I'm from the Lone Star State
I'm ready to bring you in, oh
I'm going to seal your fate
Make you pay for all of your sins
Oh, oh oh
You've been riding this horse a long time
I've had my eye on you all night
I'm gonna find a way to make you mine
I know, even though


[Chorus]
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
If you tear her world apart, you have no regrets
If there's a key to your heart, no one's found it yet
You're an outlaw, you're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

[Outro]
Stop running

[Intro]
Hm, oh, oh
Hm, oh

[Verse 1]
Telling in the night
Miss you in the dark
Thought the opposite
But I was worth it
Wanted to say
I'm holding on
But I remember when
We were perfect
Perfect, perfect
I remember when
We were perfect

[Chorus]
I can't get you out
Out of my head
My head, my head
I can't get you out
Out of my head
My head, my head

[Verse 2]
It hurts to say goodbye
I'll see you in my dreams
I couldn't heal your scars
We tried to make believe
You say the perfect things
But do the opposite
I wonder if you even know you're talking shit
You wanna build a bridge now
But I'm over it
I took the boulder on your shoulder
Then I sculpted it
Lying in your bed
Instead of to my face
But some things you do
Can't be erased


[Chorus]
I can't get you out
Out of my head
My head, my head
I can't get you out
Out of my head
My head, my head



[Intro]
I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yeah
I know you're loco

[Verse 1]
They say you shouldn't sleep with
Someone crazier than you
Cr-Cr-Crazier than you
No one's crazier than you
But you're so irresistible
I had to break the rules
Your temper can be sexy
I love it when you hate me

[Chorus]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're loco
But feels too good, yo

[Verse 2]
They say you shouldn't sleep with
Someone crazier than you
Cr-Cr-Crazier than you
No one's crazier than you
But you're so unforgettable
I had to break the rules
Your eyes are like a weapon
They'd kill me if I let 'em

[Chorus]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're loco
But feels too good, yo

[Post-Chorus]
I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yo
Uh oh, I know you're...
Uh oh, I know you're loco
Uh oh, I know you're...

[Bridge]
I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you, ooh
I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you
I just can't get enough of you

[Chorus]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're loco
Uh oh I know you're loco
But feels too good, yo

[Outro]
But it feels too good, yeah
Uh oh, I know you're loco
Uh oh, I know you're...
Uh oh, I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yeah


[Verse 1: Trevor Daniel & Selena Gomez]
I'm trying to be honest with my happiness
Don't know why I'm bad at this, uh
And I don't wanna sit in all my sadness
I know it's a habit of mine

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez & Trevor Daniel]
Perfect, perfect timing
I start what I don't know how to end
Don't re-, don't remind me
I ruined it before it began, oh

[Chorus: Selena Gomez with Trevor Daniel]
Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you could never figure me out

Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you, only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last time, was the last time, woah

[Verse 1]
You were runnin' through me like water
Now the feeling's leavin' me dry
These days, we couldn't be farther
So how's it feel to be on the other side?

[Pre-Chorus]
So many wasted (Wasted)
Nights with (Nights with) you (You)
I still can taste it (Taste it)
I hate it, wish I could take it back 'cause

[Chorus]
We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't
We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't

When it was good, we were on fire
Now I'm breathin' ashes and dust
I always wanna get higher
I never know when enough is enough

Nights with (Nights with) you (You)

[Verse 1]
Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
And she's perfect

[Verse 2]
How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

[Bridge]
I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect




Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
'Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
And she's perfect

How does she touch you? can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind
With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

At the end of the sky where there's nothing to lose
Baby, worship me and I will praise you too

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, worship me and I will praise you too

Let me be the air you breathe
No one's gonna find us
We don't wanna let them see

You can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life
Like the air

You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where you're at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air

[Chorus]
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

[Verse 2]
The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on, when the night is done
Like the sun


[Chorus]
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

[Bridge]
So even when your bones feel like weights
And it's hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
It'll be alright, they're just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

[Chorus]
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

Rock Mafia
Rock Mafia

[Verse 1]
Preacher man walked into the club, and he said
He said, "Hey girl, can't you walk and not stray?"
Father, I'm torn and I'm selling my soul to the
Rhythm, the beat and the bass
'Cause I can't confess my rock and roll ways (Ooh)
'Cause I'm so possessed with the music
The music he plays

[Chorus]
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love with my rock, rock god

[Verse 2]
Preacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said, "Hey girl, can't you live your life right?"
Father, things aren't always so black and white
Don't cast the first stone 'cause I'm not alone
And it's not like I'm hurting anyone (Ooh)
But I can't confess my rock, my rock and roll ways

[Chorus]
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love with my rock, rock god
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love with my rock, rock god

[Bridge]
No, I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
'Cause I chose a path and I'm not looking back
And I'm sorry if I left the angels crying over me

[Chorus]
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love with my rock, rock god

[Outro]
Preacher man, preacher man
Preacher man, preacher man
(Forgive me, for I don't know what I do)
Preacher man, preacher man
(Preacher man, why don't you understand?)
Preacher man, preacher man
'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
(Have you ever felt this way?
Have you ever ever never, felt this way?)
Yeah, I'm gone, gone, gone with my rock, rock god

[Intro]
Round and round
Round and round
Round and round

[Verse 1]
You see me standing there and act like you don't know me
But last night, you were calling me, saying you want me
Oh, why you always make me feel like I'm the one that's crazy?
You got my heart racing
My, my heart racing

Going 'round and 'round and 'round


[Verse 2]
You come to pull me close and whisper in my ear
You always told me lies, I've cried out all my tears
I push my feelings to the side, but then you bring them back
Br-bring 'em back, now you got me singing

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I need you here with me

Going 'round and 'round and 'round

[Bridge]
Love me, or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop
Love me, or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop

'Round and 'round
Well, you're gonna miss me, 'cause I'm getting dizzy
Going 'round and 'round and 'round




We had our moments. We had our fights. We had the nights were I slept on the coach while you slept in the kitchen. But worst of all, you've cheated multiple times and I'm faded. Now you see me gone. Now you see how tired I was of you
So don't be, coming back to me. After seeing how I am. Cause I hope you know my response
No, don't be running back to me. I don't wanna be, your lover. No, I don't wanna see you anymore. I don't wanna play your games


[Verse 1]
Happier times flash through my mind
We both say it's over, and I believe it this time
All the pain that I hide
Let it play through the night

[Chorus]
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

[Verse 2]
I won't regret what I won't forget
Memories and your number are all I have left
I wish you the best, I really do
Even though I know that I'm still not over you
I know that we both are to blame
I can't believe, you didn't fight harder for me


[Chorus]
It's a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

[Bridge]
The more you love, the more it hurts
When it ends, when it's over
All that's left are the memories
Playing over, and over
In your head, in your heart
Turn it up, make it stop
Tonight, all over the world
The most beautiful song ever heard

[Chorus]
Is a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

[Breakdown]
Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes, eyes, eyes

[Chorus]
Baby, when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy, you keep my heartbeat skipping when you touch me
Even though the time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
Oh, when the night starts slipping away
Save the day

[Post-Chorus]
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, oh
Save the day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, oh
Save the day



Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes, your eyes
It's the end of the night
But the beginning of time, for you and I
I can't believe that my body is still moving
It makes me feel like we're doing something right


Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you got my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away


Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away
Save the day


De de de de de de day

Yeah we're still wide awake
Got me losing my mind, my mind
No, it's never too late
Put your lips on mine
In the burning sunlight, I
I can't believe that my body is still moving
It makes me feel like we're doing something right


Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you got my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away
Save the day

[Intro: Alan Watts, Selena Gomez]
And you go into, they are, relationships with each other
You realize it all hangs together
That everything outside the universe is a system of balances (I want a boyfriend)
Where you couldn't have really any form of life (I want a boyfriend)
Without the others going on too

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut again and again
I want a boyfriend
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love again and again (again and again)
Again and again

[Verse: Selena Gomez]
I been up all night
Pretty restlessly
Think I might know why (I want a boyfriend)
I've been doing just fine
Pretty restlessly
Think I might know why (I want a boyfriend)

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut again and again (Again and again)
I want a boyfriend
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love again and again (again and again)
Again and again (again and again)
Again and again (again and again)
Again and again (again and again)

[Outro: Alan Watts]
So they're constantly being pruned
By various kinds of enemy species
And what is, when you've got down there?
And you suppose you identified yourself with a certain plant
You would thoroughly object to, if you were a lettuce, to the snails eating you




[Selena Gomez:]
Take it or leave it
Baby take it or leave it
But I know you won't leave it
'Cause I know that you need it, ah
Look in the mirror
When I look in the mirror
Baby I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer, ah

I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

Reaching your limit
Say you're reaching your limit
Going over your limit
But I know you can't quit it, ah
Something about me
Got you hooked on my body
Take you over and under and twisted up like origami, ah

I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

[Gucci Mane:]
The way you walk, the way you talk
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
Ya playin' hard, don't turn me off
Ya acting hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded
Might as well go 'head and whip it
'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need and
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Order diamonds, Aquafina
Just need you in a blue bikini

[Selena Gomez:]
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love




[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus, Nick Jonas, Both]
A word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away
We've all got a gift
Yeah, something to give
To make a change

[Chorus 1: Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas]
Send it on (Send it on)
On and on (On and on)
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (Be a part)
Reach your heart (Reach your heart)
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong
Shine a light, and send it on

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato, Joe Jonas, Demi Lovato & Joe Jonas, Miley Cyrus, *Nick Jonas*, All]
Just smile (Just smile)
And the world (and the world)
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
That's meant for one will become two
If we take the chances
*To change circumstances*
Imagine all we can do, if we

[Chorus 2: Demi Lovato & Joe Jonas, Selena Gomez, All]
Send it on (Send it on)
On and on (On and on)
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (Be a part)
Reach your heart (Reach your heart)
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on (Oh, send it on)

[Interlude: Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas, Demi Lovato & Joe Jonas]
There's power in all of the choices we make
So I'm starting now, there's not a moment to waste

[Bridge: Selena Gomez, Selena Gomez & Kevin Jonas]
A word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away

Send it on (Send it on)
On and on (On and on)
Just one hand can heal another

Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action, the chain reaction will never stop
Make us strong (Shine a light)
Shine a light, and send it on

[Chorus 4: All, Demi Lovato, Joe Jonas]
Send it on (Send it on)
On and on (On and on)
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (Be a part)
Reach your heart (Reach your heart)
Just one spark starts the fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will help things start
Make us strong

[Intro]
Don't like waiting, don't like waiting
Let's go right now
Gotta hit the ground dancing 'fore the music slows down
What I'm saying, what I'm saying
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level, this is the remix

[Verse 1]
Everybody, everybody get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy when the kick hits the floor
Make a scene, make a scene nobody can ignore
Don't knock it 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more

[Chorus]
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

[Post-Chorus]
Shake it up

[Verse 2]
Break it down, break it down
I've got something to say
When you're dancing with me, it's like we go M.I.A
Make a scene, make a scene nobody can ignore
Don't knock it 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more

[Chorus]
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

[Bridge]
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up
You got to change it up
And if the day's not right
Just brush it off tonight
Put on the attitude
You're in the pocket mood
And when you've had enough
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up

[Breakdown]
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off, take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

[Chorus]
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off

What I'm sayin', what I'm sayin'

Take it to another level
This is the remix

[Chorus]
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down

Break it down, break it down
I've got something to say
When you're dancing with me
It's like we go M-I-A
Make a scene, make a scene
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, till you rock it
We can't take it no more

[Chorus]
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up! Shake it up!
All together now

[Bridge]
Sh-sh-sh-Shake it up
You gotta change it up
And if the days not right
Just brush it off tonight
Put on your attitude
You're in my pocket, move
And when you've had enough

[Intro]
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
She was too young to be the Hollywood type
Too pure to understand the lows and the highs
She didn't know if she was gonna survive
It all got so much better with time

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the evil eyes
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that

[Chorus]
'Cause she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second-guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her


[Verse 2]
She didn't know all of the hurt she could take
Her world was crumbling and so was her faith
Wish I could talk to her 'cause what I would say
"Oh baby, you're enough to get you out of this place"

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the flashing lights
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that

[Chorus]
But she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second-guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

[Post-Chorus]
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I tried to tell her


[Bridge]
(Ah)
I know you'll get the chance to find who you are
I know you'll have a choice before it gets too dark
(Ah)
I know you'll get the chance to find who you are
I know you'll have the choice

[Chorus]
She was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons (Hey)
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions (Wish I could show you)
Didn't need the second-guessing (Wish I could show you)
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

[Outro]
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Wish I could show you)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Wish I could show you, I tried to tell her)
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Wish I could show you)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Wish I could show you)

[Verse 1]
You know fairytales don't come true
Not when it comes to you
I opened up for the first time (First time)
And you can bet that it's the last time
And I'm cool with laying low
It's saturday night and I'm staying home
I'm feeling good for the first time (First time)
It's been a while since the last time
I'll wave goodbye, when you say hello, whoa

[Chorus 1]
I'm sick of the sleepless, never-ending nights
I just don't care who is wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumors and the alibis
You tear me up, I'll cut you down to size
I'm so so so so sick of you, so sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
I'm so so so so sick of you, so sick of you
Sick of all the girls by your side
What you don't know, is how great it feels to let you go

[Verse 2]
I get your game, it's so see-through
You know I'm way too good for you
Moving on to the next time
Drop the baggage and I'll be fine
With time to reminisce
You're gonna realize you miss this
You're on my mind for the last time
And at the most you were a past time
I'll wave goodbye, when you say hello, whoa


[Chorus 2]
I'm sick of the sleepless, never-ending nights
I just don't care who is wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumors and the alibis
You tear me up, I'll cut you down to size
I'm so so so so sick of you, so sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
I'm so so so so sick of you, so sick of you
Sick of feeling not by your side
What you don't know, is how great it feels to let you go

[Bridge]
I'm happier alone
Take down your pictures and I'll throw those memories out the door
I'm sick of you, so sick of you, sick of all of your little lies

[Chorus 3]
I'm sick of the sleepless, never-ending nights
I just don't care who is wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumors and the alibis
You tear me up, I'll cut you down to size
I'm so so so so sick of you, so sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
I'm so so so so sick of you, so sick of you
So I'm getting on with my life


[Outro]
I'm so so so so sick of you, so sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
I'm so so so so sick of you, so sick of you
So I'm getting on with my life
I'm so so so so sick of you, so sick of you
So sick of you, whoa
I'm so so so so sick of you, so sick of you
So sick of you, whoa
What you don't know, is how great it feels to let you go

[Verse 1]
Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh

Break it down and drop it low, low

[Verse 1]
We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment, but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
And we'll play the same game every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Verse 2]
Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next, and I want so much

[Pre-Chorus]
Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Bridge]
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
Yeah!

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Outro]
You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I gave you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober




[Verse]
As I turn back and I look your way
I notice one thing that will never change
But I might find myself
Curious to a darker time
As I find my way to a new side
Puts all in space with a foreign mind
But I might find myself
Find myself

[Intro]
Chills

[Verse 1]
New York back in August, tenth floor balcony
Smoke is floating over Jane and Greenwich street
Goosebumps from your wild eyes when they're watching me
Shivers dance down my spine, head down to my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you

[Chorus]
You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep

[Post-Chorus]
Giving me chills
Chills

[Verse 2]
Sunset Tower lobby, waiting there for me
In the elevator, fumble for your key
Kissed in every corner, Presidential Suite
Opened that Bordeaux from 1993


[Pre-Chorus]
Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you

[Chorus]
You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep

[Post-Chorus]
Giving me chills

[Bridge]
Take my, take-take my breath away just like
Take my breath away just like a souvenir
Take my, take-take my breath away just like
Take my breath away just like a souvenir

[Chorus]
You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees (A hundred)
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep (Puts me, yeah)
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep


[Outro]
Giving me chills
Take my, take-take my breath away just like (You're giving me chills)
Take my breath away just like a souvenir
Giving me chills
Take my, take-take my breath away just like (You're giving me chills)
Take my breath away just like a souvenir

[Verse 1]
I can tell by the way you feel
Something ain't going your way
Jeans too tight and your hair ain't right
We all get some of those days
Oh, throw that mirror away
Oh, you know it's gonna be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Take it down
Shake it out on the floor
You'll get over it
Let it drop, make it stop, oh

[Chorus]
When you feel like nothing, everybody's something
You and your friend, everybody jump in
Look at us now, everybody shout out
Oh, in the spotlight
No matter what you're outside, get in with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybody's something
Oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight


[Verse 2]
I got all an "Uh oh" on my face
Wish I could press "Delete"
We all got something we don't like
Even Angelina Jolie
Oh, throw that mirror away
Oh, don't be going M.I.A

[Pre-Chorus]
Take it down
Shake it out on the floor
You'll get over it
Let it drop, make it stop, oh

[Chorus]
When you feel like nothing, everybody's something
You and your friend, everybody jump in
Look at us now, everybody shout out
Oh, in the spotlight
No matter what you're outside, get in with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybody's something
Oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight


[Bridge]
I can tell by the way you talk the talk
That something ain't going your way
'Cause your jeans too tight and your hair ain't right
Well, we all get some of those days
Just take another deep breath, try to hit your reset
You know that I can relate
Put your hands in the air
Now let me hear you shout out
Well, get out of my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Take it down, shake it out on the floor
You'll get over it
Let it drop, make it stop, oh

[Chorus]
When you feel like nothing
Everybody's something
You and your friend, everybody jump in
Look at us now, everybody shout out
Oh, in the spotlight
No matter what you're outside, get in with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybody's something, oh
When you feel like nothing
Everybody's something
You and your friend, everybody jump in
Look at us now, everybody shout out
Oh, in the spotlight
No matter what you're outside, get in with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybody's something
Oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight



[Verse 1]
You were the one, the one that I could run to
You were the one, the one that I would beg for, no
And you were the one that made me believe that I could be better
Yeah, you were the one, the one that I would run to

[Chorus]
Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
You had a way of making me feel special, yeah
Then take it away and say I wasn't special, no
And now it's messed up that bad kind of love
Is the only thing that makes me better
Yeah, you had your way
I'm trying to pull myself together

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Oh, it should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know
It should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know

[Chorus]
Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh




[Verse 1]
Wake up to your dreams
And watch them come true
I'll make you whisper my name
And never leave the room
Night and day, I'll be your muse
No other girl can make you feel the way I do

[Chorus]
I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon
I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance
Dance, dance for you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid
Close your eyes
Let me take you to places that you've never been tonight
I thought by now you'd realize
I can do anything I put my mind to, ooh

[Chorus]
I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon
I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance
Dance, dance for you, you, you

[Bridge]
Everything I touch turns to love
Everything I do will open up heaven
Instead of us falling, we're flying in love
Nothing's forever because we are just
Stardust

[Chorus]
I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon
I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance
Dance, dance for you, you, you

[Outro]
I can make the stars dance
I can make the stars...
I can make, I can make...
I can make the...
I can make the stars dance
The sky is everywhere
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance
Dance, dance for you, you, you

[first verse]
Your smile was the purest thing in our miry story
It shined like the sun and it lighted up my world
I have never thought that it could blind me
Or i would fall to my knees with your one word

[Chorus]
You brought me to my knees to keep me crawling
I always knew that you'd never let me survive
All this time, baby, i have known i'd be falling
Now, i'm dying in your eyes just to stay alive

[second verse]
We had just one life to live and spend together
But we couldn't make it, we couldn't even try
I always chase you down when you got farther
Baby, but it never ended in a way i didn't cry

[Chorus]
You brought me to my knees to keep me crawling
I always knew that you'd never let me survive
All this time, baby, i have known i'd be falling
Now, i'm dying in your eyes just to stay alive

[bridge]
Breathing under the water like i'm drowning
I'm going deeper down, i'm going way too deeper
I'm afraid if it could kill me but i'm already losing
Ain't nothing else could kill me like you, like you

[Chorus]
You brought me to my knees to keep me crawling
I always knew that you'd never let me survive
All this time, baby, i have known i'd be falling
Now, i'm dying in your eyes just to stay alive
I'm falling from your eyes just to be alive




[Verse 1]
You think you know me so well
You put me down, it builds you up
You're kicking me around
You just can't get enough
And all your friends surround you
And without them by your side
You start to show your weakness
It's something you can't hide
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, stop and erase
'Cause I'm gonna wipe that smile off your know-it-all face (Whoa)
Laugh while you can
You're living it up, but read my lips
The joke is on you (Whoa)
I figured it out
You're all about walking tall on the people you knock down
Well, stop and erase
'Cause I'm gonna wipe that smile off your know-it-all face (Whoa)

[Verse 2]
I'm waking up, I'm feeling
What I was scared to feel before
I got my eyes wide open
Won't take it anymore
All the lies and teasing
Guess I could never be that cool
You had them all believing
But now that's through
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, stop and erase
'Cause I'm gonna wipe that smile off your know-it-all face (Whoa)
Laugh while you can
You're living it up, but read my lips
The joke is on you (Whoa)
I figured it out
You're all about walking tall on the people you knock down
Well, stop and erase
'Cause I'm gonna wipe that smile off your know-it-all face (Whoa)

[Bridge]
Countdown
The tables have turned
Better wise up
You've got a lot to learn
'Cause you're all alone now

[Chorus]
Well, stop and erase
'Cause I'm gonna wipe that smile off your know-it-all face (Whoa)
Laugh while you can
You're living it up, but read my lips
The joke is on you (Whoa)
I figured it out
You're all about walking tall on the people you knock down
Well, stop and erase
'Cause I'm gonna wipe that smile off your know-it-all face (Whoa)

[Chorus]
Well, stop and erase
'Cause I'm gonna wipe that smile off your know-it-all face (Whoa)
Laugh while you can
You're living it up, but read my lips
The joke is on you (whoa)
I figured it out
You're all about walking tall on the people you knock down
Well, stop and erase
'Cause I'm gonna wipe that smile off your know-it-all face (Whoa)




[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
There's no sophistication in my lack of patience
I'm just wishing you were better at communication
As I sit here steady waiting
Wishing that you would call my name in

[Pre-Chorus: (Selena Gomez) & Justin Bieber]
(Wishing I was better with the distance)
It's cause you're the only one I'm really missing
Nobody else would be forgiving
Cause of all the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me, give me
(Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change)
Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Gotta be strong, strong, strong
Gotta be strong, strong, strong

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
What should I do? Should I go?
Who do I talk to? Nobody knows
Who knows the answer to all of my questions?
When will I get over this, over this?

[Pre-Chorus: (Selena Gomez) & Justin Bieber]
(Wishing I was better with the distance)
It's cause you're the only one I'm really missing
Nobody else would be forgiving
Cause of all that love that you give me
All of the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me, give me
(Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change)
Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Gotta be strong, strong, strong
Gotta be strong, strong, strong





[Intro]
It's summer!

[Verse 1]
The heat is blazing like the Fourth of July
I got the air con on, and it's blasted on high
So just grab something cool and jump in your ride
Pick up everybody, I'll be waiting outside

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
The summer's not hot without you (Can't wait to see ya)
Whoa, whoa
The summer won't start without you
The temperature is 99 and it can get much hotter
So come on over Romeo and vamos a la playa
Whoa, whoa
The summer's not hot, the summers won't start without you

[Post-Chorus]
The summer's not hot
The summer's not hot 'til you show up
The summer's not hot
The summer's not hot
The summer's not hot 'til you show up
It's summer

[Verse 2]
You're the reason that I jump in the pool
'Cause you're so hot that I gotta get cooled off, and
All your friends, well, bring them along
Hurry up and meet me, there's a party going on

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
The summer's not hot without you (Can't wait to see ya)
Whoa, whoa
The summer won't start without you
The temperature is 99 and it can get much hotter
So come on over Romeo and vamos a la playa
Whoa, whoa
The summer's not hot, the summers won't start without you

[Interlude]
'Til you show up
'Til you show up
'Til you show up
'Til you show up

[Bridge]
In my heart it's freezing
I am wearing a bikini
And I know the sun is beating down
Wherever you may be
But the summer's not hot to me
The summer's not hot to me
The summer's not hot to me
'Til you show up
The summer's not hot
The summer's not hot
The summer's not hot
'Til you show up

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
The summer's not hot without you (Can't wait to see ya)
Whoa, whoa

So come on over Romeo and vamos a la playa
Whoa, whoa
The summer's not hot, the summers won't start without you

[Outro]
The summer's not hot to me
It's not hot to me
No matter what the temperature is
The summer's not hot to me
It's not hot to me
No matter what the temperature is




[Intro]
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Mmm

[Verse 1]
You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the paint, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours
But now what's mine is ours

[Chorus]
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

[Verse 2]
My sweet devoted counterpart
We catch each other's shooting stars
However close, however far
Whatever's mine is ours
Whatever's mine is ours

[Chorus]
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)

Woahoooo (we are, we are)
Woahoooo (we are, we are)

Woahoooo(we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild

We are survivors (woah)
We are survivors of the wild

[Verse 1]
Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in
There's no way to fake it
Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feeling
I shouldn't believe in the dreams that I'm dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount to much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, tell me something I don't know
Tell me, tell me something I don't know

[Verse 2]
Everybody tells me I don't know what I'm doing
This life I'm pursuing
The odds I'd be losing
Everybody tells me that it's one in a million
One in a billion
One in a zillion

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount to much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know

Something I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

[Bridge]
Selena, hit the track
Like Katrina, making waves
Like Cold Medina, make them say, "I'm ready!"
Are you ready for it? (Yeah, I'm ready for it)
Really ready for it? (Yeah, I'm ready for it)
I'm on my way
I know I'm gonna get there someday
It doesn't help when you say it won't be easy

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know

[Verse 1]
When I wanted you, you would not reciprocate
When I needed you, you would always show up late
But things have changed and I've got the upper hand
You come running, I've got you eating out of my hand

[Chorus]
That's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
I say where and when it happens
That's more like it
That's more like it
(That's more like it, that's more like it)

[Verse 2]
When my birthday came, you would not remember it
When I talked to you, you were never listening
But tables turn and it's great to be on top
Got you trained to appreciate the good that you've got

[Chorus]
That's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
I say where and when it happens
That's more like it
That's more like it
(That's more like it, that's more like it)


[Bridge]
I like chocolate
And I like daisies
Maybe you better write this down
I love cashmere
And I want diamonds
I'm ready for my massage right now
Oh, right now

[Chorus]
That's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
I say where and when it happens
That's more like it
That's more like it
(That's more like it, that's more like it)

What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants


[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear

Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

Wasn't it written all over my face? Yeah
I loved you like you loved me, oh
Like something pure and holy
Like something that can never be replaced

[Chorus 2]
And it was wonderful
It was magical
It was everything I've waited for, a miracle
And if I should ever fall in love again with someone new
Oh, it could never be the way
No, it will never be the way
I loved you




Seems like things have changed 




[Snippet]
My heart skipped a beat when you smiled
Then my heart beat me up for a while
'Til I finally met the moon


Got some top secrets, 12 AM text me back , baby you're my top secret

Complete lyrics available upon release. Stay tuned!

(Aaaaaaah toooo) So

[Pre-Chorus]
My body feels like chess , no no no it's not stress

[Chorus]
When I see my Totem, I remind that I'm not broken



[Verse]
Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me
You can sleep safe and sound
Knowing I am around

[Chorus]
Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

[Bridge]
Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

[Chorus]
Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me




[Verse 1: Luke Hemmings]
When you're out with your friends, it makes me think about your deceased people
This is going to be me who wants to be with you instead
There's no different version of me and you
We are capable of doing anything

[Chorus: Luke Hemmings]
Do you trust me, baby?
Do you trust me when I say there's plenty I can do?
Yeah, baby, do you trust me?
I wanna have a girlfriend who trusts me

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I feel heartbroken, my mom or dad doesn't trust me
But nothing's wrong as long as I'm with you (Hmm)
I'm capable of loving you as much as I can
That same old love from my ex is gone
Now I'm happy to have you here

[Chorus: Luke Hemmings]
Do you trust me, baby?
Do you trust me when I say there's plenty I can do?
Yeah, baby, do you trust me?
I wanna have a girlfriend who trusts me

[Bridge: Luke Hemmings]
When you're broke, when you're hurt
You can trust me
Because I'm your all-time boyfriend
No one else can trust you but me, I promise

[Chorus: Luke Hemmings]
Do you trust me, baby?
Do you trust me when I say there's plenty I can do?
Yeah, baby, do you trust me?
I wanna have a girlfriend who trusts me

[Verse 1]
I look at you and all I wanna do is just disappear (Oh)
I got a craving for you, baby, can we get outta here? (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You're a sexy machine
You're a hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd
Somewhere no one's allowed
I want you...

[Chorus]
All to myself
I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows
And pull the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows, yeah
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

[Verse 2]
I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark (Oh)
And you can navigate me like the map that you know by heart (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You're a sexy machine
You're a hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

[Bridge]
I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like the map that you know by heart

[Breakdown]
All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah
You dont need no other lover
You dont need no other lover
You dont need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

[Outro]
You dont need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Feeling so good, so great
Until I really look into your eyes
Tell me how bad it is, what you did
'Cause you know that I'm not about that life

Your secrets have secrets, that's no lie
Why we gotta be so under the weather
We can only have ourselves, can't rely on nobody else
To put your pieces back together

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find?
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie?

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
Easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Never would give you away
You'll be unfamiliar with pain
You'll never cry

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I've been feeling down for a while
Wishing you could see beyond my eyes
You know very well what I did
Swear that I'm not about that life

I told you my secrets that made you cry
Said you want the truth thought it'd make you feel better
We can only grow from here
Do reconstruction
And put the pieces back together (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find? (I was wrong, I was wrong)
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie?

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

[Verse 3: Maejor Ali]
Yeah, If I told you that I miss you
Would you understand it?
Or would you take it for granted?
I miss the little things, talks about the stars and the planets
And you speaking to me in Spanish, "Te extrano"
Can't even lie
Lately things have been different
You was my sweet tooth
Now it seems I need a filling
And now that the pain is numb, I'm looking for a feeling
The fast life isn't as appealing
You still listening?
If you are, I wonder how you have been nowadays
I know we haven't talked much since we parted ways
I know I missed your birthday, a couple of holidays
I never knew it'd be this hard with you far away
Secrets, all this over some secrets
I look back and tell myself to keep it
I wish that I had looked you in the eye and just told you a lie
'Cause I cared too much to see you cry

[Outro: Selena Gomez]
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide




[Verse 1]
If I give you every piece of me, I know that you could drop it
Give you the chance, I know that you could take advantage once you got it
If I open up my heart to you, I know that you could lock it
Throw away the key, and keep it there forever in your pocket
If I give the opportunity to you, then would you blow it?
If I was the greatest thing to happen to you, would you know it?
If my love was like a flower, would you plant it? Would you grow it?
I'ma give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it?

[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

[Chorus]
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable

[Verse 2]
If I hand you my emotions, would you even wanna take it?
(Would you even wanna take it? Yeah)
If I give you all my trust, then would you fumble it and break it?
(Mm, mm, mm, mm)
If I let you cross my finish line, then would you wanna make it?
(Would you wanna make it, would you wanna make it?)
I think I'm ready, won't you come and flip the switch and activate it? (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

[Chorus]
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I'll stay vulnerable

[Non-Lyrical Vocal Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

[Chorus]
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I'll stay vulnerable
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go
I'll stay vulnerable




We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game

Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Ooh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do


[Outro: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
We don't talk anymore, oh, oh
(What kind of dress you're wearing tonight)
(If he's holding onto you so tight)
The way I did before
We don't talk anymore, oh, whoa
(Should've known your love was a game)
(Now I can't get you out of my brain)
Ooh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore

[Chorus]
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Verse 1]
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame


[Chorus]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Verse 2]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame


[Chorus]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

Like we used to do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do


[Outro]
We don't talk anymore, oh, oh
(What kind of dress you're wearing tonight)
(If he's holding onto you so tight)
The way I did before
We don't talk anymore, oh, woah
(Should've known your love was a game)
(Now I can't get you out of my brain)
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain


[Chorus: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez]
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do


[Verse 1: CASH L3WIS]
I get home from work, you get home from work
You on the phone though, can't put it down like it's a curse
It's the worst, all I want is time with you
But it's hard to find, a few minutes that align with you
I get inclined to decline that you're mine the truth
Is in the lines, I design in my mind - the booth
Is where I find - I can rhyme & release the flow
Of the pain obtained while being alone, don't wanna know



[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain


[Chorus: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez / CASH L3WIS]
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do


[Verse 2: CASH L3WIS]
I Don't know where you've been
But I know You've been lost
Covered in frost bite, I'm up all night
With a beer and a cross, sitting across
From an empty vessel
Sad shell of what used to be
& I'm confused as to who you really are anymore
How'd we lose what was you and me
All your fluidity turned to acidity
Visibly hindering ability
Like you wanna get rid of me
And I'm not really sure that you're into me, anymore
Which is injuring me even more
Why'd you lock your love up in a drawer
Cutting and stabbing my heart to the core
You just ignore, so



[Chorus: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez / CASH L3WIS]
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore (nah)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do (nah)
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for? (tell me)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I miss you


[Outro: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain



[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Is it alright if I'm with you for the night? (Night)
Hope you don't mind if you stay by my side (My side)

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
We can drive in your car, somewhere into the dark
Pull over and watch the stars (Oh, oh, oh)
We can dance, we can sing, do whatever you think
As long as I'm with you

[Chorus: Selena Gomez & Pixie Lott]
When we are together, it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend the weekend dancing, 'cause we sleep when we die
Don't have to worry about nothing
We own the night! (Ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (Ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (Ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (Ah-ah-oh...)

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
It's all a blur
It's getting late, but I don't care (I don't care)
I don't know where we'll end up and that's okay

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
We can drive in your car, somewhere into the dark
Pull over and watch the stars
We can dance, we can sing, do whatever you think
As long as I'm with you (Whatever you did)

[Chorus: Selena Gomez & Pixie Lott]
When we are together, it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend the weekend dancing, 'cause we sleep when we die
Don't have to worry about nothing
We own the night! (Ah-ah-oh...)
We own the night! (Ah-ah-oh...)

[Bridge: Selena Gomez & Pixie Lott]
Nothing lasts forever
Let's live it up when we're together
Nothing lasts forever
So let's live it up, just do whatever
(Do whatever, do whatever, do whatever)

[Breakdown: Selena Gomez & Pixie Lott]
When we are together, it's the time of our lives
We can do whatever, be whoever we like
Spend the weekend dancing, 'cause we sleep when we die
Don't have to worry about nothing
We own the night!

[Chorus: Selena Gomez & Pixie Lott]
When we are together, it's the time of our lives

Love in my lungs, never ever gon' forget it
[?] in my blood, always love to go and wreck it
Kissed you in the corner at the party
Still remember all the angles of your body, oh
Love in my lungs, never ever gon' forget it

Every time you hear me on the radio
Hope you know there's truth in every word I wrote
Eve though it's over, I enjoyed the show

Kissed you in the corner at the party
Still remember all the angles of your body, oh

I want the danger, diamonds and strangers
Liquor and limousines
But if we met later, we could be greater
Would you still fall for me?
I want the danger, diamonds and strangers
Liquor and limousines
But if we met later, we could be greater
I know you'd fall for me, ya

Every time you hear me on the radio

[Verse 1]
Been a long day
Waitin' for the night to come
I check my iPhone
Let me see what's going on, going on, going on
Help me, DJ
Play my favorite song
Make the speakers shake, speakers shake
Now, everybody wants to sing along, sing along

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When the night is here
The only thing on my mind is having a good time
When the moon appears
You can always hear us say...

[Chorus]
"The party doesn't start 'til the sun goes down"
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody up when the sun goes down
Ah, ah, ah
The music isn't on 'til it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down

[Post-Chorus]
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Pushing my hands up
I'm feeling good now
On the dance floor
We can turn it inside out, inside out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When the night is here
The only thing on my mind is having a good time with my friends
That's real
You can always hear us say...

[Chorus]
"The party doesn't start 'til the sun goes down"
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody up when the sun goes down
Ah, ah, ah
The music isn't on 'til it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Down, down, down
The sun is going down, down, down
When the moon appears, you can always here us say
When the stars come out, you can always here us say
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus]
"The party doesn't start 'til the sun goes down"
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody up when the sun goes down
Ah, ah, ah
The music isn't on 'til it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down

[Post-Chorus]
When the sun goes down (Hey!)
When the sun goes down (Ho!)
When the sun goes down (Hey!)
(When the sun goes down)
When the sun goes down (Hey!)
When the sun goes down (Ho!)
When the sun goes down (Hey!)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah


[Verse 1]
A baby moonlight hits the spotlight
I'm on my flight to take you away
I'm feeling so free
You're making me crazy
That's what you do, that's what you do
Let's go now

[Pre-Chorus]
Lickety split
A girl in a bit as she falls in a pit saying, "Hello, darling!"
Twisted insanity
Fallen humanity
All I want is some tranquility
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well, c'mon, boy

[Chorus]
Uh, c'mon and take me to the other side
I'm blown away when I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're moving fast
I think we got enough to lose
So, don't look back
Or else we're gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash


[Verse 2]
Like the first kiss with a sweet list
Of some love songs, oh yeah (So sexy, life is sassy, sassy, sassy)
And with this melody falling over me
It makes me weak, so damn weak
So, let's go now

[Pre-Chorus]
Lickety split
A girl in a bit as she falls in a pit saying, "Hello, darling!"
Twisted insanity
Fallen humanity
All I want is some tranquility
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well, c'mon, boy

[Chorus]
Uh, c'mon and take me to the other side
I'm blown away when I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're moving fast
I think we got enough to lose
So, don't look back
Or else we're gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash


[Interlude]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la (la-la) la-la-la (Oh, yeah)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la (la-la) la-la-la
So, let's go now

[Chorus]
Uh, c'mon and take me to the other side
I'm blown away when I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're moving fast
I think we got enough to lose
So, don't look back
Or else we're gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash

[Outro]
(Whiplash...)



[Intro]
I wouldn't wanna be anybody else
Hey

[Verse 1]
You made me insecure
Told me I wasn't good enough
But who are you to judge
When you're a diamond in the rough?
I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't wanna be anybody else

[Pre-Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I'm no beauty queen, I'm just beautiful me
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You've got every right to a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus]
Who says?
Who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurting?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

[Verse 2]
It's such a funny thing
How nothing's funny when it's you
You tell 'em what you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth
It's like the work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Won't let you touch the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I'm no beauty queen, I'm just beautiful me
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You've got every right to a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus]
Who says?
Who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurting?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

[Bridge]
Who says you're not star potential?
Who says you're not presidential?
Who says you can't be in movies?
Listen to me, listen to me
Who says you don't pass the test?
Who says you can't be the best?
Who said, who said?
Would you tell me who said that?
Yeah, who said?

[Chorus]
Who says?
Who says you're not perfect? (Yeah)
Who says you're not worth it? (Yeah, yeah)
Who says you're the only one that's hurting?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty (Hey, yeah, beauty)
Who says you're not pretty? (Who said?)
Who says you're not beautiful? (I'm just beautiful me)
Who says?

[Outro]
Who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurting?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty (Yeah)
Who says you're not pretty? (Who says you're not beautiful?)
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?


He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
But my last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (burnin'), it (it), down (down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (follow), you (you), around
(Follow you around)
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha



[Verse 1]
Fire, it could go and burn you out
A broken hourglass, scattered pieces on the ground
Desire, It could leave you reachin' out
With nothing left, just ashes to be found

[Pre-Chorus]
I watch you walk away, and that's okay
'Cause love is never promised anyway, anyway

[Chorus]
It's just wild love
Can make you act like a maniac
Wild love
You run away, then you're running back
It's so strange, can't explain
This selfish game
It's just wild love

[Verse 2]
We were flyin', faster than the speed of sound
I went left, you went right, but the heavy winds brought us down
Do you ever wonder how chaos, it works out
In the sea of confusion, happiness and doubt

[Pre-Chorus]
I watch you walking out, and that's okay
I guess as long as you got a heart, you got something to break, to break

[Chorus]
It's just wild love
Can make you act like a maniac
Wild love
You run away, then you're running back
It's so strange, can't explain
This selfish game
It's just wild love

[Bridge]
Ain't it funny, how the world when there's a thrill
So we jump on again
It may be sweet, but it can kill, and we don't care
We'll take our chance again
'Til the bitter end, on and on again
That's how the story goes, mmm

[Chorus]
It's just wild love
Can make you act like a maniac
Wild love
You run away, then you're running back
It's so strange, can't explain
This selfish game
It's just wild love (Wild love)


[Verse 1]
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divide, a heavy truth
Water or food, don't make me choose

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Lost in a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

[Chorus]
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

[Drop]
To get to you
To get to you


[Verse 2]
Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Lost in a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

[Chorus]
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

[Drop]
To get to you
To get to you


[Chorus]
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you



In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divide, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night (night)
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you (oh to get to you)
Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly I am following
Break down these walls and come on in
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you (oh to get to you)
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you (oh to get to you)

Letters don't fade, titanium made
Forever here, forever saved

Don't say I can't go with other boys

Don't put me on display

Me & My Girls
-------------------
[Verse 1]
Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man


[Chorus]
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

[Verse 2]
The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

[Pre-Chorus]
If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

[Chorus]
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls


[Bridge]
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

[Chorus / Outro]
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls

[Intro]
Go!

[Beat Drop]

Get Low

[Verse 1]
Chained to a love
But that don't mean much
Sensitive tough, you don't get enough
I've been drowning in your, lost in the rush
Faded, you stuck? I'll help you up

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care if we get too loud
Sexy, I want you now
Bet I could take you there
Whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel?
Let's just enjoy the thrill
I'll take over the wheel
And give you the touch you're missing

[Chorus]
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

[Post-Chorus]
I like the way you take me there
I like the way you touch yourself
Don't hold back, I want that
When the water come down, I'mma get in that
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get low

Stay

[Verse 1]
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

[Chorus]
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

[Post-Chorus]
All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay
Stay

Find You

[Verse 1: Matthew Koma]
Silent love is calling faith
To shatter me through your hallways
Into echoes you can feel
And rehearse the way you heal

[Pre-Chorus: Miriam Bryant]
Make them dance, just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah, you always make me go

[Chorus: Miriam Bryant & (Matthew Koma)]
(I'll run away with your footsteps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself, I will find you)
Yeah, you always make me go (go, go, go...)
(I will find you)

[Post- Chorus: Miriam Bryant]
Make them dance, just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah, you always make me go

Spectrum

[Verse 1: Matthew Koma]
Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama

[Hook: Matthew Koma]
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
We'll run

[Hook: Matthew Koma]
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go

I Want You to Know

[Chorus: Selena Gomez] [x3]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

Stay the Night

[Verse 1]
I know that we are up-side-down
So hold your tongue and hear me out
I know
That we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You cue the lights, I'll drop the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

[Chorus]
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why're you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

Clarity

[Verse 1: Foxes]
Hot dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

[Chorus: Foxes]
Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

[Interlude: Foxes]
Why are you my remedy?
Why are you my clarity?

[Bridge: Foxes]
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

Beautiful now

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
I see what you're wearing, there's nothing beneath it
Forgive me for staring, forgive me for breathing
We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds
'Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We're beautiful
We're beautiful

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful

Addicted to a Memory

[Verse 1: Bahari]
We are, we are a violent chemistry
Love has taken us as far as we can reach
But I can't leave
We are, we are imagined ecstasy
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
A memory
