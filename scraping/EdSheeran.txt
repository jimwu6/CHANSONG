[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?"
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo)
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (Gettin' faded)
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights




[Instrumental]




[Verse 1: Harry]
I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[Chorus: Harry]
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

[Verse 2: Niall & Liam]
We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh love
Let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[Chorus: All & Niall]
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
When we were eighteen
Oh Lord, when we were eighteen

[Bridge: Zayn & Louis & Harry]
Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love

[Chorus: All & Harry]
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen


[Verse 1: Harry]
I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[Chorus: Harry]
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

[Post-Chorus: Niall]
When we were eighteen

[Outro: All]
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love

[Verse 1]
I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (Ooh)
Mmm, we were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs


[Verse 2]
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002 (Ooh)
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang

Icy on a white tee

Baby hairs laid, baby fat and some Nike's
Wanna be my lover, then you gotta keep it spicy
Smile for me daddy, 'cause I wanna see your grill
Ain't no brother boo's here, no, I like 'em hella real
I'm the number one stunna, wha-wha-wha-what?

Hey ma (wassup?)
It's right (alright)
Decide, we can do it tonight
Reminisce till it's light
No, you're feeling me right
We used to  be on a high
You never had the time
We was rushing to grow but finding out, yeah
Uh huh, spending your money
Just to build your credit (ok)
Always in me is the older life of stealing
My overtime is revealing
Now we're just always dreaming of

Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 4 : Ms Banks]
I mean I was so young
And you was so sprung
Sippin' on capri-sun
Like it was white rum
Could never get enough
And I needed your love
Man, you were so tough
Used to play Five [?]
We used to sing 'My Neck, My Back'
But we was too young to be singing that
If my mum heard
Would've beat me for that
Never even had a back
It was my fave track
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

On the day we fell in love, love, love


[Verse 1: Mikill Pane]
I promised you we'd meet up in a week's time
That was nearly two years ago
And even though we don't really speak
I'm happy with the voice I hear through my earphones
Cause I listen to your material now more than ever
And with every punchline I'm like wow, you're clever
I was there when you were making them up
So it's surprising that I still get so surprised
At how amazing they are
But I grin like a fool when I hear your lyrics, man
Even thought they're throw-away lyrics that you wrote for fun
I love the fact that I'm your biggest fan
But I hate the fact that I'm only the biggest cause I'm the only one
The CD's outdated but I need you on my playlist
So I downloaded your 25 tracks to my iPod
And they hurt me every time I make a journey
To play a gig where you should be the headline act

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You can find me floating sky-bound
When you tell me it's my time now
And if I never, ever find out
You will find me floating sky-bound, right now

[Verse 2: Mikill Pane]
Now I've got a few famous names in my phone book
But you're a mate before these friends and I know I should call ya
I love your food for thought and it's always home-cooked
But I'm away on more weekends than a pro footballer
It's partly my fault that we grow further apart
Every time my status grows a foot taller
But you head my list of the best that ever lived
Even when the list is in no particular order
There's no way you're giving me your share of the blame
Cause when you think realistically it's fairer to say
That you quit the game but still remained ahead of your time
Than it is to say that Mr Pane has left you behind
You should be way past my level with a career of your own
The world'll never know that you're the rightful heir to the throne
Cause I'll refuse to play you for the listening pleasure and then explain to them
Why my friend'll never make a penny from entertainment


[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You can find me floating sky-bound
When you tell me it's my time now
And if I never, ever find out
You will find me floating sky-bound, right now

[Bridge: Mikill Pane]
You should've been the greatest ever
I've never put a better playlist together
Than the one with the 25 tracks
That I set as a benchmark whenever I rap
I've got a friend who should be everybody's favourite artiste
And nobody chosen him because they can't see
That he's there because he never wrote for fame, just peace
Nobody knows him, nobody but me

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You can find me floating sky-bound
When you tell me it's my time now
And if I never, ever find out
You will find me floating sky-bound, right now

Last night you spent the night round mine

[Verse 1]
I think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again

[Hook 1]
And now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home

[Verse 2]
Oh well, we've come this far
You're my Venus
And I'm your Mars
And we've passed the moon and stars
And I'm gone

[Hook 2]
But now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm almost gone
When you get home


[Outro]
So please come home

Could you believe? I could be different
I'll be the difference, I'll lift you high
And I understand your hesitation
My reputation, it's no surprise

[Pre-Chorus: Lauv]
So let me redefine you
And you can see the tide move
Just like tears in the eyes do

Oh, baby, I'll be right here
Between the sea and silence
So breathe easy my dear
You can find sunshine in the rain

I will come running when you call my name
Even a broken heart can beat again
Forget about the one who caused you pain
I swear I'll love you in a different way

You've been a victim too many times

[Verse 1]
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

[Pre-Chorus]
And my father told me "son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

[Chorus]
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love


[Verse 2]
And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when

[Pre-Chorus]
And my father told me "son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

[Chorus]
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love


[Bridge]
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And all my brother and my sisters
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah



[Intro]
(One, two)

[Verse 1]
Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

[Pre-Chorus]
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

[Chorus]
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

[Verse 2]
The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

[Chorus]
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body

[Drop]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of


[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, no oh-oh-oh-oh
Said I'm all about it

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don't like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm not a rapper just a singer with a game plan
I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 people in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming "Who want what?"
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the limelight
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds so often guess it's high time
Hoodie sing the line like


[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don't like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, "Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front"
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent
The young prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus

[Bridge]
One for the money
Two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold and now everybody is winning
I'm Larry David plus Miles Davis
So, everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em


[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don't like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby


[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
And they don't know anything about us
Or anything about us
Or anything about it
No, no, no
And they don't know anything about us
Or anything about us
Or anything about it
No, no, no

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
"There must be some way out of here,"
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
Mmm I can't get no relief
This is Monday, drink more wine
Come man dig my earth
None will never lone the line
No one out of this earth

[Verse 1: Devlin]
Yeah
I see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
You'd find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But I'm still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black, it's too cold
I'm all alone take me back to the roads
I had to roam to get here and I'll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother's house
See my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What's a brother for?
When I'm sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money
Full of tears, full of war
I was a ploughman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs


[Hook: Ed Sheeran & (Devlin in brackets)]
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too, yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl (Like a ground man I worked from the earth up)
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl (Cause your world is the same as mine)

[Verse 2: Devlin]
Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
The flavour of an ill-mannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though
That's why they live a lie
I don't think I'll ever win
All of this is anything
When I die I hope a brother's at my side
There's no trap door, or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
You've seen mine, I think it's time I see yours
I bet you that we've been scarred by the same swords
So we are not so unalike
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now I'm trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time
I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics


[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too, yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl

[Verse 3: Devlin]
Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I ain't religious I'm a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
I've been a joker, I've been a thief, I've been a rapper
I've been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view (whoa)
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too, yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl

[Verse 1]
It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?

[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

[Verse 2]
I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to


[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

[Outro]
And oh, I know
And oh, I know
And oh
I can see the stars
From America

[Verse 1]
It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star
And thought of you
I sang a lullaby
If you were here
I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them, too?

[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

[Verse 2]
I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing 'Chasing Cars'
And I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars?
Over Amsterdam
You're the song my heart is
Beating to


[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And, oh, I know
And oh, I know, oh
I can see the stars
From America

[Verse 1]
She can wear a nightgown to a wedding
A t-shirt to bed
Or short skirts in the olden times
Some daisies wrapped 'round her head
You can find my woman dancing in bare feet
On the couch in a ballroom dress
And I love how my baby looks at me
With arms draped 'round my neck

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Oh, honey, just like that"
I give you my loving and you give it right back
I said, "Oh, honey, just like this"
Hanging on, white knuckle grip

[Chorus]
(It's all on my mind)
Feel something when I kiss you goodnight
(It's all on my mind)
Feel something when I open my eyes
(It's all on my mind)
Feel that I could be your sweetest compromise
It's all on my mind
It's all on my mind


[Verse 2]
I could wear wing tips to a wedding
501s to bed
A full suit to the party
We dance 'til all that's left
And I kiss my baby with a sweetness
That only she could bring
And I love how my baby touches me
So play our lover's game

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Oh, honey, just like that"
I give you my loving and you give it right back
I said, "Oh, honey, just like this"
Hanging on, white knuckle grip

[Chorus]
(It's all on my mind)
Feel something when I kiss you good night
(It's all on my mind)
Feel something when I open my eyes
(It's all on my mind)
Feel that I could be your sweetest compromise
It's all on my mind
It's all on my mind
Oohh!!


[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
Me and my baby are bass and the beat
Lo-fi rhythm, the sweat and the heat
Come on lover, won't you follow my lead?
Move on into the night

[Chorus]
But it's all on my mind
Feel something when I kiss you good night
(It's all on my mind)
Feel something when I open my eyes
(It's all on my mind)
Feel that I could be your sweetest compromise
It's all on my mind
It's all on my mind
Oohh!!

[Verse 1]
Chicago on a Friday night
I was walking from a bar with a friend of mine
We heard sirens and saw blue lights
Right in front of us
Seems her man took another mans life
I can search a wrong and never make a right
What's worst by the end of the night?
There'll be somethin' else, somewhere else
As the sun sets over the hills
In Los Angeles and New York
Somebody's tryna find a place to sleep
But daddy's lookin for daughter down in New Orleans tonight

[Chorus]
Hey man, just one more night in America
Hey man, just one more night in America

[Verse 2]
Miami on a Saturday night
Drinks are flowing all around and the pad is wide
Hope is low but the heels are high
Yeah, this town's alive, oh, na-na
She only wanted to feel some love
Didn't get much when she was growin' up
Men tried but they were never enough
She needs somethin' else or somewhere else
And in Vegas, someone's gamblin'
A family dream are two roads down
Her mother lives in poverty, hopin' her soldiers on a call
And say, "Mama, I'm fine."


[Chorus]
Hey man, just one more night in America
Hey man, just one more night in America

[Bridge]
Every time I'm here, everywhere I go
I can see the beauty, I can feel the hope
Oh, and some folks try, some folks cry
Some folks die for the stars and stripes

[Chorus]
Hey man, just one more night in America (Just one more night)
Hey man, just one more night in America (Just one more night)
Hey man (Hey man), it's one more night in America
(Just one more night, oh, na-na)
Hey man (Hey man), it's one more night in America
(Just one more night)
(Hey man, just one more night in America)

[Verse 1]
I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Cafe clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight

[Pre-Hook]
I drill you deep into my chest
That's where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
Cause I don't want to be alone

[Hook]
Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing me another song

[Verse 2]
Cafe clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But we're only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes


[Pre-Hook]
With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue
Cause I don't want to be alone

[Hook]
Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing me another song

[Break]
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sing another song

[Bridge]
Mary Jane
I've been hoping alone
Mary Jane
Since you came along
Mary Jane
I'm almost home
Mary Jane
Sing another song


[Hook]
Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing me another song

[Hook]
Cause everyday that I'm breathing, sweet mary jane
I love the sound of your sweet words, sweet mary jane
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing me another song



[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Lights gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, it's too cold outside
For angels to fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
For angels to fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Fly, angels to fly
Or angels to die

[Verse 1: Bashy]
Look, where I'm from, you don't see angels
Man just see rainfall
Slip you could get a brain fall
Most talk are gonna state rules to get away
It's like castration, takes balls
No word from Gabriel, nah
Could sit back and play the fool (clown)
Or get greedy, try take it all (crown)
All magistrates but don't have it mate
If the funds ain't available, make a line
Start taking calls, that's better than JD Sports innit?
Well the chance to make it's yours, is it?
Just know that the roads in the game are all
Think otherwise a couple gunshots might change your thoughts
Now the youths that you'd fought but you dodge them
Won't ride for you, not even a Taylor's whore shook
Not wanna engage you more
But that ain't what they used to say before
Now you're on your chase wanna change your course
But they are at your yard, straight door to door
Blah! Trust me, now I've seen it happen so many times, you get me
I know the lifestyle's glamorous and that but
Takes you one way

[Verse 2: Bashy]
Where I'm from you don't see angels
Or you do, and the road takes them
And places them in a messed up situation
And kids are amazing but
Not when you got 8 of them
Struggling to provide plates for them
Social end up taking them
Now you can't take the stress
Beautiful girls raised in the ends
Abusive background, caught up in a bad crowd
Picked up and dashed down
In the zones, happens to so many of them
Beautiful, looks could have made them millions
Now they can't even make a penny again
Imagine I would've wifeyed of any of them
Fucking hell
I used to see them at every event
And this shit's so sad man
Imagine that, the never ending cycle

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland, and
Sell love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly

Right past noon, then I'm doomed
Occupied and movin' dolo (Ooh, yeah)
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues (Drown)

Your Song

[Verse 1]
I woke up with a fear this morning
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say, "Love, baby, let's go back to my flat"
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore (oh)
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Post-Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm

Anywhere

[Intro]
Time, time, time, time..

[Verse 1]
Time flies by when the night is young
Daylight shines on an undisclosed location, location
Bloodshot eyes looking for the sun
Paradise delivered and we call it a vacation, vacation

[Pre-Chorus]
You're painting me a dream that I
Wanna belong in, wanna belong in

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
A million miles from L.A
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away
Someplace where no one knows our name
We'll find the start to something new
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you

[Post-Chorus]
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Oh, fun, little less fun
(You take take me anywhere you wanna) Little less, over, over, over, over, me

[Bridge]
Take me anywhere
Oh, anywhere
Anywhere away with you

[Post-Chorus]
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me

[Chorus]
Take me anywhere
Over the hills and far away
A million miles from L.A
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away
Someplace where no one knows our name
Oh, We'll find the start to something new
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you

For You (feat. Liam Payne)

[Verse 1: Liam Payne]
Skin to skin
Breathe me in
Feel with your kiss on me
Lips are made of ecstasy
I'll be yours for a thousand lives (for a thousand lives)

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne & Rita Ora]
I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage (so lost)
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brake
And I'm bleeding in love, you're swimming in my veins
You've got me now (now now)

[Chorus: Liam Payne & Rita Ora]
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you (Ooh na-na, yea)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya (oh, been waiting for love)
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you
(Ooh na-na, yea)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)
Ooh
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you (come on)
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you, oh


[Intro: Rockie Fresh (Ed Sheeran)]
What's her name (Jasmine)
I met a couple like you before
You original though, yeah
Nigga, Rockie checkin' in (Jasmine)
Shit kinda got a ring to it
Fuck with the swag, ride with me

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin

[Post-Chorus: Rockie Fresh (Ed Sheeran)
You know I love it when you dance for me (Jasmine)
But I hate when you make plans for me
Cause a youngin' wanna do what he wanna do

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, now you one of the baddest alive (Jasmine)
You made me take a shot, and straight swallow my pride
I wanna push all these other hoes to the side
It's two seats in the whip if you ready to ride, yeah
So fly that your lows are my ceilings
I just wanna buy you heels and give you sexual healing
[?] understand I'm too willing
And I don't like to argue when I'm smoking and chillin'
Cause nowadays anger's crazy as well
But I been raised well, I'm the son of Michelle
Eyes bout to be ahead, and taught never to tell
I'm slept on, so right now my name might not ring a bell
But pretty soon, by next June, they all gon' be on me (Jasmine)
So if you don't get it, still act like you know me
I'm only twenty-three with the whole world in front of me
And right here is where you wanna be


[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin

You know I love it when you dance for me (Jasmine)
But I hate when you make plans for me
Cause a youngin' wanna do what he wanna do

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh (Ed Sheeran)]
Now you say I know you better than you know yourself (Jasmine)
You say I give you feelings that you never felt
A cool nigga but in seconds I could make you melt (Jasmine)
So you buy me Gucci belts, Louis belts, Fendi belts
And we were slow dancing in the burner room (Jasmine)
While I was trying discrete to pass you was tryna jump the broom
A dirty game, the moment that we found the fame (Jasmine)
Instantly you just knew that that shit was gonna bring you pain
Let's just say that they game is [?] color (Jasmine)
Good to know that you wasn't with me just for the money
Did we make this shit official? Was I really cheating?
Did I not let you kick it with your girlfriends every weekend?
I know we used to smoke together now, right now you tweaking
And yeah, I have my talents shawty, and you know she decent
Okay you know she bad, and yeah, I know you mad
But when we cross paths, I be missing every time he had


[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
When I see you Jasmine, what's a boy to do?
Please come back to me, make my dreams come true
When it comes to heartbreak, what's a little girl like you?
When I'm close to her, make my dreams come true

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin

[Post-Chorus: Rockie Fresh (Ed Sheeran)
You know I love it when you dance for me (Jasmine)
But I hate when you make plans for me
Cause a youngin' wanna do what he wanna do
You know I love it when you dance for me (Jasmine)
But I hate when you make plans for me
Cause a youngin' wanna do what he wanna do



**A Thousand Years**
[Dani]
Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid

[Amy]
To fall
But watching you stand alone?
All of my doubt suddenly fades away somehow

[Lauren]
One step closer

[Katherine]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

**I Won't Give Up**
[Amy]
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

[Christina]
Cause even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

**Thinking Out Loud**
[Dani]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

[Lauren]
And darling, I will be loving you 'til we're seventy
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Lisa]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

**A Thousand Years
[Christina]
I have died every day waiting for you

[Lisa]
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you for a thousand years

**I Won't Give Up**
[Katherine]
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up

**Thinking Out Loud**
[Lauren]
Maybe we found love right where we are




[Verse 1]
Another day, another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated

[Hook 1]
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

[Verse 2]
Another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated

[Hook 2]
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

[Bridge]
Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
I miss you and I wish you'd stay

[Hook 1]
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

[Hook 1]
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

[Outro]
Touch down
Like a seven four seven
We'll stay out and we'll live forever now...




[Verse 1]
Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
'Cause now you're out of sight, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

[Chorus 1]
My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Show me how you want it to be
Oh, tell me, babe, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

[Chorus 1]
My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[Bridge]
Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't've let you go

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Hit me baby one more time

[Chorus 2]
My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time




[Verse 1]
Saturday, me and my girlfriend are at a party in the West End
And I don't really know nobody here either
Maybe we should've stayed home
And turned down the lights so low
Open up a [?] Bordeaux, mmm
And put on a jam so slow, so slow

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "All the girls here are beautiful"
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Why are we even here?
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you
For the same reason that my eyes are too
And that's when she made her move
And whispered in my ear and said

[Chorus]
Hey, let's leave this party (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
Back to my apartment (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home

[Verse 2]
I'm still here with my best friend and I'm not
Disappointed that the party
We just can't fit in with the West End crowd
Can't even hear their conversations, so
Baby, let's hit the road and open up a [?] Margot, mmm
And put on a jam so slow, so slow

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "All the girls here are beautiful"
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Why are we even here?
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you
For the same reason that my eyes are too
And that's when she made her move
And whispered in my ear and said

[Chorus]
Hey, let's leave this party (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
Back to my apartment (Hey-ey-ey-ey)
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home

[Post-Chorus]
Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, no love (Mmm)
Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, mmm

[Bridge]
Turned down the lights so low
And put on a jam so slow, so slow
'Cause all the people are beautiful
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Whisper in my ear, hey

[Chorus]
Hey, let's leave this party (Party, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Back to my apartment (Apartment, hey-ey-ey-ey)
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home

[Post-Chorus]
Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, no love (Back at home)
Come on and get it (Back at home)

[Outro]
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home




[Hook: Ed Sheeran & The Boxettes]
You wake me up, just to keep me down
Stuck in a rush, I'll never feel again
Whispering is all I hear
When I fall, will you take my weight?
And chances are I'll be back someday
Dreams never go away
(You are safe safe safe safe safe safe safe with me)

[Verse 1: Sway]
Pocket money Mummy said go get it from her purse
Now that I'm older and I get it I'ma get it for her first
Not to disrespect my Dad he had me ironing his shirts
Taught me to always increase it and only get it 'cause I work
Play it safe with them in the club, they say all they want is security
So the ladies crack the dress codes so pound notes can sing in key
The hymn sheet providing he actually is a he
With a vision to be rich like Branson sees it vividly
Even if it's not by the book he's going in, lost his virginity
Leading by Example like Elliot, He's got that Billie Jean
But he don't wanna be starting something, that's gonna end up in misery
When Mike said make that change, he took it literally
Now he's staring at the man in the mirror tell him to mirror me (Swah)
You've gotta take a drop to be uplifted
See, he ended up making that real change, spiritually
They ask me why the rap
Let me break it down for you so simply
T-h-e R-a-p y? Guess it's my therapy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sway]
At a surprise party, instead of feeling surprised
You're more pissed to find your loved ones are capable of lies
Growing up everyone of us had something to hide
Cursing in the playground using words we wouldn't say 'round our parents
Couldn't see us F and blind, de-tension in my own worlds got me feeling behind
Asking questions
If you never saw angels in pictures how would you perceive them then?
And if thirteen's an unlucky number what about Jesus then?
He walked with 12 disciples on arrival how many do you see of them?
So many superstitions could be following a lie, and we follow in a line
So far back can't see who's leading them
Some say that they believe but many don't read what they're believing in
The show is never over 'till Tony sings in soprano telling us to breathe again
Giving birth to any idea my mind conceives again I'm here to raise points
Even if you don't agree with them
Some people are saying that men came from apes
Many disagreed and a priest said Amen 'cause if men came from apes then why did the monkeys stay the same then?
Some scientists they lie and twist religions try to say
You know so much about the sky why don't you try and make it rain then?
My moral is don't judge a stranger before you judge yourself
If you love everything around you then you'll love yourself
See I believe we're one you don't agree then you can, wake me up

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
It's a little after midnight
There's a couple in the corner
And I wonder what he said because she's crying
And I guess they won't remember
When they wake up in the morning
With the headache from the whiskey and the wine
I know that I have said things I regret when I am sober
'Cause we always hurt the ones we love the most
I messed up and I know it, if I hurt you girl I'm sorry
But it's good to see the girl I used to know

[Pre-Hook]
We could dance but I can't dance
Maybe we could stick to holding hands
Or should we raise a glass
And forget the past?

[Hook]
If we keep on drinking we gon' fall back in love
So fill it up, fill it up
We must not be thinking 'cause we can't get enough
So fill it up, fill it up
Bartender, can you pour some love?
Bartender, can you pour some love?


[Verse 2]
We can talk about a future, we don't wanna reminisce
Because we both know it was me who got it wrong
But fuck it's good to see you
You look awesome and I miss you
Baby listen now, they're playing our song

[Pre-Hook]
We could dance but I can't dance
Maybe we could stick to holding hands
And let's raise a glass
And forget the past

[Hook]
If we keep on drinking we gon' fall back in love
So fill it up, fill it up
We must not be thinking 'cause we can't get enough
So fill it up, fill it up
Bartender, can you pour some love?
Bartender, can you pour some love?

[Bridge]
And it's closing time, back to yours or mine?
After all this time, you still blow my mind
And it's closing time, back to yours or mine?
After all this time, after all this time


[Hook]
If we keep on drinking we gon' fall back in love
So fill it up, fill it up
We must not be thinking 'cause we can't get enough
So fill it up, fill it up
Bartender, can you pour some love?
Bartender, can you pour some love?



I'll never be your beast of burden
My back is broad but it's a hurting
All I want is for you to make love to me
I'll never be your beast of burden
I've walked for miles my feet are hurting
All I want is for you to make love to me

Am I hard enough?
Am I rough enough?
Am I rich enough?
I'm not too blind to see

I'll never be your beast of burden
So let's go home and draw the curtains
Music on the radio
Come on baby make sweet love to me

Am I hard enough?
Am I rough enough?
Am I rich enough?
I'm not too blind to see

Oh little sister
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, girl
You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Pretty, pretty
Such a pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Come on baby please, please, please

I'll tell ya
You can put me out on the street
Put me out with no shoes on my feet
But, put me out, put me out

Put me out of misery
Yeah, all your sickness
I can suck it up
Throw it all at me
I can shrug it off

There's one thing baby
That I don't understand
You keep on telling me
I ain't your kind of man

Ain't I rough enough, ooh baby
Ain't I tough enough
Ain't I rich enough, in love enough
Ooh, ooh, please

I'll never be your beast of burden
I'll never be your beast of burden
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be
I'll never be your beast of burden
I've walked for miles and my feet are hurting
All I want is you to make love to me

I don't need no beast of burden
I need no fussing
I need no nursing
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sunsdown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah

This is my only fear: that we become

Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers

Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

L.A., mmm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)

'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you squeeze me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up, if we go to Brighton I'll
Take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up, and if you feel too frightened I'll
Make things disappear, dear

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you

[Chorus 1]
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you

[Verse 2]
Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you breathe me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated;
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been jaded, and this love's too overrated;
See what's going on

[Pre-Chorus]
And darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you

[Chorus 1]
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you

[Bridge]
Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road

[Chorus 2]
'Cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left too, I thought I'd put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you
And I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too, I thought I'd put you to a test
And say that I love you, now it seems you loved me too


[Verse 1: Christina Perri with Ed Sheeran]
We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world now darling, so don't let go
Can I call you mine?
So can I call you mine now, darling?
For a whole life time

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran with YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2: YEBBA]
I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA]
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & YEBBA]
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you

[Bridge: YEBBA]
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

[Chorus: Both, Ed Sheeran, & YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you (Whoa)
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you




[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before

Baby, the best part of me is you

Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2: YEBBA]
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA]
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go

Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too

Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
Baby, I'm so in love with you
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you




[Verse 1]
You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

[Pre-Chorus]
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

[Chorus]
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

[Verse 2]
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

[Chorus]
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

[Bridge]
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

[Chorus]
How do you lose the one you love? (How do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man


Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believin' you
You don't what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
And now I've gotta find my own

[Verse 1]
Just lay it all down on me
It's getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I've learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose?
You find my heart is hard to break
Can't keep playing the fool

[Chorus]
Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what's there beyond the pale

[Verse 2]
I feel like I've gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]


[Verse 3]
What can I do
Just to let you know
That you're in my mind?
To try and justify
The way you liberate me
Every time



[Intro]
Bibia be ye ye

[Verse 1]
I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

[Chorus]
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

[Verse 2]
I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

[Chorus]
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)

[Chorus]
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma (be ye ye)

[Verse 1]
Mr. Ruskin come and paint my picture
We're losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now who's your best friend?
Can you introduce me?
See I can't seem to even let you breathe

[Hook]
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind's eye
Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me

[Verse 2]
Come and show me if you can
See I know you're me
But I can't seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
It's psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick

[Hook]


[Chorus: Stormzy]
I said a prayer this morning
I prayed I will find a way
To another day
I was so afraid
Till you came and saved
You came and saved me

And the rain was pouring
'Cause the sun faded away
I'm in a better place
No longer afraid
Blinded by your grace
You came and saved me

[Verse 1: Wretch 32]
Amazing grace that saved the wretch
And now prayers all I got (saved the wretch)
Care is there
I say spades a spade
If you're digging me or not
I'm a heal the world with words
You go heal a load of hurt
And I'm a write 'cause my Gods almighty

I asked for forgiveness
I sold my soul with my business
I sold it all, you're my witness
I even brought in my siblings
Plus I aborted my kids, then
I hear their cries in the distance
That's something I have to live with
Still I reply 'I'm a Christian'
I repent, I repent
Sacrifice all my bread
Give my time up for lent
Every night say my prayers
Cause sometimes I forget
And I swear every time I shouldn't
And cause of you I care every time I shouldn't
But God made man in the light
Of his own image
So I shine bright by my woman
She my better side
And my suns like very bright
And my sky's like heavens sight
And I drop down on both knees
And I raise my arms to exercise my
Love prayer, thug prayer
When I die, let me get a white dove prayer
If God's working overtime
I shall not want unless I grind


[Chorus: Stormzy]
I said a prayer this morning
I prayed I will find a way
To another day
I was so afraid
Till you came and saved
You came and saved me

And the rain was pouring
'Cause the sun faded away
I'm in a better place
No longer afraid
Blinded by your grace
You came and saved me

Yeah
You saved me yeah
You came and saved me
Ohhh, ooh yeah
Yeahhh

[Verse 2: Stormzy, Aion Clarke]
I'm blinded by your grace
Every night and every day
And I was lost, yeah
But ever since you found me


I'm blinded by your grace
Through the darkness you came
And I'll be alright
With you by my side

I can't escape you
I can't replace you
So don't walk away from me now

Easy

(Hook)

I am a man with a heavy heart
And I dare not tear the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction
I...

It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation

(Verse 1)

Listen, music that we play somehow gets glued to your brain
I'm the future when I'm in the booth done like I'm living in 3008
This music gave me a lane to ride in, but there ain't cars in the sky yet, so hold tight
Because I'm in flight like a plane with a lift of a light
You know why? Because I got cold bars hard like crowbars
You can't gamble with no cards
What d'you wanna call it then you get stung like a phone charge
Music mentally uses me like a sailor might use sonar
To find where the flows are, upon an ocean floor that's so dark

(Chorus)


Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
Listen, listen, the music that we play
Will ease your mind

(Verse 2)

My heart falls heavy, like a bankers belly
But when I'm writing songs, I'm happy like chunk when you got away from the Portellies
And there's a musical vibe that usually moves inside of my mind
Therefore I've got a fortune already, and I ain't even talking in pennies
So ride on, my faith is blind like a man who requires a guide dog
And life's wrong, but I stride on regardless of anything I am strong
I got all that I need in a mic and a beat to see how alive I can be
And I got sweet sensation inside of me, because my mind's at ease

(Hook)

I am a man with a heavy heart
And I dare not tear the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction
I...
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation


(Verse 3)

Listen, I wanna say rest in peace, for children murdered on U.K. streets
While the country wages a war, there's a war going on in our very own streets
And I say that life's too short to end up in a morgue or a court
So why not give music a thought and use it to glide like a hawk
Listen, we all get down in the dumps
But when they hear the melody and base line pump
I feel my heart rate jump through the roof and then I run loose on my tongue
Confer with Morpheus if you need proof I'm the one
Or I'll put my heart on the scales to prove that my cardiac muscle weighs more than a ton

(Chorus)

Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
Listen, listen, the music that we play
Will ease your mind

(Hook)

I am a man with a heavy heart
And I dare not tear the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation



In this lifetime, you can mix knives and paper doves
On the roof top, if it craves it's hollowed out

I fell down this daylight
Blind man's arrow
Buried in my love's heart
Tape was wound

Life ties back drop figures and puppets in scissor hands
On the outside all of these words are falling down

I fell down this daylight
Blind man's arrow
Buried in my love's heart
Tape was wound

Porcelain light
A moonless night
In closing

Porcelain light, a moonless night
In closing, always closing
Kept your force, nobody shows
In closing, always closing
Fortunate day, simple to say
In closing, always closing
The curtain is drawn, the lights goes out
In closing, always closing





[Verse 1]
I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

[Chorus]
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

[Verse 2]
I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

[Chorus]
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

[Outro/Collision]
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted


[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm feelin' like a bullet jumpin' out a gun
I'm feelin' like a winner, I feel like the one
You're doing somethin' to me, you're doing somethin' strange
Well, jump back, talk to me, woman
You make me wanna make a baby, baby, uh

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton]
Supernatural woman, supernatural freak
Don't know what you're doin', got me feelin' weak
Oh, I wanna call you fever, baby, you can set a fire on me
Hot damn, pop it like a pistol, mama
You got me down on my knees, begging please

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton]
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind

[Verse 3: Bruno Mars]
You red leather rocket, you little foxy queen
Everybody's watching, pretty little thing
Baby, tell me, what's your fantasy?
Come closer, let's talk about it
You want white lines in a limousine
Whipped cream, and everything in between, yeah


[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind

[Guitar Solo: Bruno Mars]

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]

Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight

Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind

[Verse 1]
I want to be real
Not some conscience to myself
The way you worship, never ending
Some idol who's pretending to be true
How you put upon yourself
A man who never seems
To answer to you words
So go and make me over

[Hook]
I'm a fly upon your neck
You can't control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need

[Verse 2]
Don't want your advice
Cos I've made up my own mind
The way you bore me with the stories
Of far and distant times
I've heard it before
So don't try that on me
The way you worship, never-ending
Some idol who's pretending to be true
It could be you
Brainwashed by the lies
It's no surprise
That you'd wanna waste your time


[Hook]

[Intro]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone

[Post-Chorus]
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams


[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines, what's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive and I walk alone
[Pre-Chorus]
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone

[Post-Chorus]
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams

[Bridge]
I walk alone, I walk a-


[Pre-Chorus]
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone

[Post-Chorus]
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams

[Outro]
I walk a-



[Verse 1: Smiler]
It's a brand new style for the gang who's wild
I came the full distance, ran through miles
Look at all the stripes the boy's earned
I made it, I'll never go back like Cruyff turn
Self-proclaimed new school leader
Few gold chains and a few tools, heaters (blaow)
I'm done with the game, it's been real
Cause I don't need Harry like Kate, I'm Prince Will
I'm no role model, look at the example I set
I'm unorthodox, I'm Example and Wretch
Smiler, a true OG
Been about from Pay As U Go made "Know We"
Me and the mics like dance in Ibiza
The best match made since Harv and Alesha
Hard to believe I came from a hole in the ground
And now it's S-M-I holding it down

[Hook: Smiler & Ed Sheeran]
People calling out
I hear them all around
The game's in order now
Brand new style, let me hear you call it out
Drinks are pouring out
And the vibe, you can feel it all around
It's all in order now
Brand new style, let me hear you call it now

[Verse 2: Smiler]
It's a brand new style for the gang who's wild
This is the rebirth like a brand new child
Look at all the flows I bring forth
I rhyme too ill, when I ball, I bling 'course
A mack, too smooth, black George Clooney
So back you move like the cap on Rooney
When I want birds and a drink, I get goose
And also lemon like Keith, Celeb Juice
I need no name, I captured the title
I bonded the game like Daniel in Skyfall
And all my supporters, course I call them Butane
Gassed on arrival
Come to take mine like charging a VISA
Take an atheist and carve a believer
Hard to believe I came from a hole in the ground
And now the whole game, I'm holding it down

[Hook: Smiler & Ed Sheeran]
People calling out
I hear them all around
The game's in order now
Brand new style, let me hear you call it out
Drinks are pouring out
And the vibe, you can feel it all around
It's all in order now
Brand new style, let me hear you call it now

[Bridge: Smiler]
It's a brand new style
For the gang who's wild
Cause we're young and we live to the fullest
Cashed, we ran through piles
Cause we live for now
Tomorrow come what may
We'll just cross that bridge when we get there
Now, let me hear you say

[Hook: Smiler & Ed Sheeran]
People calling out
I hear them all around
The game's in order now
Brand new style, let me hear you call it out
Drinks are pouring out
And the vibe, you can feel it all around
It's all in order now
Brand new style, let me hear you call it now

*Snippet*
Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heart

Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heart


*Lyrics from Snippets*

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
...always right
And love your mother, she's the reason why we're both alive

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
That's right, my little butterfly, butterfly, you got a long way to go
Darling, just take it slow

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
...wonder if there's only a frame
It's what's inside, that heart following love in those veins
I still see Johnny...
My little brotha, we evolve, we evolve like

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Butterfly, butterfly, you got a long way to go
Darling, just take it slow

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did


Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did



[Verse 1]
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 3]
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh oh

[Verse 1]
Shooting stars shining down on your face
Dancing in the moonlight with you
You keep me calm when I'm a certain disgrace
You keep me on my toes with your moves

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you pulled me inside out and outside in
Give my heart palpitations, keep my pulse racing

[Chorus]
Oh and I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you
Yeah you make my head spin with the things that you do
I feel dizzy when you tell me you love me too
I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
You're making magic got me under your spell
Girl you got the music in you
I'm falling for you and I know you can tell
'Cause you're reciprocating it too


[Pre-Chorus 2]
You turned me upside down and downside up
Give me an education, how to fall in love

[Chorus]
Oh and I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you
Yeah, you make my head spin with the things that you do
I feel dizzy when you tell me you love me too
I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
Oh no, sing it to me now
And I'm head over heels and heels over head
You're the only explanation for my discombobulation, baby

[Chorus]
I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you
Yeah you make my head spin with the things that you do
I feel dizzy when you tell me you love me too
I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you

[Outro]
I feel dizzy when you tell me you love me too
I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you
No I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you



[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill




[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]

Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes

One's brother overdosed

Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill




[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember

[Verse: Ed Sheeran]
Welcome to the city of sin
Livin' in the city of angels
And you'll still hear them sing (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Welcome to the city of sin
Livin' in the city of angels
And you'll still hear them sing
Lullabies to the night
No, no, no



[Verse 1]
She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off of last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke

[Pre-Chorus]
You can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

[Chorus]
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

[Verse 2]
I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

[Chorus]
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

[Bridge]
'Cause I love the way you wake me up
And for goodness sake, will my love not be enough?

[Chorus]
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

[Outro]
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight

What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places

And I won't let go (No, I won't let go)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
And I won't let go (No, I won't let go)

[Verse-1]
Standing at the bar
And your eyes are telling me come closer
But if you could see me dance
There's no way that you would let me hold ya
I feel you pulling on my hand more
and dragging me to the dance floor
all my inhibitions fall away
feel the rhythm of the track
and telling the DJ pull it back...
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say

[Refrain]
Softly do you feel that you could love me
and want me
more than anybody else
but then again

[Chorus]
It could just be the baseline
That made me close my eyes
opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time
that we've been on our own
So I'll hold you close
And never let you go

[Verse: 2]
you can keep me on the dance floor
but I don't wanna waste your time
Feel the rhythm of your hips more
It makes me wanna taste your wine
Its getting hard to keep in time
When I'm looking in your eyes
Everyone but you just fades away
feeling the rhythm of the track
and telling the DJ pull it back
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say

[Refrain]
Softly do you feel that you could love me
and want me
more than anybody else
but then again

[Chorus]
It could just be the bassline
That made me close my eyes
opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time
that we've been on our own
So I'll hold you close
And never let you go

[Verse: 3]
How, could I take you home tonight
I should be hailing a cab
But I don't wanna leave just yet cos I know


[Verse 1]
I'm coming down, coming home
No, 'cause I left without my coat
There's just some things you need to know, know, know
Your eyes, they are a window to your soul
It's such a lovely place to go
Think I should tell you more, you know, know, know

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'm older
Drips are coming off my shoulder, oh
I need its closure
On what you said to me 'cause I

[Chorus]
I can never be mad with you, baby
'Cause the love that we have is amazing
You drive me (Drive me) crazy (Crazy)
But that ain't a bad thing, no, no, no
I can never be mad, mad, mad
I can never be mad

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


[Verse 2]
Now, I don't really wanna fight
Let's keep the conversation light
Spark the candles, pour the wine-ine-ine
My father gave me good advice
Sort out your problems by the time
That you finally close your eyes and I

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'm older
Drips are coming off my shoulder, oh
I need its closure
On what you said to me 'cause I

[Chorus]
I can never be mad with you, baby
'Cause the love that we have is amazing
You drive me (Drive me) crazy (Crazy)
But that ain't a bad thing, no, no, no
I can never be mad, mad, mad
I can never be mad

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


[Bridge]
I can be awful sometimes
But we both just crossed the line
I wanna make this so right
But this time

[Chorus]
I can never be mad with you, baby
'Cause the love that we have is amazing
You drive me (Drive me) crazy (Crazy)
But that ain't a bad thing, no, no, no
I can never be mad, mad, mad
I can never be mad

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Intro: PnB Rock]
Anything she needs, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you
It's FRED again
Anything she needs, she can call me
Don't worry about her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
And she ain't messin' with no other man
And me and her have something different
I really need all you to understand
That nobody's comin' close
And I don't ever wanna run around
I spent my youth jumpin' in and out
But you know I fuckin' love her now
Like nobody ever could

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh, no
I'm stickin' with my baby, for sure
Together, or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
So, if you hear about my lady, just know
That she ain't the one to play with, oh no
And I'll be standin' so close
So you know that, ayy


[Pre-Chorus: PnB Rock]
Anything she needs, she can call me
Don't worry about her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & PnB Rock]
If you cross her, then you cross me (Cross me)
And nobody's comin' close, yeah
And I think that you should know that
If you cross her
(Anything she needs, she can call me)
Then you cross me
(Don't worry about her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)
So come on, and let it go
Oh, I think that you should know

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
That she ain't messin' with no other man
Now, what you not gon' do
Is stand there, 'cross from me, like you got kung-fu
Death stare, cross arm, runnin' your mouth like a faucet
But you don't know that my girl been doin' CrossFit
Pew, kung pow, hit your ass with a cross kick
Pulling hair out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the HBIC
Couple of things that you need to know
If you still wanna be friends with me


[Pre-Chorus: PnB Rock]
Just know if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & PnB Rock]
If you cross her

Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you

Waking up, half past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should've seen the other guy

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles that's why

In my dark times I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
And only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times, in my dark times

Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still calming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But an endless fog's the life I chose

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
Running in circles that's why


In my dark times I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Don't think my mother could love me for me
In my dark times, in my dark times

In my dark times I've still got some problems I know
Driving too fast but just moving to slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go
Pulling me back every time

In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Darling my mother could love me for me
In my dark times taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would not keep
In my dark times this is all I could be
Only my mother could of loved me for me
In my dark times, in my dark times

In my dark times



[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Waking up, half-past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should'a seen the other guy

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
In my dark times, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still coming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose

[Pre-Chorus 2: The Weeknd]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies can never make you believe
Running in circles, that's why

[Chorus 2: The Weeknd]
In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd]
In my dark times I've still got some problems, I know
Driving too fast but just moving too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go of
Pulling me back every time

[Chorus 3: Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd]
In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time
In my dark times

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
There's no way back from here (yeah, yeah)
Only one place left to go, one place left to go now
There's no way back from here (on out)
Only one place left to go, one place left to go

[Plan B]
Is the deepest shame
And to her that is the deepest shame

[Verse 1: Chip]
Uh, heaven or hell, I feel like someone's calling
I'm switching off my voicemail cause I ain't one for warnings
Bolt flow, these niggas can't keep up
You know my verses speak volumes, go and turn me up
See I was just a statistic but I was good with statistics
No council estate oppressions, I had to keep it realistic
My friends are up in the court dog, no plan B
They forced to sell Class A cause there was no plan B
My godson's mummy got nicked, they found a strap in her house
I was as shocked as the feds, I used to stay there myself
Jay, if you hear this I love you, just do that bird, don't speak
I've got some racks put away to help you back on your feet
Fresh outta Broadwater Farm, shoutout to Claps for them curns
Remove the hate from the children, let's teach them discipline first
If love's just a tennis game, I'm swinging my racket first
So RIP Mark Duggan, your justice still isn't served
Yo, the industry can't make me hold my mouth
Lyrically I'm the shit but they know they can't flush me out
North side, money first, whatever second
So niggas take the word hope, rip the O out and sell it
Look, on my past, I ain't dwelling
I'll spend my future repenting
For all my sins, look it's a wrap
And pussy, I am the present
I'm holding up, you hold your mouth
You set the gate, I'll take you out
And respect the fact I made it out
Of where they said there's no way out, I'm real

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Devlin]
You know the apple and core
Head might cost you a score
Or more if you want a meat show on all fours
If not I've got many more girls indoors
Shipped over and told I'll pay em to clean and sweep my floors
How naive, now I got their passports locked in my drawers
The meat show is the best
She becomes so numb to the pain getting raped all day by the pervs and the pests
There's only one more place she can rest (god bless)
So sir just show me your money
We don't take card and we don't take cheque
Even with a latex
For one this is unsafe sex

[Verse 1]
Your love is the strongest thing I know
I reckon it's been doing weights
Eating raw eggs in its cereal
And running ten miles a day
And your love has a driving ban
From trying to steer intoxicated with another love inside her hands
And your love is a friend of mine
So we'll take it care tonight

[Pre-Hook]
If you could only say the words
I'd take it and I'd write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Until the day you found me out
But I know your love
And that's why

[Hook]
I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words

[Verse 2]
And your love
Has never been my enemy
Used to hold me
And promise it would never leave
Never been better since all the therapy
To read the words between the lines
And take away my melody
And your love
Told me it was turning to a different page
And you know, if I let you go
I'll still keep you safe

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You are the one I fall asleep with
But never wake up to
Cause work is something you must do
I trust you like you trust me
It must mean true love
It does exactly what it says on the tin
Let me begin
You are the one I watch the movies with
For recognizing my love for Kiera Knightley for what it truly is
Just an excuse so I don't have to watch Love Actually again
But you're actually the same
It's just to spite me
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it
Until the dishes finished
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it
I tried to make tea once for you in bed
But all I did was spill it
So you made it for me instead
Let me in bed
If you get in ahead of me
It's better to do
Yeah, love is ahead of the truth
But in love
We are better in two
I'll be the newcomer
Stuck in heaven with the devil in you

[Hook]


Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm...

Oooh, I'm overdue
Give me some room, coming through
Paid my dues, I'm in the mood
Me and my girls gonna shake the room

DJ spinning, show your hands
Let's get dirrty, that's my jam
I need that, uh to get me off
Sweating until my clothes come off

It's explosive, speakers are thumping
Still jumping, 6 in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are crashing
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (Can you feel it), 'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival


Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm...

Ah, heat is up
Ladies, fellas drop your cups
Bodies packed, front to back
Move your arse; I like that

Tight hip huggers (low for show)
Shake a little something (on the floor)
I need that (uh) to get me off
Sweating until my clothes come off

Let's get open, cause a commotion
Still going, 8 in the morning
There's no stopping, we keep it popping
Hard rocking, everyone's talking

Give all you got (give it to me)
Just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival


It's the one you been wait'n on
Get up get it rough, yup that's what's up
Giving just what you love to the maximum
Uh-oh (Uh-oh) Here we go (here we go)
What to do when the music starts to drop
That's when we take it to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Uh-oh (Uh-oh) Here we go (Here we go)
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooooh

Yo, hot damn, Doc a Jam like a Summer Show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas (ow!)
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina (what), better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair (han)
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up baby it's Brick City, I heard of that
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac (Bernie Mac)
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB, the way I'm gonna get


Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

What?

[Verse 1]
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Verse 2]
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmh


[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Bridge]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made


[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you

[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe


[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe


[Verse 3]
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (You bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah- la-la-la-la-la
I met this girl, i late last year
She said dont you worry if I disappear
I told her Im not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend
Thinking that the trouble would wait
But then, I jump right in a week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause
Until the moment was right
I went away for months
Until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets until the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
Shes singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
For a couple weeks i
Only want to see her

But we should get on a plane or well be missing it now
Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out
When she was kissing him How?!
I was confused about
She should figure it out while Im sat here singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
*Knock, knock, knock* on my hotel door
I dont even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun
And I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize
What you wanted
Its a bit too much, too late if Im honest
All this time God knows Im singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la



Letra de "Don't" de Ed Sheeran
BELY BASARTE COVER

[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (you bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (you bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe


[Verse 1]
I may know myself, but I realise that I can be led astray
I know, I know that you're bad for my health
But I don't care, I want you anyway
Ayy, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, you think that you know me
Oh, but you can't see my lonely heart
Things look different in the mornin', oh
That's when we find out who we are
Would you still want me?
Without no makeup on my face?
Without alcohol in your veins?
Oh, would you, baby?
Would you still love me?
With all the promises you made
Would you still mean the words you say?
Oh, would you, baby?
Yeah

[Chorus]
You know everybody makes mistakes, mmm
Don't let me be yours
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours, no, don't let me be


[Verse 2]
We may look like hell when it's 6 a.m.
But it's heaven in this bed
I know, I know, I know that you can tell
That we're more than friends
And it's not just in our heads
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, you think that you know me
Oh, but you can't see my lonely heart
Things look different in the mornin', yeah
That's when we find out who we are
Would you still want me?
Without no makeup on my face?
Without alcohol in your veins?
Oh, would, you, baby?
Would you still love me?
With all the promises you made
Would you still mean the words you say?
Oh, would you, baby?
Yeah

[Chorus]
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours, no, don't let me be


[Bridge]
Boy, you think that you know me
Oh, but you can't see my lonely heart
Things look different in the mornin', ah
That's when we find out who we are

[Chorus]
You know everybody makes mistakes, mmm
Don't let me be yours
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours, no, don't let me be
You know everybody makes mistakes, mmm
Don't let me be yours
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours, no, don't let me be



[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Hit the corner, burnin' rubber like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
I met this girl late last year

[Verse 1: One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Rita Ora & Sam Smith]
It's Christmas time and there's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time we let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

[Verse 2: Paloma Faith, Emeli Sande, Guy Garvey, Dan Smith, Angelique Kidjo, Chris Martin, Bono]
But say a prayer, and pray for the other ones
At Christmas time, it's hard but while you're having fun
There's a world outside your window  and it's a world of dread and fear
Where a kiss of love can kill you and there's death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight we're reaching out and touching you


[Verse 3: Seal, Ellie Goulding, Sinead O'Connor, Bono]
Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa
A song of hope where there's no hope tonight
Where to comfort is to fear
Why is touch is to be scared
How can they know it's Christmas time at all

[Bridge: All, Olly Murs, All, Sam Smith, Rita Ora]
Here's to you
Raise a glass to everyone
And here's to them
And all their years to come
How can they know it's Christmas time at all

[Chorus: All]
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it overthinking, obviously
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream

[Verse 1: Krept]
I saw a young G sitting on the wall
Had a gun in his bag on the way from school
I told him, "If you get life you're a fool"
Then he said something that stuck with me
He said, "I'd rather do life, than have none at all"
He said, "Krept, you made it out fam, you're cool"
He said "Me, I slip once, then I'm through
You'd do the same if you was in my shoes"
I said, "Bro, I'm just tryna keep you alive
I'm sick of funerals, another suit and tie
How do you expect me to tell a young G
Put down the guns? That could be suicide
For him it's kill or be killed, fam it's do or die
He said, "Krept, I don't even like this stuff
But I'm in too deep, I'm kinda fucked
I can't think straight when man are tryna line me up"
Just visited my boy today doing life for a crime where he didn't do shit
He said, "Krept, what's good, how's the music?"
Didn't wanna gass it up too much
You know he's stuck doing life, he might lose it
Wishing he was out living life for the movement
When the MOBOs said we were the winners, he told the whole jail "Brap, that's my niggas"
Happy but heartbroken at the same time cause he knows he would have been on the stage with us
Man this cold world could be so vicious
Put your hands together and pray with us
Need to see my family more
So busy that they probably think that I don't love 'em
Probably telling people I forgot about my cousins
He's gone to Hollywood now, man so fuck him
Man I'm stuck


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it overthinking, obviously
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream
Caught up in the same things is giving me life
One can dream
My mind will erase these memories, say goodbye

[Verse 2: Konan]
In New York I met my big sis for the first time, imagine that
I'm 24, it's the first time she sees me
Before he died, promised dad that she'd meet me
I know it ain't been easy, and I can't stay for the whole night
She hugged me with tears in her eyes
And said she wished that he still was alive
She said, your mum sent you Jamaica
She told me you came back ill
Yeah I know you ain't been back still
But you know your friend over there got killed
I know she always had love for me
Then she said something that stuck with me
"Dad said you gotta keep the music alive"
Then she gave the the look like it's up to me
It hit me hard, didn't show it though
Thinking 'bout it on the plane, going home
Growing up without my dad ever round
It's on me and I can't let him down
Before I stepped out the house
My niece said "Make sure you come back again"
Then I started thinking 'bout the hearts that I broke
Praying that the karma don't come back on them
We spoke about everything
And how his wife's tryna take everything
All the inheritance
All because he gave her a wedding ring
So God forgive me for the minor things
Cause you'll risk everything when you're tryna win
And I can't go back, but the more I move forward
The more I start losing the sight of things
Dream chasing


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it overthinking, obviously
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream
Caught up in the same things is giving me life
One can dream
My mind will erase these memories, say goodbye
One can dream

[Verse 1: Ghetts]
I'm in so deep
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real
Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it
So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill
Keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow
And I'm parro, running out of ammo
And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow
The less then the better
More proof for the last one left
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever?
How can I be at my best with this pressure?
I've got a lot to lose
So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds
And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave
And invited more than a hundred guests
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence
It's easier when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda
But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back
Back to 15, [?]
I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat


[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out

[Verse 2: Ghetts]
You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low
And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking?
Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking? I'm floating
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin when it's in motion
Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken?
No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open
I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon
If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you
Arm for arm, eye for eye
I just want to live my life
But they don't want to see this guy survive


[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I, Should I?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

[Verse 2]
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

[Pre-Chorus 2]
On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

[Bridge]
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

[Chorus]
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love


[Verse 1]
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

[Hook]
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk

[Breakdown]
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk

[Verse 2]
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Now I'll watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore


[Hook]
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk

[Breakdown]
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk

[Verse 3]
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again

[Verse 1]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you

[Bridge]
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love

[Hook]
And we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love


[Verse 2]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, you rubbing on it, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right, gangster wife
Louis rags, he sweat it out, he sweat it out, I'm with that
Boy, I'm drinking, now I'm on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body just graining on that wood-wood-wood-wood-woooood

[Bridge]
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love

[Hook]
Now we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love


[Verse 3]
I don't know much about love but I - know I've been shot by you
I don't know much about Algebra but I know 1+1 is two
Cause we ain't got nothing without love
And baby you got enough for the both of us

[Hook]
Cause we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love

[Chorus]
Drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love

[Breakdown]
(I wanna be drunk when I wake up)
(I wanna be drunk when I wake up)
(I wanna be drunk when I wake up)

[Chorus]
Drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love

[Breakdown]
(I wanna be drunk when I wake up)
(I wanna be drunk when I wake up)
(I wanna be drunk when I wake up)



I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to

There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
We'll applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love


I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up, lip sticks to me
So now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to


There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of the clipper when they light up

You know I can't change as I began saying

I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love



[Chorus]
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk

[Verse 1]
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

I'll be drunk
I'll be drunk again (Drunk)
I'll be drunk again (Drunk)

I'll be drunk again (Drunk)
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

Drunk, drunk
Drunk
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
Drunk, drunk
To feel a little love

[Chorus]
Drunk, drunk
I'll be drunk again
Drunk, drunk
I'll be drunk

[Breakdown]
I'll be drunk again (Drunk)

[Verse 1]
Last night I thought I was dreaming
'Cause things like you don't usually happen to me
Outside, the stars were the ceiling
We sang to the moon then we danced underneath

[Verse 2]
I fell so hard but you kissed so soft
I felt my heart couldn't beat enough
You pulled me closer and called my bluff
I am in love, I am enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleeping in on Sunday morning, I am
Lying next to you
Darling, if we're falling sparks we'll fly and
Ignite the fuse
(Like dynamite)

[Chorus]
We are exploding colours that shining purple and green and red
(In the sky)
Love is unfolding before our eyes and lighting the way ahead
(Like fireflies)
This is a memory in our minds that we will never forget
(You and I)
We are the love and we are the night, we are
Dynamite


[Verse 3]
First love with a reason
Darling, hold my hand and take my heart
Say you love me once more with a feeling
And kiss me slow in the back of the car

[Verse 4]
I drop my guard, let you in
'Cause love is ours, it's everything
And we both know, it's simple stuff
We are in love, we are enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleeping in on Monday morning, I am
Lying next to you
And darling, if we're falling sparks we'll fly and
Ignite the fuse
(Like dynamite)

[Chorus]
We are exploding colours that shining purple and green and red
(In the sky)
Love is unfolding before our eyes and lighting the way ahead
(Like fireflies)
This is a memory in our minds that we will never forget
(You and I)
We are the love and we are the night, we are
Dynamite

[Bridge]
We are exploding colours that shining purple and green and red

[Chorus]
We are exploding colours that shining purple and green and red

Love is unfolding before our eyes and lighting the way ahead

(You and I)
We are the love and we are the night, we are
Dynamite

[Verse 1]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, stayed in touch
Used to talk underneath the light on the back of the bus
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way to stay on the phone and talk real late

[Pre-Chorus]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2]
17, and you have a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, uh, suddenly, you turned 23
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, singin'

[Chorus]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Bridge]
Run away now, run away now, run away now
Run away now, run away now, run away now

Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light in the back of the bus

Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus - Sophia & Caroline with others harmonizing]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set

I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing
Ah lah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day ah
Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
I wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

(knock, knock, knock)
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realise what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah

Don't fuck with my love
These girls ain't loyal
That heart is so cold
This girl ain't loyal
Ah lah

Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind (say what)
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Quick when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect 10
I wanna get in
Lemmi get down so I can win, sing it

I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up now)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)

Top Dogg, bite em all, yeah we burning shit up
D-P-G-C now we turning shit up
C-P-T, L-B-C, yeah we hookin back up
And when they bang this in the club baby you got to get up
Thug dealers drug dealers yeah we livin it up
My life, yo' life, boy we livin it up
Takin chances while we dancin in the party fo' sho'
Slip my hoe a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin my hair
Bitch quit talkin, quick walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet and take it down with this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Now get back, come back that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relievin your stress

It goes na-na-na-na-na
It's the motherfuckin D.R.E. (snoop doooooog)
Na-na-na-na-na
You know I'm mobbin with the D-O-double-G

Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
Damn that girls looks good
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
Play on, play on, play on
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
Damn that girl looks good
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo

I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And re: stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I said you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight
To keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone

Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Then as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear
You call me selfish, I understand
But I can't help it
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Uh won't you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, go, oh won't you leave me now

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a road, won't you leave me now
Now




[All, Amy]
Ooh ooh oooh ooh
Mmm
Ooh ooh oooh ooh

[Lisa]
I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Amy, Katherine]
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a love, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were that someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Lauren]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

[Christina, Amy]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Lauren, Lisa]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
The worst things in life come free to us
The worst things in life come free to us

[All, Amy, Katherine & Lauren]
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do (Mmm)
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do (Mmm)
You know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
So come on now, follow my lead
Come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Christina]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

[Lisa, Christina]
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love




I'm just a bachelor, lookin' for a partner
And someone who knows how to ride without even fallin' off
Gotta be compatible and takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off, I promise that you won't wanna get off

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it

I'm sittin' here flossin', peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance, the things I would do to you
You and your body, every single portion
I send shivers up and down your spine, and fluids flowin' down your thigh

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony

Wanna get freaky baby

Wanna get nasty baby

And you can join my jockey team (wooh yeah)

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it




When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
(Ah la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la)
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are




[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game




[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ahh
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1]
Now well when I was young, we connected
When we were a little bit older, both done
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me and rumours are knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
I made some mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm something was born on the Fourth of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, never say it

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't lose you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love, you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Walking on the beach with you right next to me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (wanna' be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ahh
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I buried hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your handprints on my soul
It's like your eyes are bigger, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my own lips

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (me and you)
I wanna be your A-Team (be your A-Team now)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game




[Verse 1]
Across the sea by the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me

[Chorus]
So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose


[Verse 2]
I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me

[Chorus]
I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

[Verse 3]
I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me "son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea"

[Chorus]
And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

[Outro]
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose




[Intro: Rizzle Kicks]
WOO!
Yeh RK, RK, What?
We're the believers, do you believe us?
I can find my place in my dreams
Said I can find my place in my dreams

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Stay with my gristle spit, spittle
Swivelling' with the Rizzle Kicks
Never Fizzle we'll not spit gibberish
Riddle me this, uh forget about it
Hit 'em with just a touch of
Love, A little bit a monsoon
Competition is simply drizzlin', whistlin'
Dicks missed me, with that you will get missed away
Don't you know that' I set my diary...
Earthquakes, tremors, T-vo, when I
Step in the venue, what's next on the menu?
Is intellect process, then tell, Intel, internet
Cream of the crop, Lean when I bop, like a feind
Seize them like Caesar
Mausoleum, when I skene
Super' superb, supreme, Magnetic from Queens
Athletics the words in the verse are mean
U-K, Rizzle Kicks, skip with the team
Pharoahe Monche see the place in my dreams

[Verse 2: Hines]
Say, I'm just a dreamer; with the trumpets dealer
Proper budget feature, but the thunder stealer
Couple drunken tweets, it's here to bust ya speakers
Chillin' with the Kicks, like a pair of comfy sneakers
So put your Zs up this is bigger
Than the cupboard of a comfort eater,
So hush your beats bruv, Leavin' Believers believing
Will end up in an office with my Uncle Peter
Come and see us ramp the beat up
Yeah we'll make their month like Augustus Caesar
Gunna, touch Selena off of Justin Bieber
Just to leave her crying like an onion peeler
He was such a diva; well I'm a quantum leaper
Running my lane like one hundred metres
I'm a scruffy teacher with a drunk demeanour
No sleep till bright and I'm a slumber seeker!

[Hook]
I can find my place in my dreams
Said I can find my place in my dreams

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
Erm, relax
Man it's pro, ha, I man this flow
Tracks about as simple as san dingo
Mingling in an indigo hat, or riddlin' with a dick bigger than Mandingo
Let's have a party, pass me the wine
Pass me your watch while we're passing the time
Ram last me with a Bacardi and lime
Dropping E's in the punch to bring the party to life
Bad of me I know, but it will come back to me
Should a sat at home with a brew and a bag of weed
If you weren't imaginary, it would've been a tragedy
Who invited pat and turn my Nan into an anony
It's the shit I see when I sleep, bro
Which is why I spend most of my time sleeping
Me, I don't spit, I just talk in my sleep
God forbid anybody wake me when I'm dreaming

[Verse 4: Ed Sheeran]
My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold bro
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
So if we're keeping dreams to day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage
With the sold out tours
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are guys that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just a way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow cause

[Hook]
I don't care what you choose as fact
I'm gonna take myself to the moon and back
In my dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)

[Hook 2]
Straight up me to the sand, I'm a spaceman
Yeah, with a suit to match
In my dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams
(My dreams)
My dreams

[Verse 5: Metropolis (Foreign Beggars)]
Yo, who's side parting rules in two thousand and now?
Still swinging on these fools
Never out for the count, wowing the crowd
Rizzle Kicks shouting me out
Thought I wasn't built for this, you can't be doubting me now
We were all team dreamers but only some relate
To Displaying traits that i'll equate to
Freak genius, Crowd in the palm of my hand
Like three creases, boss in the mic
You're not even team leaders

[Verse 6: Orifice Vulgatron (Foreign Beggars)]
Yeah, I'm reaching out from the pinnacle
With a subversive use of crude syllables, I ain't stewed with the use of new palpable
Rap homocides, my hand writes to kill' em all
My vision taught the life line of a vicious brawl
And spring forth you'll laugh like a digger's fool
My lyrics calling out to the dreamers
Pick yourself up, spread love, time we cleaned up

[Verse 7: Chali 2na]
Chali 2na, Rizzle Kicks
Aha-ha-ha
Yeah, we do playing
I'm through playing
Cruise laying cushions cash like new crayons
We move women, I'm try'na improve payment
Kill the crowd then bring them back like it's a group seance
Grace the stage where taste for rage
When my pen touch the page, I complete the phase of MC
And in circus I'm try'na remain relevant
Pulling in this herd, one of the main elephants
Travel the world for irrelevant girls
My life is a rebel just like a javelin twirls
Used to get nervous, don't think just like the frivolous whirls
Not even a care in the world, it's my dreams
Misha touch the rim and reach the nitro rilby
We be the best kept secret like some micro film
At night go see them, or chances might go slim
Better be there when the lights go dim
Because I'm living my dream

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]


[Verse 1]
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser


[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser


[Bridge]
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser

[Chorus]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 1]
I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
They showed me the locked doors I find another use of key
And you'll see

[Chorus 1]
I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser


[Verse 3]
I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner
I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue, and
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngen
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away

[Chorus 3]
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish


[Verse 4]
I wish my family and friends, they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh
And I wish I'd never run through
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, "Fuck you"
I wish I was home more
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for
And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Oh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause
Every day this cocaine gets the best of us
Usin' my balance on razor blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait

[Chorus 3]
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

[Verse 5]
I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat coat
Mum sayin', "Don't smoke," no, I don't listen, I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me, "Work hard and you can never be shit"
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Set back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had
One wish

[Verse 1: Bure (Ed Sheeran)]
Comfort in my pain?
That's kinda backwards
I'm sitting on the sideline when everybody smoking backwoods
I wanna erase my life and my soul and be done
But leaving my family hurt, no it would not be fun (Blame it on the pain)
Imagine my momma, sobbing on the floor
Knowing there will be no son to walk through that door
I couldn't take that
She done suffered too much
To have her framily support her
Like she wearing a crutch
I say hold tight mama
I ain't going nowhere
Dry your tears mama
There ain't no need to despair
Your son's gonna do well, I promise you that
I'll be universal just like a diplomat
All my life, been warning me about these caveats
And these copycats that won't get off my back
I be cranking up the heat just like a thermostat (Industry)
Welcome me, I'll be right there just like a Diplo mat, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 2: Bure]
Yo
Getting through this shit is kinda hard
Tryna speak up when I didn't have a lotta heart
My heart so black it's looking like it been charred
Momma told me in these times you gotta be smart
I believe to express is a human right
I'm outta sight
I'm hungry got an appetite
I'm going boom
Blowing up like a dynamite
Hurting other people man, that's my kryptonite
Can't take it
Wanna and gonna do something 'bout it
Wanna say something I'ma go ahead and shout it
To the world, this the truth man you don't wanna doubt it
See it in your face, don't wanna be a lout about it
I haven't said what I wanna say yet
Damn I just can't say 'no' when Jesus say 'yes'
Got that brown skin like India.Arie
All for all I've hurt for the last time I'm sorry


[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Bridge: Bure]
You can't please everyone
I know that now
Trust nobody
I live by that vow
My demons, they here
They won't go away
But when they do
I'll be ready for the day
You can't please everybody
I know that now
Trust nobody
I live by that vow
My demons, they here
They won't go away
But when they do
I'll be ready for the day


[Chorus]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser



It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight, hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today, hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on


[Verse 1]
It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight, hold on

[Chorus 1]
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

[Verse 2]
It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today, hold on

[Chorus 2]
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on

(You good to go?)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift &  Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to break your heart, I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight?
I wish I never called you up, and nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
And won't you just hold me tonight?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will stop trying to fall in love again, and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you are the only one for me, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want

[Verse 2]
I never meant to sleep around, I was just lonely
And you did the same, again and again and again, whoa I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will stop trying to fall in love again, and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you are the only one for me, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want

[Bridge]
When I see my future, it is with you
And we'll get there
And I want my children to be with you
And we'll get there

[Chorus]
Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want

[Outro]
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Faces change
But this place'll stay the same
And I'll know when I'll go
Home

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yeah, and I'm pickin' up another bag
And I pack another knapsack
The airport's like a stop light to me
Sittin' on red, green light go
Can't see my family
My family grew into a globe of friends and fans
Or some may call 'em
And it's on the stage I stand
To jam, rock, sing
No wakin' up to stop the dream
I lived the life, signed a picture
Cause no dam could stop the stream
Or flood gates, I'm in a fucked race
And a pocket fulla culture condoms
They put you on the podium for first place
But on the block, they judge you on 'em
So
Who got the South in a six-pack, and a shotgun just for show?
I put the white boys back in gold teeth
Put the hood in mossy oak
I'm the
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life
Beat me down with criticism
But at least the critic's write
With a broken pen, there they go again
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' gem
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in
I'm goin' home, I'm home again
Bring it back up in the U.K
With a Dixie flag and a sixty sack
Catfish Billy, hell, you say
I'm just bein' blunt, homie
Keep the grass
(Now bumper sticker that, drop a rap and change me)

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Yeah, take one look
Better yea? Take two
But if I take that break, as a move you made
This dude you shape, will come take you back
Back to the roots of bein'
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in
Or a spot to sleep in
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season
Cuz I am not the reason
That the image you're used to seein'
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless
Meaning yes, I'm different
Differently made
And me screamin' the A
Is not the difference in grades
It's the place I stayed
Cuz the schools were underpaid
The teachers taught, but to me they fought
The star that was underway
It was under Wayne, it was in my name
Michael, M.W.A
Atha
And in trouble I stayed
Breakin' out of this bubble they made
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand
Committed to the words I say
A blood-line's not a family-tree
It's a needle in my skin for all to see
I ain't never got a spring-break tattoo drunk
But I drink and take the ink
(Shirts off, you can't, you can't change me!)

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly


[Verse 1]
Walking down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier, you do
'Twas Christmas Eve babe
Well, in the drunk tank
An old man said to me, won't see another one
And then he sang a song
The Rare Old Mountain Dew
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Chorus 1]
And the boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing Galway Bay
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 2]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darlin', I am so in love with you


[Chorus 2]
Oh, the boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing Galway Bay
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day
Oh, the boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing Galway Bay
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Outro]
'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you



You and I
Two of a mind
This love's, one of a kind
You and I
We're drifting
Over the edge

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

You and I
We're learning to speak
With kisses on cheeks
You and I
We're lifted
Over the edge

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?


[Verse 1]
You and I
Two of a mind
This love's, one of a kind
You and I
We're drifting
Over the edge

[Chorus]
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

[Verse 2]
You and I
We're learning to speak
With kisses on cheeks
You and I
We're lifted
Over the edge

[Chorus]
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?


[Outro]
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?

In hotel rooms far away from home
I miss you, more than you will know

Shine a light
Just one side
To think again
That your mine
It's high time
I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

Oh I need you, without you I'll fall apart
And last winter, I need you to feed my heart

But all the night
Sky blue
Stars are bright
Shine through
Like you
And I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

[Verse 1]
Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak, open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changing our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feeling your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You (Yeah) are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Yeah)
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you


[Verse 2]
Fast forward a couple years, yeah
Grown up in the place that we live
Make love, then we fight
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night, baby
I guess we can't control
What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You (Yeah) are bringing out a different kind of me (Ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you (Ooh)
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you


[Bridge]
Every time I see you, baby, I get lost
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
Every night I'm with you, I fall more in love
Now I'm laying by your side
Everything feels right since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You, yeah, are bringing out a different kind of me (Ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you (Ooh)
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in...



[Verse 1]
You and I, two of a mind
This love's one of a kind
You and I, we're drifting
Over the edge

[Chorus]
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?

[Verse 2]
You and I learning to speak
With kisses on cheek
You and I we're drifting over the edge

[Chorus]
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?

[Chorus]
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?

[Outro]
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?


[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Hmm, let me go
To see my family
Please, Father, let me go
As my mother sleeps

[Verse 1: P Money]
I don't know about James bond
But round here nobody lives twice
When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye
Cause only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me, I nearly lost my life
3 weeks after I got this ride
Pissed like I had way too much wine
Wished I didn't get one
Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set
Even though I didn't have a set one
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
20 minutes later I was on the M1
Tired, but I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No motion in my face
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going
Woke up, lorry, flash
Panic, break, skid, crash
Skidded more, bang, smash
Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a Megane that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled, didn't even know my name
Fainted, too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again

[Hook: P Money & Ed Sheeran]
See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out
Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared
And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please, Father, let me go
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps

[Verse 2: P Money]
Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open
I could hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning
One of the worst situations I've been in
I could hear all of the angels singing
But when they stopped humming
My brain turned on, started running
Still in pain, but it started numbing
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly)
Ever so cunning
6 weeks later, jogging and running
I used the first aid kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes
You can't afford to let one in
Never done tunes for a while
The pipeline was blocked
So I learned and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But they forgot to tell you, you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show
Thinking "I just wanna see my brother"
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up


[Hook]

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul



[Intro: Young Thug]
Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real (You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Jump into the crowd, leave your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no nothin'
Gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real
(You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

[Verse 2: J Hus]
Used to be Playboy heartbreaker
But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (Alright)
One day, we'll get married in Las Vegas (Nah)
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin (Alright)
This love give you protein and vitamin (Yeah)
See you wigglin', jigglin' (Mmm)
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? (One)
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever really seen
And you give me this feel if you know what I mean

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Feels, yeah
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
I waited most my life for somethin' real
Baby, I got the feels for ya


**FINGERTIPS**

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
The rain won't stop falling
It's harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Amy Wadge]
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you
Call
If you want me when you

[Verse 2 Ed Sheeran & Amy Wadge]
We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework, dodging classes
To set off fire alarms

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Amy Wadge]
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call

What I need to know

[Verse 1]
I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew your heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars, if it helps you sleep

[Pre-Hook]
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

[Hook]
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

[Verse 2]
Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down
It's too cold in this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one to help me get to sleep


[Pre-Hook]
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

[Hook]
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

[Bridge]
It's only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
Only been one night of love
Maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

[Hook]
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

[Verse 1: Jamie Oliver]
My name is Jamie Oliver, I'm here to say
I wanna talk about Food Revolution Day
Half the world is starving with too little to eat
And the other half die from being obese
How people live the longest is they grow and they cook
Learn recipes from your parents or books
If you haven't got a clue about the mess that we're in
The answer lies here in the words that we sing

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & Jazzie B]
Revolution
Feed the kids right through their stomach and minds
Revolution
They deserve a better future but some people are blind
It's a revolution
Educate the nation with a song and a vision
Revolution
Come on everybody, do the right thing, sign the petition

[Verse 2: Alesha Dixon & Hugh Jackman]
People in charge aren't getting it right
Politicians don't know and now they need to shed light
Don't rely on the government to fix this plight
No country in the world has ever won this fight
We're the only ones who can save our lives
Click the link below for the petition to sign
It doesn't take time so you need to just bear it
Do the right thing, sign it, share it

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, Professor Green, Alesha Dixon & Hugh Jackman]
Revolution
Feed the kids right through their stomach and minds
Revolution
They deserve a better future but some people are blind
It's a revolution
Educate the nation with a song and a vision
Revolution
Come on everybody, do the right thing, sign the petition

[Verse 3: George The Poet]
Yeah, we all have a friend
Someone who's there from the start to the end
Someone who's there through the good times and the worse of it too
And guess what? That person is you
So from now on when you wake up, first thing you do
Make yourself a promise that you'll eat better food
We better do what we can, this better reach somebody
Why? Cause you only get one body

[Bridge: Professor Green & Jazzie B]
Don't give up your day job, Jamie
I'm only joking, mate
It's all for a good cause
We need a revolution, not devolution
Think of bad nutrition
This is a revolution
People, can you see? Come on now

[Chorus]
Revolution
Feed the kids right through their stomach and minds
Revolution
They deserve a better future but some people are blind
It's a revolution
Educate the nation with a song and a vision
Revolution
Come on everybody, do the right thing, sign the petition

[Chorus]
Revolution
Feed the kids right through their stomach and minds
Revolution
They deserve a better future but some people are blind
It's a revolution
Educate the nation with a song and a vision
Revolution
Come on everybody, do the right thing, sign the petition


(intro)

Ooooh darlin' (x4)

Its 4AM beneath the stars under the night,
and you're here, and you're here.

With candles lit the room is dark the moon is light,
we can lay here, we can love here...

(Chorus)

Forever,

so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.

Ooooh darlin' (x2)

(Verse 2)

I bought some food, a change of clothes, a little wine,
and a blanket,
and we used them all...


I dreamt the day away on a planet full of life,
and just stayed there,
i fell in love there.

(Chorus)

Perfect comes near,
perfect just for one,
and forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.

Ooooh darlin' (x2)

We're lying down her cheek is resting on my shoulder,

(Chorus)

Love knows no fear,
Father doubted some,
forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.


Ooooh darlin' (x2)


[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
She's got that street flow, I still wanna hit it slow
She's got that heat on hold, bend the weed I smoke
Know she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?

[Verse 1: The Game]
I tell her, "Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah"
Said she twerkin' for tuition, gon' do that, do that to that 2Pac, 2Pac

Bad boy in the pussy, I'm a bring MaSe back
Horse and carriage, Diddy, what it take?

Rich nigga shit, ri-rich nigga shit
Stop playin' wit' them lames, be a rich nigga bitch
Tom Ford denim, see the grip when I sit
That boy spit venom, make a nun turn tricks
No teeth, just tongue and some lips wit' the shit
Mustard on the beat, but it's some Ritz in this bitch

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Lil Dicky, ooh
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I woke up Chris Breezy, oh my god I'm the man (oh shit)
I'm so fly and I can dance (whoa, whoa shit)
There's tattoos on my neck (oh, oh)
I just FaceTimed Kanye (blip, blip)
I told him I'm his biggest fan, yeah (yeah)
Got all these hoes in my DM (yeah, I do)
Holy shit, I got a kid (oh)
Ohh, I can sing so well

Wait, can I really say the n-word?

Big ups, my nigga, we up, my nigga
You pussy ass nigga, man, fuck y'all niggas
'Cause I'm that nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I woke up in Chris Brown's body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday
Yeah, it's Freaky Friday
I'm in Chris Brown's body
I drive his Ferrari and I'm light-skinned black


[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
(Ring ring) What the fuck?
I woke up and I'm Lil Dicky (Lil Dicky?)
Ugh, what the fuck?
This shit is real weak
How his dick staying perched up on his balls like that?
Walking down the street and ain't nobody know my name (whoa)
Ain't no paparazzi flashing pictures, this is great (whoa)
Ain't nobody judging 'cause I'm black or my controversial past
I'ma go and see a movie and relax (woo)
Ayy, I'm a Blood but I can finally wear blue (cool)
Why his momma calling all the time?
Leave me the fuck alone, bitch
Wait, if I'm in Dicky's body, Breezy is who?
Hope my daughter's in school
Fuck, if I was Chris Brown, where would I be?
What would I do?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I woke up in Chris Brown's body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday
Yeah, it's Freaky Friday
I'm in Chris Brown's body
I look at my soft dick with delight, it's my dream dick


[Verse 3: Lil Dicky & Chris Brown]
If I was Lil Dicky in my body, where would I be?
I'm tryna to find myself like an introspective monk
I'm balling on the court, oh my god I can dunk
Snap a flick of my junk
My dick is trending on Twitter? Fuck
Now I'm at the club, I talked my way into getting in
I look up in the VIP, my goodness there I am
I signal to him to let me in but he won't let me in
I don't know who that is
Wait, who the fuck he think he is?
Took a glass bottle, shatter it on the bouncer's head (woo)
Walked up to that motherfucker
Wait, think it through for a sec
If you hurting me then you only hurting yourself
But wait, I love myself
That was the key, now we're switching back

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I woke up in Chris Brown's body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways
(I can't believe)
I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday

[Outro]
Lil Dicky: Wait, what the fuck?
Ed Sheeran: And now I'm in Ed Sheeran's body
It's way less cool than being Chris Brown was
Lil Dicky: What the fuck again?
DJ Khaled: I'm DJ Khaled
Why am I yelling?
Kendall Jenner: Huh, I'm Kendall Jenner
I got a vagina, I'm gonna explore that right now (woo, woo)
Holy shit, I got a vagina (uh), I'm gonna learn
I'm gonna understand the inner workings of a woman




[Verse 1]
We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?
And heaven knows, no one wants it to

[Pre-Chorus]
So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

[Chorus 1]
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

[Verse 2]
We're not friends, we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
They'll never know what we've been through

[Pre-Chorus]
So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

[Chorus 1]
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

[Bridge]
But then again, if we're not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again, if we're not friends
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why

[Chorus 2]
Friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
And I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you do
Oh, my friends will never love me like you


I'm so tired today
Was meant to catch that train
From Fulham Broadway but I missed it
And I rang you up to check how you've done
And your eyes shine like gold from the sun to me
And I hear that you have messed it all up again
I'll be right there to catch you
Like I'm gonna catch this train
And I'll always be here you know
I will love your smile and love your way
As long as you can let it show
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don't give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in the crossfire
All that I can say
Is I'll walk away
It's a game they play
If I'm shot down in the crossfire
I can't wait
And she can't drive yet
But she can drive me to a point of mental craze
And she will wind me up
She's the sort of girl that keeps you hanging on and on for days
And I
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don't give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in a crossfire
All that I can say
Is I'll walk away
It's a game they play
If I'm shot down in the crossfire
I can't wait
Broken hearted
I've departed
To a place I feel more comfortable
And I belong here
Don't shed no tear
Just remember I'll be back again
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don't give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in the crossfire
All that I can say
Is I'll walk away
Its a game they play
If I'm shot down in the crossfire
I'm so tired today
Was meant to catch that train
From Fulham Broadway but I missed it



[Verse]
Last week that I have fewer idea
Love it so hard I have a lot more
Last week that I have fewer idea
Love it so hard I have a lot more

[Pre-Chorus]
Just saw this tweet with a new bird
And the only your phone in a row
I'm in a statement from his owners

[Chorus]
He is only pretending to have more
How to do that in my head hurts so bad
She was likely to be the best way to go
To give a shout out to my future's lad

[Bridge]
Where the future's lad




[Chorus]
He played the fiddle in an Irish band
But he fell in love with an English gal
I Kissed him on the neck and then I took him by the hand
Said, "Honey, I just want to dance"

[Verse 1]
I met him on Grafton street right outside of the bar
He shared a cigarette with me while his brother played the guitar
He asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
He took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
He got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, he played the fiddle in an Irish band
But he fell in love with an English gal
I Kissed him on the neck and then I took him by the hand
Said, "Honey, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Boy
You're my pretty little Galway Boy

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then he beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the ceili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, he played the fiddle in an Irish band
But he fell in love with an English gal
I Kissed him on the neck and then I took him by the hand
Said, "Honey, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Boy
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Boy
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Boy
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Boy

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding his hand, his hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked him home then he took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Boy and a perfect night

[Chorus]
You know, he played the fiddle in an Irish band
But he fell in love with an English gal
I Kissed him on the neck and then I took him by the hand
Said, "Honey, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Boy
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Boy
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Boy
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Boy




[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar

But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me "what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?"
Said "it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?"
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Ceilidh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know


[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my, Galway girl
My my my my my my my, Galway girl
My my my my my my my, Galway girl

[Verse 3]
Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
Kissed her on the cheek and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the store
She sang a song and taught me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me, "What does it mean, the Gaelic thing on your arm?"
Said, "It was one of my friend's songs, do you want to sing on?"
She took me out to a party just for the fun
We were singing at the table with our friends all singing along
Chatted some more, one more song on guitar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know?

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
Kissed her on the cheek and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway girl
You're my pretty little Galway girl (Hey)

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And she looked at me like there was nobody else in the room
As song titles were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the ceili, singing to trad tunes
I never heard "Carrickfergus" ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the back using her feet for a beat
Oh, I can have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know?


[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
Kissed her on the cheek and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl (Hey)

[Chorus]
You know she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
Kissed her on the cheek and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl (Hey)

[Outro]
Oh

She played the fiddle in an Irish band

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

[Letra de "Give Me Love"]

[Estrofa 1]
Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Give a little time to me (give a little time to me)
We'll play hide and seek (we'll play hide and seek)
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me love
Give me love

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
My my, my my
Give me love
My my, my my
Give me love
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me love

[Break: Ed Sheeran]
Love me, love me, love me
Give me love, give me love

[Verse 2: Mic Righteous]
As youths we used to play games
Like hide and seek and Simon Says
And then we realized we're not mice, we're men
And that was kinda dead
For one more time, let's play Simon Says
But this time, it's not Simon, 'cause Simon's Ed
Give me love like it meant life or death
Like it meant your final breath, yeah
Give me love like you could buy it from the corner shop
You could spend your time, so it don't matter if you're poor or not
Give me that real love, something you could feel, love
Maybe it could heal ya, just like the first time you said it
Give me love cause hate is the worst kind of weapon
It's like I finally see the person in my reflection
Check


[Hook: Ed Sheeran]

[Speaking over hook: Mic Righteous]
Give me love like there was love to give
And if it does exist, well
Yeah give me love like there was love to give
I be wondering if love exists and if it does then give me some yo give me love
Give me love, say give me love, give me love, yeah

[Outro: Ed Sheeran & (Mic Righteous)]
Oh, I just wanna hold ya
(Give me love like there was love to give
And if it does exist, well)
Give me love
Love me, love me, love me
Give me love, give me love

On a late night
We were outside
Of a club near Brixton station
Rolled one line
Come and smoke my weed baby



[Hook]
My my, give me love

[Verse 1]
I wish we could be as happy
As lovers in the movies
Like yonce and Jay Z
Or the golden aged Kennedys
Things for us were simple
Ya things for us were easy
We shared our love freely
Like Kim K and yeezy
She had me going crazy
Upstairs in her apartment
I had her locked in my heart
A secret compartment
Told her I'd be there
Told her I wouldn't leave
She was my life
But then she went and got greedy
Two guys in three days
What do you think that says
When I provided for her
But she goes and sleeps it all away
Our whole life together
I don't know what to say
Like baby come back
Or like baby get the fuck away

[Hook]
My my, give me love

[Verse 2]
Tears flowed down her face
And the same went for me
I tried to keep calm
But I couldn't believe she did it to me
Like more than a year together
We battled stormy weather
As cliche as it sounds
I thought we had it locked forever
I asked for her love
And she gave me so much more
But then she took it all away
And thats when I fell for it
Just another broken heart
That won't soon be replaced
By someone elses love
Or another beautiful face

[Hook]
My my, give me love




The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you




[Verse 1]
Smoke alarm went off at nine
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note "I'll be back in 5"
Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

[Chorus]
But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved

[Verse 2]
I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

[Chorus]
But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved

[Chorus - Repeated]
But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved




[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Hey, can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know, hmm

[Verse 1: Dot Rotten]
I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you

[Hook 1: Ed Sheeran (Dot Rotten)]
And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh

[Verse 2: Dot Rotten]
I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you "Nan can I go out?"
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you

[Hook 1]
And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran]
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you

[Verse 4: Dot Rotten]
There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me

[Hook 2: Ed Sheeran]
I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you?


[Verse 1]
My mind is a warrior, my heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the color of red like a sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart, not a follower, we're not done yet now

[Pre-Chorus]
I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh, I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

[Chorus]
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, down


[Verse 2]
My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest against
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again

[Pre-Chorus]
I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh, I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

[Chorus]
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down


[Bridge]
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down

[Chorus]
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down



My mind is a warrior
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the colour of red like the sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up
And left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart not a follower
We're not done yet
And i see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so ill know
That ill never let you down
I'll never let you down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down

My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
Your chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest
Again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again
Now I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh I'll never let you down
We'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so ill know
That I'll never let you down
I'll l never let you down

Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down

Cus your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade

But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down




Fell out of love with her
Just to trip straight back in
Times like this don't come round here
And chances are slim

But eventually
You'll be mine

Love stole my sympathy
When she belonged to him
But now I will feel the soft touch of her lips again
But chances are slim

But eventually
You'll be mine
I won't miss a thing
If you're mine

I don't care if you're lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that

All I see, is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can't fix this

Love
It won't grow back
She said it's time for a quick cigarette by the bike shed
She asked me if I'd regret it all and I said
I replied no love this about as far as it goes
See me going by the thought of you and it shows
She said you weren't even listening
I might be too much right now man it's sickening
Can't believe I'm running from her
I'm stranded, her beauty is too much to bear
And oh I think I want her
And oh I swear she's never been deep in before
And oh I think I need her
I can't tell her I want her it's not right in summer
I think that I need her

I won't miss a thing
If you're mine
I don't care if you're lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that

All I see is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can't fix this
All I see is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can't fix this

Love, it won't grow back
Your love hit me like a punch in the nose
Baby your love deals the hardest blows


[Verse 1: Macklemore]
They say boys don't cry
But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Give back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest "A Raisin in the Sun"
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change


[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know
But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I recommend that you read "The Alchemist"
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up
Do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance


[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know
But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
I'm still growing up
I'm still growing up, ooh
I'm still growing up
I'm still growing up

[Verse 1: Foy Vance]
Well the road is wide
Waters run on either side
And my shadow in the fading light
Is stretching out towards the night
Cause the sun is low
And I yet have still so far to go
And my lonely heart is beating so
Tired of the wonder
There's a sign ahead
Though I think it's the same one again
But I'm thinking 'bout my only friend
So I find my way home

[Chorus: Foy Vance]
Cause when I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, well the air is cold
And yonder lies my sleeping soul
By the branches broke like bones
This weakened tree no longer holds
Well, the night is still
And I have not yet lost my will
Oh,  and I will keep on moving 'till
I find my way home


[Chorus: Foy Vance]
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light

[Chorus: Foy Vance]
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light

[Chorus: Foy Vance]
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light

[Outro: Foy Vance]
So lead me up, and leave me strong
Like the road I walk on
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light



[Verse 1]
Well the road is wide
Waters run on either side
And my shadow in the fading light
Is stretching out towards the night
When the sun is low
And I have so much more to go
And my lonely heart is beating so
Tired of the wonder
There's a sign ahead
Though I think it's the same one again
So I'm thinking 'bout my only friend
Till I find my way home

[Chorus]
Cause when I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light

[Verse 2]
Oh, well the air is cold
And yonder lies my sleeping soul
By the branches broke like bones
This weeping tree no longer holds
Oh well, the night is still
And I have not yet lost my will
Oh, and I will keep on moving 'till
Until I find my way home

[Chorus]
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light


I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a god above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You said I took the name in vain
Well, I never really knew that name
But if I did, what really is it to you?
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not some victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Chorus]
He rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the winds and the steppes and the cobble
He rode to a woman's side
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
And a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss

[Refrain]
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm

[Verse 1]
And there he stood with sword in hand
The Last of Darry's ten
And red the grass beneath his feet
And red his banner's bright
And red the glow of the setting sun that bathe him in its light
"Come one, come on", the great lord called, "my sword is hungry still"
And with the cry of savage rage they swarmed across the rill
And with the cry of savage rage they swarmed across the rill


[Chorus]
He rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the winds and the steppes and the cobble
He rode to a woman's side
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
For a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss

[Refrain]
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm (x4)



[Verse]
He rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobble
He rode to a woman's sigh
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
And a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss

[Refrain]
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are ...


[Part]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you


[Bridge]
Come on, be my baby, come on

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 1]
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

[Pre-Chrous]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Verse 2]
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

[Chorus 2]
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Outro]
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you

[Verse 1]
Walking down 29th and park

[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

[Chorus 1]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Hey yeah hey yeah hey yeah*2

[Verse 1]
She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

[Chorus]
That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know

[Chorus]
But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

[Chorus]
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Part I: Don't Forget to Breathe]

[Chorus: Stormzy]
You just chase your dreams
You don't even take the time to sleep
But don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to breathe (Don't forget to breathe)
You just chase your dreams
You don't even take the time to sleep
But don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to breathe (Breathe)
You just chase your dreams (Oh, oh)
You don't even take the time to sleep
(You don't even take the time to sleep)
But don't forget to breathe

Let it breathe, yo (Oh, yeah)
Let it breathe (Oh, yeah)
One time, let it breathe (Oh, yeah)
(Oh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
If I can do better then I'll be better
Rolling in the deep, I need to breathe better
I see demons in my sleep, I need to sleep better
Having visions of my friends in RIP sweaters
Have you ever had to sacrifice your health?
Ever had to sacrifice yourself?
Plus I got an army full of fools tryna sabotage my wealth
But I know it's self-destructive if I bang 'em by myself, wow
Like, God hold me down 'til I'm downed
God, hold me down 'til I drown (Hold me down 'til I drown)
It's like I nearly fell into the ground
But the holy blood of Christ, you don't ever let me down
Lord knows I'll be back up in minutes and disappear
Wonder if I flip, all my mandem just disappear
Number seventeen on my little list of fears
Then she tells me not to speak and she whispers in my ear like

[Chorus]
I know everything is okay (Okay)
But I'ma need you to do better (Better)
I'ma need you to do better (Better)
I'ma need you to do better (Better)
I know everything is okay (Okay)
But I'ma need you to do better (Better)

[Part III: Wiley Flow]

[Verse 1]
If you can't do 10K first week, then I don't wanna hear no chat about numbers
You man are my youngers, all blacked out like grungers
Tens and twenties and hundreds
Tens and twenties and thousands, uh
I can't never just lowe dem, no
On Mount Everest shoutin', "Ah"
Soon go back to the mountains; third album
Brother, I bless the beat with smoke
And my day one bros, they kept me close
Then I sip my Tetley, take a toke
They're tryna get me on the ropes
Ayy, bro got the speshy in his coat
So, please, man, let's just be adults
And don't be flexin' in my boat
Brother, you can't test me, I'm the G.O.A.T

Rolex collections lookin' dope, I got the Pepsi and the Hulk
And I ain't flexin' on you, brothers, cah I'll still be sexy, if I'm broke

[Chorus]
Wait there, -made to win, -designed to blow
-doin' major things, it's a minor though
Used to pay for things, but that was time ago
-hit you brothers with the Wiley flow, it's like

[Verse 2]
Bad 'em up, bad 'em up, bad 'em up once
Never could you take me for a dance
Been on the scene for a hundred months, all I met is bare punts
Take man for lunch, idiot youts get punched
Pick one boy from your bunch
Tell man, "Jump!", oh, what, you didn't wanna jump? Well
Oh, well, look, now you're slumped
Lil' brother, I swerve (Ah) (Lil' brother, I swerve)
Get out my lane (Get out my lane)
North and East and West are hot, but the South's on flames
This year, I'ma be a household name
I grew up in a house of pain
I don't do it for the clout or fame
All the real brothers gonna vouch on my name
All the real brothers gonna vouch on my (Vouch on my)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
If you can't sell out three O2's, then I don't wanna hear no chat about-
Nah, I'm joking, man

Girl, I felt your presence when they let you through the door (Door)

Lord, let the rain fall on my enemies
Let it fall on my enemies


[Intro: Big Narstie]
Hello Hi Remix
Ed Sheeran
Big Narstie
Bass

[Bridge: Big Narstie]
Alright there, love? (Alright there, love?)
You know you're looking real buff (You know you're looking real buff)
I know I'm not supposed to touch (I know I'm not supposed to touch)
But baby, we should turn up (Turn up)

[Chorus: Big Narstie]
Base
Hello baby, hello baby, hi (Hi)
Hello baby, hello baby, hi
Hello baby, hello baby, hi (Hello)
Hello, baby, hi
Hello, ohoi, caio
Ni hao, bonjour, caio
Guten tag, konnichiwa, it is going down (Down)
Bass, ow

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm using jumpers for goal posts, cigarettes for don't cope
Mum's sayin' "don't smoke", though I don't listen
I got love for a ghost note and shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in a hard time and words that aren't mine
Trying to find a love with a compatible star sign
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm trying to find mine
Shit, quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen?
Just let me hit the studio and I'ma rip it again
Yep, yeah, I'm a dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me "work hard, and you can never be shit"
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Sat back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had, yep
Now I don't even wanna rap no more, plus
I lost weight, yeah, I ain't fat no more
I can now afford things that I couldn't before
Not on the sofa in a basement flat no more, I'm
One of one, I still sing with the crowd
Now the people understand what I'm singing about
I'm not the type of lad who waits, sitting around
So when I'm done with my spot, I'm takin' your crown
Not gonna have a lie down when the vibe's out
By now, whenever I'm round, it's lights out
Hello, hi now, Narstie's here to wile out
We're recording the tune right here at my house
It's been a while and we finally did it
I told him that I'd spin him but he'd never admit it
His family cooks food and treats me well
That's why I'm on the tune sayin' "BDL"


[Chorus: Big Narstie]
Bass
Hello baby, hello baby, hi (Hi)
Hello baby, hello baby, hi
Hello baby, hello baby, hi (Hello)
Hello, baby, hi
Hello, ahoy, ciao
Ni hao, bonjour, ciao
Guten tag, konnichiwa, it is going down (Down)
Bass, ow

[Verse 2: Big Narstie]
Shell a man's face off now, Nokia face off style
Raging bull from the days of school, had ambitions to get paid in full
Check me now, I'm a hundred thou', zookeeper in the fucking town
Hello baby, hello baby, hi
Who's on a million now?
Gone for a minute but I'm back with a smile
Chain freeze and I'm gleaming with style
They were gone for a yard but I'm gone for a mile
My attitude's vile, I'm the guy who's influencing your kids (Yeah)
AKA or base
People get the face, you're waste, you're not in my space
You're bland, you ain't got enough taste, I swear
I'm still in this race, I'm here
Make room, give me space
This year, the fat kid's gonna tear
You fucking dun know
So hello, baby, hi
Man put Ed on a tune with an intergalactic vibe
Reach for the skies, base


[Pre-Chorus: Big Narstie]
Hello, baby, hello, baby, hello baby, hi
Hella lifted, hella twisted, I am hella high
L'oreal, all these ladies know I am worth
When I put Ed on the remix even Charlie Sloth said perfect

[Chorus: Big Narstie]
Hello baby, hello baby, hi (Hi)
Hello baby, hello baby
Hello baby, hello baby, hi (Hello)
Hello, baby, hi (Hello)
Hello baby, hello baby, hi (Hi)
Hello baby, hello baby
Hello baby, hello baby, hi (Hello)
Hello, baby, hi

[Verse 1]
No one knows 'bout the things that I've been through with you
There were times I'd drive you nearly mental
But when you're mad, you're still beautiful
And I know that I'm punching way above
So lucky that we fell in love
Sometimes I wonder am I enough?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I

[Chorus]
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me

[Verse 2]
No one knows 'bout all the good things you do
When people take advantage of you
Your heart is pure and so beautiful
And I know that it's just the way you are
Father's eyes, but mother's daughter
And you tell me that you don't give enough


[Pre-Chorus]
And now I found someone with all the boxes that I want ticked
'Cause your love is all I ever wanted
Set my heart on fire, I needed something
This is all I wanted to be, you and I

[Chorus]
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me

[Bridge]
'Cause you could have someone without a belly or a temper
Perfect teeth, hair growing where it's meant to
You know my lips are all I can hold against you
This is all that I'll ever need, you and I, you and I

[Chorus]
Hello, my love
I've been searching for someone like you
For most my life
Happiness ain't a thing I'm used to
You could have fallen hard for anyone (Anyone)
Plenty of fish in the sea, hey now
For all of time, now I know
It's just my angel and me

[Verse 1:]
It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on

[Chorus:]
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

[Verse 2:]
It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say
That that's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today
Hold on


[Chorus 2x:]
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold on

[Verse 1: Fugative]
It's like they've got me locked up, shackles no keys
They want me to play the game but the game right now ain't playing with me
So keeping my cool, keep on searching
Not singing much, I keep on working
Cause I know they know this time round I won't be hurting
I open my eyes and now I can see
Everyone I talk to they seem to agree
Like this ain't the place where you need to be
That's why I'm taking it over seas
Overseas, with no other place than disbelieve
So the minute I'm out of this place, there's no going back
Take it from me

[Hook: Ed Sheeran & Fugative]
I keep on searching for my ticket out of here
But I foul myself when my destination disappears
The road is long I'm hoping you can take me home
And then I do it again

Can't seem to make up my mind gotta leave this path behind

And I'll find my way back home
And then I do it again

Can't seem to make up my mind gotta leave this path behind


And I'll find my way back home
And I'll find my way back home

[Verse 2: Sway]
Sway!
I got the hard drive but it's backing up
Talk about the Zit but I can back it up
See call the politics you better had enough
But you were never going with the wind I had to draft
I thought a new plan you at the beginning of the path
Let me set the record straight cause when I hit the decks they be cracking up
I'm not a one trick pony but you can set it up
Cause I'm bringing it home they say
Who's they king of the thrown if it ain't Sway?
My boy F telling them to make way
Fugative now listen to what they say
Cause they hate when you work late
Real artist Van Gough-ish
That's the reason why you brush them off
Cause it's an effed up picture that they paint ay ay

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fugative]
Cheer, still her but behind bars the whole sky's talking but no stars
Along the way I had so many chances, now I got the keys but no cars
To many tracks and not enough dough to many fans that won't let go
In my mind it's only round the corner but how many times can you do the same show?
Blowing up slow with a long lit fuse
Waiting around you don't need to approve
This is my life -- I do what I do. Let's take a walk step in my shoes
Yea step in my shoes and carry this journey and picture my views
I'm taking it back to how it should be
Cause this time round I ain't gonna lose


[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt
On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

[Chorus]
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah

[Verse 2]
And now I'm sitting on a night bus, flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to UNI
People see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

[Chorus]
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah

[Bridge]
When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate who wants to be my duvet, yeah

[Chorus]
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah




[Verse 1]

[Bridge]
When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet?

[Interlude]
So this is the part where everyone gets a bit involved and uh... I introduce myself. My name is Ed Sheeran and it's a pleasure to be here. Who's up for singing a bit, yeah? The lyrics are "It's not a homeless life for me / It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be" That's a little bit of a sing-song right now

[Outro]
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

Thank you!

[Verse 1]
I can see it coming round full circle my friend
On the TV they said they had reported you dead
It was my fault cause I could've sworn that you said
It was easy to find another for your bed

[Pre-Chorus]
How does it feel to leave me this way
When all that you have's been lost in a day?
Everyone knows, but not what to say
I've been wonderin' now

[Chorus]
I've been staring at the hotel ceiling
Drinking everything I've found this evening
Trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this
I'm trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely now

[Verse 2]
When my eyes open morning pulls me into the view, no
I guess I'm only acting in the way that you do
Just being alone, no
Only time tells me more than I hope, all that I know is
I'll be finding a fortnight alone and behold
I know I shouldn't have let you go

[Chorus]
I've been staring at the hotel ceiling
Drinking everything I've found this evening
Trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this
I'm trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely now

[Outro]
I can see it coming round full circle, my friend
On the TV they said they had reported you dead


[Verse 1]
You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Verse 2]
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you


[Pre-Chorus]
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Guitar Solo: John Mayer]

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too



[Into: Wretch 32]
Hush little baby don't you cry
I said hush little baby don't you cry
I said hush little baby don't you cry
I said hush little baby don't you cry

[Verse 1: Wretch 32]
I'm saying hush little baby don't you cry
Daddy ain't sure if he can raise you right
I ain't even good with saving my money
Why should I think I can save your life?
And the whole family's gonna think I'm a devil, I don't wanna see my angels eyes
I say this with one hand on my heart, guilt ain't gonna make me change my mind
My first thoughts, were the worst thoughts, running 'round my head in circles
The worlds gonna hate me for saying this, but patience is a virtue
So we don't have to rush for our first youth, we can take time do rehearsals
And I ain't acting this is personal, and I ain't doing this just to hurt you

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I should say goodbye, before I say hello
So darling hold me, closely, tonight
Because if you open your eyes, I'll never let you go
Moving slowly, we'll both sleep tonight
And we'll just be dreaming 'til you wake me up

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
When I'm telling her about raving
She's telling me about cravings
I want her to just get the message
I don't wanna have to be so blatant
So I told her my life ain't balanced
Yeah, said the time ain't right
She said god's clock's the only one that matters
And it's about time I tried, yeah and if I listen to my family
Then they'll be a new addition to my family
I can't help feeling peer pressured, everybody's looking down but they don't understand me
And everyone's so suggestive, I'm getting mixed messages, but nobody's rang me
Huh, I'm saying this ain't a game, but I say the wrong thing and everyone wants to hang me

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I should say goodbye, before I say hello
So darling hold me, closely, tonight
Because if you open your eyes, I'll never let you go
Moving slowly, we'll both sleep tonight
And we'll just be dreaming 'til you wake me up

[Bridge: Wretch 32]
Hush little baby don't you cry
I said hush little baby don't you cry
I said hush little baby don't you cry, no
I said hush little baby don't you cry

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I should say goodbye, before I say hello
So darling hold me, closely, tonight
Because if you open your eyes, I'll never let you go
Moving slowly, we'll both sleep tonight
And we'll just be dreaming 'til you wake me up


I found the words to say how I feel
But I just can't spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That I'm a different man with a different tune
I didn't find love until last June
But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
'Cos I need something, anything to replace you
Or something close

We were inseparable
Everything I had to do I did it next to you
And the memories we made were so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby
You got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
OO you got used to being on your own

I saw it happening
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could have divided my time, I should have fractioned it

But there was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby
You got used to


Being alone, alone, (All alone)
You adapted (You adapted), now your use to
Being alone, all alone (didn't mean to leave you lonely girl)
OO you got used too being (Used to) on your own
(All on your own)



[Verse 1: Christina]
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Oh, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

[Pre-Chorus: Amy]
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Mmm, yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody
Who wants to fit in anyway?

[Chorus: Lisa]
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Dani]
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

[Pre-Chorus: Amy]
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry
But now I think that we should stay

Kiss your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back

You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (No)


[Break: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause I don't care
'Cause I don't care
'Cause I don't care
'Cause I don't care

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause I don't care
When I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh



[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Break: Ed Sheeran]
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Justin Bieber]
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (No)

[Break: Ed Sheeran]
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care




[Rye]
I don't care
And it feels so freaking good to say I swear
That I don't care

[Andy, with Rye]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
And I wanna feel the heat with somebody

[Jack & Sonny]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
(Hold up)
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time

[Sonny & All]
If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

[Brooklyn]
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

[Jack & All]
But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera

[Rye, with Jack, Andy, & Brooklyn]
And when you smile (When you smile)
The whole world (stops and stares for a while)
'Cause you're amazing ('Cause you're amazing)
Just the way you are
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Andy & All]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
(Oh, oh)

[Rye]
'Cause I don't care

[Sonny]
If you see me walking on by
Don't be afraid to say hello
Don't be a girl I used to know

[Rye]
'Cause I don't care

[Brooklyn]
And if you see my head hanging low
Sat in a place we used to go
Looking at polaroids before you were a stranger

[All]
Oh-ah-oh-ah
Your sex is on fire
So high, so high

[Rye]
But you put on quite a show
Really had me goin'
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin'

[Sonny & All]
'Cause I'm a creep (Hello, hello, hello, how low?)
I'm a weirdo (Hello, hello, hello, how low?)

[Brooklyn & All]
You are the dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

[Andy]
And she will be loved, and she will be loved

[Sonny]
I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

[Brooklyn]
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon

[Jack]
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah

[Rye with All]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care, as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh




[Intro: H.E.R.]
Ayy, I waited for you all day

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Ed Sheeran]
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & H.E.R.]
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home (Yeah)
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Ed Sheeran]
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I want all of your love, your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I just want your, I just want your time)

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & H.E.R.]
You know you're my baby (You know you're my baby)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy
Why you gotta mess with my mind?
You know you're my baby (You know you're, oh)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy, you know, you know

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Ed Sheeran]
I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Yeah, I want, yeah, I want your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Time, time)

[Outro: H.E.R.]
And I love, and I love, and I love you
Yeah, I love, and I love, and I love you
And I love, and I love, and I love you
But I want your time, yeah
Want your time, time




[Verse 1]
The life I live is a fast one
But even if I'm getting whole-pies, I would halve some
Course I think im top of the sport I do bar-none
Won't change a thing and I can still have a chart run, still be a gargon
You grow up as a kid; you're looking up to your older
And then you lose respect because you see what they show ya
I wish I didn't have to be the one that they looked to
I don't condone the war that the young ones are put through
Things have changed now but I come from the hood too
People say they never see me there but im hood dude
Say the word lemon, I'll be there with the good food
Certain man you see and they are not in a good mood
I just let the world go by and I'll pace it
If I draw a good picture then another can trace it
Mother dropped me in the world only for me to grace it
I'm gona leave my mark on this earth place it, advanced not basic

[Hook]
If I could, I would change
Life's a battle I'm only one somebody I can only do so much
And even I ain't worry but I still stay strong
I am the only one, ohh
I tell them no man is an island, well you will think we are but I'm breaking the silence

[Verse 2]
I wanna see us all on one time
But if I'm on the bill then someone gotta spit one rhyme
What they tryna do is light the show with me one sign
Can't help the world will your only one mind, only got one life
If you dont reverse and take it serious; one mic
Deny you of your legacy and they ain't got one right
Well I record a batch of nine tracks in one night
I work through the hours and then I meet with the sunlight
I know I got power but I'm tryin to channel it
I know that we can make the music, money, and manage it
Even starting from the floor I'll find the flow and unravel it
Every time I watch the news blud its making me sad a bit
I really need to change the channel over to happy vibes
N-dubz, fazer, tulisa, dappy vibes
Whoevers in the lime-light's got a good apetite
I rate ya, how am I gona hate ya? Harry right, huh

[Hook] (x2)




[Verse 1]
I'm standing on a mountain
Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone
The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget
But not yet

[Hook 1]
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
I love you

[Verse 2]
How can I tell you?
I don't know what to say
This chance that I won't miss
But I miss you anyway
I feel your pain
It's turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home
But then you came

[Hook 2]
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
Wishing my life away
These three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
I love you


[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

[Chorus]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

[Verse 2]
I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop


[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

[Chorus]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

[Bridge]
And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now? (And I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover?
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
[Outro]
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover?



[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us

[Pre-Hook]
And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

[Hook]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

[Verse 2]
I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling, now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop

[Pre-Hook 2]
And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

[Hook]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

[Outro]
And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long long I love my lover, now, now? (and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover? (feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long long I love my lover?


[Verse 1]
It's been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left for  me
All that's left is shattered hearts
It's plain enough for us to see that
You've got me
You've got me

[Hook]
We're just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It's no fuss
I'm not in love

[Verse 2]
Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You've got me
You've got me


[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I lost it in your kiss, your lips
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer's touch
It's true
I'm glad I'm not you

[Intro]
I'm in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low

[Verse 1]
Hit my plug, that's my cholo
He got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco (go crazy)
Hit you with that treinta ocho
If ya thinkin' that I'm solo
A 50 deep, I'm like, "oh, no"
I heard the feds takin' photos
Nothin', not the popo

[Hook]
I'm in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I'm in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I'm in love, I-I'm in love with the coco

[Verse 2]
30 flicks, that's a kilo
I need a brick, miss my three flow
I'm in love, just like Nino-no-no
Bustin' shots like Ne-Yo
Free my homies, not the C.O
And not the judge, not my P.O. no
All this sugar, I'm like Nino
Water whip, I'm like Nemo


[Bridge]
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
I whip it through the glass and
We're going really fast, man

[Hook]
I'm in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I'm in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I'm in love, I-I'm in love with the coco

[Outro]
Low, low, low
Low, low, low
I got it for the low, man
Low, Low, Low



I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...

Hit my plug, that's my cholo
Cause he got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco
Hit you with that treinta ocho
Niggas thinkin' that I'm solo
50 deep, they're like, "oh, no"
Heard the feds takin' photos
I know nothin', fuck the popo

I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...

36, that's a kilo
Need a brick, miss my free throw
I'm in love, just like Ne-Yo
Bustin' shots, now he Neo
Free my homies, fuck the C.O
Fuck the judge, fuck my P.O
All this coke, like I'm Nino

Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga

I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...




(Verse 1:)
Shock, horror, I'm down
Lost, you're not around
There's a lump in my chest
That sends cold through my head, and
My mind shuts sound out
I'm on auto-pilot
And my tongue's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down next to me

(Chorus:)
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you and I miss you

(Verse 2:)
These words mean nothing to me
I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching
Constrict them- suffocating
My mind is racing
With the picture I'm painting
And my belly's sick to it's stomach
When I remember all the times he was with you when you laid it down
You lay down next to me

(Chorus:)
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you

(Bridge:)
More than I let on
I kissed you
Far too long
I'll let go as soon as you do
See I know we're not through

(Chorus:)
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you, that I miss you, whoa-oh-oh-oh

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you




[Verse 1]
If you wanna put this on me, that's fine
I never blamed you for anything at all, in my life
Things we try to do won't work
So can you help me out?
Things we try to do won't work
So can you help me out?

[Hook 1]
And say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it's true
Cause I have fallen for you
Say if you love somebody new

[Verse 2]
See I wanna take her to the Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly Show
I could have taken anyone there
But I like the way she brushed her hair back
I never trust, begin to realize
How fast I would turn an eye
I was blind to all, yeah I saw all

[Hook 1 x2]

[Break]
Seeing this fake heart break
And stomach ache has got me
Acting like a pregnancy

[Hook 2]
I never fell for you, you tripped me
Cause even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind it's true, in my mind now
I never fell for you, you tripped me
Even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind now, my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me


[Verse 1]
I write this song in memory of
The wayward smile
The boy we won't forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows
The tears that we wept

[Hook]
Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that you're gone

[Verse 2]
The cheeky smile
Of jokes and laughs
The memories of times
We crossed the line
The stepping stones
Across my mind
Washed away
We all now feel so blind

[Hook]


[Outro]
Goodbye



[Verse 1]
I'm getting very edgy
Cos you're trying to take this from me
And it's something that I wanted so bad
Cos you're the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
Cos you're a jealous girl
And all I can say is
It's your fault but partially mine
For losing hope
For not treating you right
But that will disappear in time

[Pre-Chorus]
All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what's wrong
Whenever I say why?

[Chorus]
Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I'm losing sleep
I live only for the week

[Verse 2]
I've grown to ignore you
Cos when I seem to bore you
You pretend that you're not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do
But I don't care as long as you're mine
It's happening every time

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And I'm falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I can't sleep although I think I can
It's insomnia I think I have
But who cares when I'm not your man?

[Chorus]


If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the clouds roll by into the night
Well I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Burning the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
Come on!

[Intro]
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me


[Verse 3]
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Bridge]
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

[Outro]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (yeah, you know I saw a city burning)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire (don't you see it burning in the trees?)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

[Intro]
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me


[Verse 3]
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Bridge]
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

[Outro]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side



[Intro]
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Verse 3]
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Bridge]
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side


[Intro]
Woah, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn over the mountain side
Woah, yeah!

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn over the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
I see fire hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze

Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
I see fire hollowing souls
I see fire (fire), blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die

Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race, human race

[Chorus ]
When the light started out they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world

We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky (Desolation comes upon the sky)
Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn (Inside the mountain)

And I see fire
Hollowing souls

And if we should die tonight (Music's on, I'm waking up, we fight the fire)
Then we should all die together (Then we burn it up

[Intro: 2Pac]
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G

(DJ Shota)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit', tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a hoe into a housewife, baby, and there you go


[Bridge: DMX]
Can't stop, gotta eat
Stepping on, my feet
Spread love, think it's sweet
Uh, uh, uh all you catz don't know

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me


(DJ Shota)

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
A nigga never been as broke as me - I like that
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pin stripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt I'm sewing tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You want to see the inside, I see you later
Here comes the drama, oh
That's that nigga with the fake, blaow
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place
Play your position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with them, stole with them
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, butter crunch

[Verse 5: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Bridge: DMX]
Can't stop, gotta eat
Stepping on, my feet
Spread love, think it's sweet
Uh, uh, uh all you catz don't know
Can't stop, gotta eat
Stepping on, my feet
Spread love, think it's sweet
Uh, uh, uh all you catz don't know
Can't stop, gotta eat
Stepping on, my feet
Spread love, think it's sweet
Uh, uh, uh all you catz don't know
Can't stop, gotta eat
Stepping on, my feet
Spread love, think it's sweet
Uh, uh, uh all you catz don't know

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

I stole a car last night
Don't know where we're gonna go
But go ahead and drive
I will take you home
Honey, it's cold outside
And your jumper's torn
But darling, hold on tight
I will keep you warm

[Chorus]
And we will cry
'Til this fire is drowned
And we will write
All our memories down
And we will drive 'til these tyres wear out
But darling I, I will take you home

If we could drive all night
Until the sun is shown
I'll see it in your eyes, yeah
They will take me home
Honey, it's so damn bright
Daylight's taking over again
Just follow the signs
They will lead us home

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And we will drive 'til our tyres wear out
And we will write all our memories down
And we will cry 'til this fire is drowned
But darling I, I will keep you warm
Oh darling I, I will keep you warm
Darling I, I take you home




[Amy]
I always say what I'm feeling
I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out

[Dani]
I like my coffee with two sugars in it
High heels and my jewelry dripping
I, I get fired up
Insecure but I'm working with it
Many things that I could get rid of
Ain't about to give it up

[Lauren]
Made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
Broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
Momma always said 'Girl you're trouble' and
Now I wonder
Could you fall for a woman like me?

[Lisa]
And everytime we talk, boy you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending everyday with each other and still I wonder
Could you fall for a woman like me?
A woman like me

[Everyone]
Kill this love, sad but true
Kill this love, sad but true

[Katherine]
Baby, what you doing this weekend?
We can get a take away and sit on the couch
Or we could just go out for the evening
I'll give you a chance can you figure me out?

[Christina]
We must kill this love
Yeah, it's sad but true
We gotta kill this love
Before it kills you too
Kill this love
Yeah, it's sad but true
We gotta kill this love

[Lauren, Everyone]
Let's kill this love

Spending all our time with each other and still I wonder
Could you fall for a woman like me?

[Dani]
Yo, woman like me
Yes, a woman like me
Soon as he gets my eye I can tell he like me
But I'm not really looking for someone to swipe me
Boy, you caught up, and tell me would you wife me

[Lisa]
We must kill this love
Yeah, it's sad but true
We gotta kill this love
Before it kills you too
Kill this love
Yeah, it's sad but true
We gotta kill this love!

[Lauren, Christina]
Let's kill this love!

Could you fall for a woman like me?
Let's kill this love!

[Amy, Lauren]
Boy, you make me feel weak

[Ad-Libs]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

[Chorus]
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love

My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes

So I hold you close to help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
Falling in love


[Verse 1]
Knowing you, you probably got your toes in the sand
At a bar on a beach in the sun somewhere
Knowing you, you got something cold in your hand
Chatting up a stranger without a care
Knowing you, you're still wild and free
And knowing you, you're probably way over me

[Chorus]
But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you

[Verse 2]
Knowing you was a free-fall from a hundred thousand feet
When you don't even care where you land
And knowing you was the kind of rush that you feel
When you finally get to sit in with the band
And knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

[Chorus]
But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you


[Bridge]
Knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

[Chorus]
'Cause God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good
I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you

I went out late last night
And cold air met me
Lost a grip on my shoes
Walked home in bare feet

And I'll stay awake
Till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away, out

Tonight, this day won't end
The fire keep burning now

I'm never gonna leave here, tonight
I'm here again, the fire keeps burning now
I'm never gonna leave here

Let the dark cover me
And hold me tight
Hear the words in my sleep
Close your eyes for a second life within

And I'll stay awake till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away out, tonight

This day won't end, the fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight I'm here again
The fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here


Outside, in the winter, in the cold, I have not been asked where to go, and so, oh
I am here alone, waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
And day, to end, the fire is burning now

I ain't ever gonna leave here now, and I'm here again
Oh, oh I ain't ever gonna leave here

Tonight, I'm out to meet ya
Tonight, I will feel no cold
Tonight, I'll ignore that my feet hurt
And I'll be no more, without you

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close

[Verse 2: Devlin]
5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed?
It's D-E-V to the Zed
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for
To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line
Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by


[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran]
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those
That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy
Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be
On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro
Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die)


[Verse 4: Devlin]
Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information
And then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets
At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like, "Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"
What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock
And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake

[Hook]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately



I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon
Cos i know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves

I say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme
So i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cos we all recognise, real is what my father says
And i'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But i'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look
Okay, I got it
When that weight's on you, I'm gon' spot it
You need to talk, what's the topic?
I've been around the block, I got mileage
Yeah, I'll ride for you
When it gets too deep, I'll die for you
When your mama got diagnosed, I swear I almost cried for you
I wish I could turn winter into July for you
I'll July 4 it, and light up the sky
I bright up the sky like the enterprise
No need to emphasize that I'm all you need
No need to hit your ex unless it's minimized
To see the bigger picture
If you're there, I'm goin' to get you
If you're here, I'm goin' with you
Honestly, see, I could go through anything
As long as I just go there with you, straight up

And these girls so old like Coogi
On a cracked iPhone in the Louis
In the green room like she ain't no groupie
Gotta treat her like Aretha
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
These niggas try, that's comedy

[Intro: Fuse ODG]
This is, ay!
It's a worldwide movement

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I did not sleep much last night
Yeah, we were dancing to the early hours and late
And now my bed feels just right
I got my beautiful woman beside me
Sayin', sayin'
Baby, today's a lazy day
Baby, today's a lazy day
We're making love in a crazy way
Baby, today's a lazy day

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

[Bridge]
Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

(P Money)
[Verse 1]
I feel like I had plastic surgery, cause today I looked in the mirror an' realised I'm faced with neglection
Feeling like I'm in the belly of the beast, trying to get out, I don't even think it knows that it's pregnant
Stuck in the dream of deception, similar to a scene from Inception
Looking at reviews from the last show baffled, thinking "how come I didn't even get a mention?"
Shocking. I think somebody put too many plugs in my extension
I signed to music for twenty-three years, now I'm wondering why it doesn't want an extension
I'm being ignored, even the crowds just staring, I see the tension
Now I'm on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement, cause I got no reception
Ah, no bars, get it?
Now I'm choking, no bars, get it?
It turned cloudy, no stars, get it?
I hit the ground so hard, headache
Ah, it's mad
I should be proud right now but I'm sad
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad

(Ed Sheeran)
[Hook]
I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep Me Warm
I'm out of sight
With all these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December

(P Money)
[Verse 2]
Uh, my mum walks past me. my brother Prays asking why I have left them?
I didn't know I broke up with my girlfriend 'til I saw her with someone else in Beckton
(Wow)
I text her, "you dissed it". She don't reply like it's none of my business
My mind goes round in circles, it keeps on rolling, rolling more than Limp Bizkit
Why'd you do me so wicked? Something must've happened, how did I miss this?
Love turns to pain, expressed with rage. I want justice but I got no witness (help)
Now I'm powerless. Probably why I'm fascinated with Misfits
I guess I'm single, not happy, cause my heart doesn't feel like triplets
Ah, FREE, nobody understands but me
I don't think I got no-one but myself, so when I'm broke I still say "I got P"
Ah, it's mad. I should be proud right now but I'm sad
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad

(Ed Sheeran)
[Hook]
I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep Me Warm
I'm out of sight
All these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December

(P Money)
[Verse 3]
So many thoughts battle me, got me holding my head in agony
Trying to put the pieces together and figure out if this nightmare is really reality
So many turning their back on me
(wait)
It's slowly coming back to me
All I can see is the word tragedy, but I didn't think there was a fatality
Uh, damn, I think I know why I don't see my dad
I think I know why my mum walks past
And why me and my girlfriend don't chat
See, all this time I thought I was mad
I know why I'm not proud and why I'm sad
I'm out of sight and touch, cause back in March I don't think I survived that crash

(Ed Sheeran)
[Hook]
I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep me warm
I'm out of sight
With all these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December
Cold December (repeat till fade)




I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a lego house
When things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya and I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December
I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broke I'll mend ya
And keep you sheltered from
The storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now


I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

[Verse 1]
You give me life and a loss of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss

[Chorus]
So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

[Verse 2]
And you speak to me behind your darkened stare
And you let me be as if I wasn't there

[Refrain]
It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue


[Pre-Chorus]
It's you I miss
And it's you I miss, oh-oh

[Chorus]
So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

[Refrain]
It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

[Interlude]
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue


[Chorus]
So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

[Refrain]
It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

[?], baby, let's ride

Mmm, excuse me, [?], blame it on the juice and the Jager Bomb
Shot in my hand

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
I know you heard this before
I know you heard this before
It's working for sure
Gonna be hurting tomorrow
But tonight, hey hey
We're going for it (Don't judge me)
Tonight, we're going for it (Come touch me)
Tonight, we're going for it (Like you love me)
Tonight, we're going for it (Hear me out)

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
We've come to have a good time
And we won't compromise
We wanna hear the colors
We wanna feel the lights
Automatic wine
My money stacked so high
It feels like stick like Tide
Takes the smallest slice
It still touch the sky

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Tonight we're going turbo
The dance-hall is packed to the curb yo
We're gonna need a lot of merlot
But the question is where'd I just go


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you
So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
I know you heard this before
I know you heard this before
It's working for sure
Gonna be hurting tomorrow
But tonight, hey hey
We're going for it (don't judge me)
Tonight, we're going for it (come touch me)
Tonight, we're going for it (like you love me)
(All the orgasmic girls)
Tonight, we're going for it (hear me out)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
You ever seen one girl take over the night?
Take over the city and restore its pride
If you're gonna roll a blunt
Then roll a blunt right
The room is too dark
Someone spark up the light
Police, got the strap on the side
My people still fly the kite
But I learned from my grandma
To master my eye
Oh shit I'm talking too much
I'm too fucking hyped


[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Tonight we're going turbo
The dance-hall is packed to the curb yo
We're gonna eat a lot of merlot
But the question is where'd I just go

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you
So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
I know you heard this before
I know you heard this before
It's working for sure
Gonna be hurting tomorrow
But tonight, hey hey we're-

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood



[Verse 1]
If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh

[Chorus]
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird

[Verse 2]
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say it's late love, get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

[Chorus]
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird

[Bridge]
And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You make me scream, and then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die

[Chorus]
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
You're my little bird




If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when i wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, ohh

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We could lay down, so I'm next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
And if I wake up, say its late love get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon

And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird

My little bird

My little bird

And of all this thing I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You made me scream but then I made you cry when I left that little bird with its broken leg to die

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoaa

My little bird

My little bird

Your my little bird...


[Verse 1: Mikill Pane]
Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly


[Verse 2: Mikill Pane]
Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly


[Bridge]
Now an angel will die, covered in white
With losed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time now, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Verse 3: Mikill Pane]
Little lady, you're trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police in
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, "Who you working for?"
He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
He's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, "Where you been, bitch? I wanna know"
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point, your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
And we're all under the upper hand
And going mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
And fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
And angels to die



[Verse 1]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind: It was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

[Chorus]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Bridge]
You never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Chorus]
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to
I'm in love with you, and all your little things


[Verse 1: Alyssa Shouse & Jonah Marais]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the darts with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the wrinkles by your eyes
When you've smiled, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples on your back at the bottom of your spine
But I love them endlessly

[Chorus: Alyssa Shouse]
I won't let these little things 'scape out my mouth
But it's true, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

[Verse 2: Alyssa Shouse & Jonah Marais]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
You know those conversations, all the secrets that I keep
All makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice
On tape, you never watch, but I know how much you hate
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me


[Chorus: Both]
I won't let these little things 'scape out my mouth
But it's true, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

[Post-Chorus: Jonah Marais & Both]
You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right, darling, but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
And maybe you'll love yourself like I love you

[Bridge: Jonah Marais]
I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh, it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you
And all these little things

[Chorus: Alyssa Shouse & Both]
I won't let these little things 'scape out my mouth
But it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things



[Verse 1: Zayn & Liam & Both]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind: It was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn & Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis & Harry & Both]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry & Niall]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Bridge: Niall]
You never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Chorus: Harry & All]
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to
I'm in love with you, and all your little things


Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me

You never want to know how much you weigh

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if its true , it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things


You never love yourself half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to

I'm in love with you, and all your little things



[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
There wasn't much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last cheque
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette, feeling half dead
Whisky on my mind, then came the debt
Sheriff in the yard, here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by
My girl cried 'baby this'll be my last bye'
Baby in her arms, she took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave, nonchalant about it
Maybe she'll come back, this time I doubt it
Act like I care, but I really don't
Wanted to change but somehow I knew I really won't
See I'm the type of man who can't stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal
Maybe I love blood, I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a praying hand
God's not going to lend another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock, and be late again
One gun and a harley in the driveway
One way out, dirt road pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk, half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention, in fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away, and he started singing...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I didn't see it coming, I didn't see the wall
And I went from running to a slow crawl
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry
Would say I'm okay, but I'm afraid to lie
I speak no evil, but hear no angels
My family is callin', but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over, ice cold, hell's door, knock-knock,
I'm on the salt road non-stop
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot
In the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap, I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven, Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge but I can't forget the sound

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

[Hook 2: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down

[Half-Hook: Ed Sheeran]
And we'll crash, crash right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash right down again

[Hook 2: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down




[Verse 1]
There's a thin, thin line between love and hate
Between a heart that's whole and a heart that breaks
Between ending the world or saving the day
There's a thin, thin line between love and hate

[Chorus]
We used to be so happy, didn't we?
We used to say that forever'd be easy
But the day that you lied, I felt it all change
I crossed that thin, thin line between love and hate

[Verse 2]
Now there's a thin, thin line between you and me
Between what this is now and what we used to be
The one that you choose to the one that you cheat
Now there's a thin, thin line between you and me

[Chorus]
We used to be so happy, didn't we? (We used to be happy)
We used to say that forever'd be easy (Forever'd be easy)
But the day that you lied, I felt it all change (Oh)
I crossed that thin, thin line between love and hate

[Bridge]
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh (We used to be happy)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now there's a thin, thin line between love and hate
Between a heart that's whole and a heart that breaks

[Chorus]
We used to be so happy, didn't we? (We used to be happy)
We used to say that forever'd be easy (Forever'd be easy)
But the day that you lied, I felt it all change (Oh)
I crossed that thin, thin line between love and hate

[Outro]
Ooh (We used to be happy)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Forever'd be easy)
Ooh, ooh (We used to be happy)
Ooh, ooh, ooh




[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
There's a thin, thin line between love and hate
Between a heart that's whole and a heart that breaks
Between ending the world or saving the day
And there's a thin, thin line between love and hate

[Chorus]
We used to be so happy, didn't we?
We used to say that forever'd be easy
But the day that you lied, I felt it all change
I crossed that thin, thin line between love and hate

[Verse 2]
Now there's a thin, thin line between you and me
Between what this is now and what we used to be
The one that you choose to the one that you cheat
There's a thin, thin line between you and me

[Chorus]
But we used to be so happy, didn't we?
We used to say that forever'd be easy
But the day that you lied, I felt it all change
I crossed that thin, thin line between love and hate

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a thin, thin line between love and hate
Between a heart that's whole and a heart that breaks

[Chorus]
We used to be so happy, didn't we? (We used to be happy)
We used to say that forever'd be easy (Forever'd be easy)
But the day that you lied, I felt it all change
I crossed that thin, thin line between love and hate

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (We used to be happy)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh




[Verse 1]
Where do I go from here? Tell me baby
If I can't have you near
I've been running in circles for you
Got a fever of a hundred and two
Can't fake how I feel for you
This foolish heart of mine gets frustrated
Can't read between the lines
And the signal that I'm waiting for
Is always locked behind the door
And It makes me want you more

[Chorus]
So let your love shine down on me
And I will surrender
Wear my heart upon your sleeve
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever
So let your love shine down on me

[Verse 2]
If I could have my way, I'd take you baby
Out every night and day
You're the battery to my heart
And without you I can't start
Don't you leave me in the dark

[Chorus]
So let your love shine down on me
And I will surrender
Wear my heart upon your sleeve
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever
So let your love shine down on me

[Bridge]
You know I wanna believe
I wanna see the light
So let your love shine down on me
You know I wanna believe (Wanna believe)
I wanna see the light (See the light)
So let your love shine (Love shine) down on me (Down on me)
You know I wanna believe (You know I wanna believe)
I wanna see the light (I wanna see the light)
So let your love shine down on me
You know I wanna believe (I wanna believe)
I wanna see the light (I wanna see the light)
So let your love shine down on me (Let it shine, yeah)
Just shine it right down
You know I wanna believe
I wanna see the light (See the light)
So let your love shine down on me (Yeah)
Just shine it right down
You know I wanna believe
I wanna see the light (See the light)
So let your love shine down on me (Oh)

[Chorus]
So let your love shine down on me
And I will surrender
Wear my heart upon your sleeve
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever
So let your love shine down on me


[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself


[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up

I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself


[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 3: Anth]
Good days, better nights
No stress, no fights
Cold drinks, city lights
This is what I used to call the good life
Hah, and now I tell myself
Staring at my cell phone just won't help
Keeping all the clothes on my top left shelf
Is only gonna keep me in this hell, oh well
So wow, stumble at the hotel lobby
Looking for a cab to the afterparty
Tryna fit five girls in the back
The only thing on my mind is where the hell you at
Are you with your new man?
Fuck, drink drink
Are you making new plans?
Fuck, drink drink
Bottles 'til I can't stand, can't think, think
I can't think, can't think

[Outro: Conor Maynard]
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home


[Verse 1]

And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself




[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

[Verse 2: Drewsome]
Now lemme start off by saying this
I never let another woman do what you did
And I held myself back from ever talking shit
Cause I swore to always be the bigger man and never diss
But what you've been doing has got me really pissed
So you better stop telling people that we fucking kissed
Cause we didn't and you know that's some middle school shit
All we were was just friends, good friends that it
So for all the times that you told lies about me
Or when you said I was cheating on Sky with Emily
Or even when you lied to about my sexuality
I don't have time to care and I couldn't if I tried
So girl, if your gonna talk shit get your facts straight
And it's a fact that we never went on one date
So if you think I'm still holding on get some help
Cause baby you should go and fuck yourself


[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 1]
You made me breakfast every morning
You made me sleep all through the night
You made me worry without any warning
Let me just lie here, drown in your eyes, dear
You made me sorry, this wasn't always
You made me hungry for your body, babe
You made me run down hospital hallways
You gave me life, dear and he has got your eyes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I waited so long, baby, I did you wrongs
Make up for the time we've wasted
You would wait by the phone
Every time I was gone, but all along

[Chorus]
You are everything I have never been
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering why you let me in
I want you to make me better

[Verse 2]
You made me stop and savour the moment
You made me laugh out loud, you do
You give me memories like time is frozen
You gave me a child and he's got your smile


[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I sang a song every night I was gone
About all the dreams I'm chasing
And I have been wrong
With the things that I've done 'cause all along

[Chorus]
You are everything I have never been
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering why you let me in
I want you to make me better

[Bridge]
Although that I've never read your mind
I figured it out on my own
I am so glad that I caught you in time
Before I am left all alone, alone

[Outro]
You are everything I have never been
I want you to make me better
So please, my darling, take this wedding ring
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering why you ever let me in
I want you to make me better
I want you to make me better
I want you to make me better

When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
Though I could never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
Deep down in my heart's where you belong

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there is nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The winds are blowing on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
There is nothing that I would not do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love



[From Snippet]

I could be that someone if you want to
The city don't sleep much at night
Maria don't care 'cause that's a lie




[Verse 1]
Come ye masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

[Verse 2]
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
As the fast bullets fly

[Verse 3]
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

[Verse 4]
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

[Verse 5]
And you've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

[Verse 6]
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

[Verse 7]
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?
Well, I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

[Verse 8]
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
And I'll follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch as you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
To make sure that you're dead

[Outro]
Cool
He's an intense guy, isn't he?


(Vers 1)

Come, you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behinds desks
I just want you to know that I can see through your masks

(vers 2)

You that never done nothing
But build to destroy
You that play with my world
Like it's your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

(vers 3)

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But i see through your eyes
And i see trough your brain
Like i see through the water
that runs down my drain


(vers 4)

You that fasten all the triggers
For the others to fight
And you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young peoples blood
Flows out of their bodies
and is buried in the mud

(vers 5)

you've thrown the worst fear
It can never be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threadning my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
that runs in your veins

(vers 6)

How much do i know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say that I'm unlearned
But there is one thing i know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never forgive
what you do


(vers 7)

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I will think that you will find
When your dead takes its toll
All the money you made
will never buy back your soul

(vers 8)

And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
And I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I will stand over your grave
to make sure that you're dead

[Verse 1]
I don't know if there's a God up in Heaven
But I met an angel today
Though her wings might be hidden
'Cause I don't see no feathers
She's made of light and of grace

[Pre-Chorus]
And so she took my hand
And she lead me down
As we sat by the water's edge

[Chorus]
And I said, "Matthew's daughter
Heaven knows I'm a sinner and I've made mistakes
So bathe me in water
Come and dive in the river, you can start again"

[Verse 2]
No, I don't see no halo but I know that it's there
Resting one inch over her auburn hair
And I told her my secrets, the darkest I have
And I swear that she sees me for all that I am

[Chorus]
And I said, "Matthew's daughter
Heaven knows I'm a sinner and I've made mistakes
So bathe me in water
Come and dive in the river, we can start again"


[Bridge]
And then she took my hand, said, "My love, don't you worry
It only means there's a heart in your chest
Ooh, so follow me love and come away with me
To where the sun rises in the west"

[Chorus]
Then I said, "Matthew's daughter
Heaven knows I'm a sinner and I've made mistakes
So bathe me in water
Come and dive in the river, you can start again"

[Outro]
And I said, "Matthew's daughter
Heaven knows I'm a sinner and I've made mistakes
So bathe me in water"
And she said to me, "Darling, lemme ease your pain
Come and dive in the water, you can start again"

[Hook]
(Labrinth)
No matter where I've been, no better place than where I live
And sometimes we start again to show them why we first begin
And oh oh
(Ed Sheeran)
I know it's been a long time so won't you say it again?
(ShezAr)
Meanest man up in my city
Meanest man up in my city
Meanest man up in my city
Meanest man up in my city
Ain't no time to sit around and look pretty

[Verse 1: Devlin]
Check my grin and and crooked smile, son I'm still a crooked child
Murder any crocodile that's lurking in the river Nile
Maybe I should think a while, scrap that and think again
I'm thinking vile, I'll fuck your bird like Harry Styles
But I've been dirty like Harry since I've been lurking in Daggy
But then I used my 'ed in the lab like I was free to
I don't need you, like my boy Scissors let me slice you into slivers
Burn you I'm the boss, you're about to die Smithers
You must be Justin Timberlake I see you crying rivers
Tell me who's the sickest and realest, the science spitters
Stick my dick in Diane Vickers, it's lucky I'm not religious
But now I'm fucking cross, I've got my adversaries touching cloth
Meanest MC you'll see or come across


[Verse 2: Labrinth]
Devlin I think I might just take it from here
Call me a genius
Who gives a bloody rats arse what I'm seen as?
Maybe if you throw me a guitar and a beat
I can show you why these freshman don't dance with the seniors
Too many fake believers
Too many copycats trying to play Jesus
Too many followers pied piping, they ain't leaders
I smell something fishy, pull out a can of Febreze (poof)
And breathe in, you and me sin, ain't a saint see I know we're all evens
Honesty is a step closer to freedom
That's what I'll be even if that don't mean rich
So fuck all these fake popstars
Even Nina Simone's saying that I go hard, come on
Yeah, I go hard now

[Hook]
(Labrinth)
No matter where I've been, no better place than where I live
And sometimes we start again to show them why we first begin
And oh oh
(Ed Sheeran)
I know it's been a long time so won't you say it again?
(ShezAr)


[Verse 3: Wretch 32]
My Wretchercise is everybody's insanity
What you call a casualty, I be causing casually
What you call a salary I used to cause a cavity
What you call rapping B I call it chatting rapidly
Got in tune with gravity, when they tried stabbing me
But dumb fools couldn't say a sentence on my scrabble street
I speake the truth and I live by it, I'm taking the piss, I'm on a shit diet
Bought a fast car to keep the kids quiet
Driving down memory lane I see mum crying
Six sirens, pigs flying officer violent wringing my neck
Tryna ask me for my Dad but I'm on silent
Strong silence, suck your Mum trying

[Verse 4: Ed Sheeran]
I'm back with the next hit, I'm screaming out till you accept it
Unwritten words should be corrected
I'm fucking dyslexic, a dirty flow over the beat
Making it sound so sweet but septic
I'm bumping the fresh shit, with Lab, Devlin and now Wretch is
Making every fan get restless
A heavy heart hanging from my chest like a necklace
And yeah I've got papers but I don't tell the press shit
You should expect this, I'm making a believer from sceptics
And no gift shop at the exit
Well this is a head trip, I spent a couple years in a bedsit
A cesspit but I don't forget this
Your lyrics hold no weight, they're anorexic
You better invest in an alphabetical breakfast
If you feel disrespected, that's just the way the words are collected
Just giving you a little perspective, now you know


[Bridge: Labrinth]
Just when they though I couldn't cross the line
That's when I got here in the nick of time
Cuz who are they to say, That ain't fly as a motherfucker
No time for faded dreams, bring out the laser beams and say..

[ShezAr]
(Meanest man up in my city, ain't no time to sit around and look pretty)



[Lisa]
I know I was happier with you

[Katherine]
Walking down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier, you do

[Lisa]
Saw you walk into your car
She said something to make you laugh, oh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
You look happier, you do

[Lauren]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do

[Katherine]
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

[Christina]
'Cause lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, and I want you to be happier

[Dani]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun

[Amy]
But we've run our course, we pretended we're okay
But if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Lisa]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me

[Lauren]
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Dani]
Baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too

[Amy]
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Katherine]
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah

[Amy]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

[Dani]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier, it's true
And even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, it's true

[Christina]
And I could try to smile and hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Lisa]
So I'll go, I'll go
I'll go, go

[Lauren]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Verse 1]
Well, I've walked this street
Well, I've walked this street before
And everyone's locked up their door
Cause they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what?

[Hook]
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

[Verse 2]
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what?

[Hook]
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery


[Verse 3]
It's taken you a long time to see
In misery
And everyone's locked up their door
Cause they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what?

[Hook]
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

[Verse 2 (repeated)]
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what?

[Hook]
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery


[Outro]
It's taken you a long time to see
In misery

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Took time to get you
Took time to let you know
Tried to forget you
You're unforgettable

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
There's 24 hours in a day
I think about you more than 24 times
Just tryna not think about you
But you've been on my mind
I got nothing for you but time
'Cause you always end up by my side
Through loving you, I needed time
I needed time, and now I'm like

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Can I hit it like that?
Like this, like that?
Uh-huh, you know
Can I kiss it like that?
Like this, like that?
Remember that
Heaven, it feels like that
I won't lie to you, no, no
Can I hit it like that?
I've been waiting


[Hook: Tory Lanez]
For you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you
I've been waiting on and on and-

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Took time to find you
You left to go away
Must I remind you, feelings don't go astray, no

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
There's 24 hours in a day
I think about you more than 24 times
Just tryna not think about you
But you've been on my mind
I got nothing for you but time
'Cause you always end up by my side
Through loving you, I needed time
I needed time, and now I'm like

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Can I hit it like that?

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
For you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
Oh yes, it's true, true, true, true
I can be different for you, you, you, you
Show me the things I gotta do, do, do, do
I will be different for you, you, you, you
You, woah



[Verse 1]
Shock, horror, I'm down, lost, you're not around
There's a lump in my chest that sends cold through my head, and
My mind shuts sound out
I'm on auto-pilot, and my tongue's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down, next to you and me

[Hook 1]
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you

[Verse 2]
These words mean nothing to me
I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching, constrict and suffocating
My mind is racing with the picture I'm painting
And my belly's sick to its stomach
When I remember all the times he was with you when you laid it down
When you lay down next to me

[Hook 2]
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you, more than I let on
I kissed you far too long
I'll let go as soon as you do
See I know we're not through

[Hook 1]
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you

[Outro]
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you




[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Took time to get you
Took time to let you know
Tried to forget you
You're unforgettable

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
There's 24 hours in a day

I needed time, and now I'm like

[Verse 1: Liam]
Shut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you, I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this, even though I try
Heart beats harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

[Chorus: All]
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today

[Verse 2: Niall & Louis]
Close the door, throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded, don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded like tonight's sky
Hands are silent, voice is numb
Try to scream out, my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

[Chorus: All]
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today

[Bridge: Zayn]
Flashing lights in my mind, going back to the time
Playing games in the street, kicking balls with my feet
There's a numb in my toes, standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes at the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall, make a joke of it all

[Chorus: All]
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today


[Verse 1: Liam]
Shut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you, I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this, even though I try
Heartbeats harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

[Chorus: All]
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today

[Verse 2: Niall & Louis]
Close the door, throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded, don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded like tonight's sky
Hands are silent, voice is numb
Try to scream out, my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face


[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

[Chorus: All]
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time

You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today



[Verse 1]
Come on now, dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you
Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags

[Hook]
You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say?)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away

[Verse 2]
You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again
And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you, I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still got to pack my bags

[Hook x2]
You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say?)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away

You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say?)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away


[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Now it seems I've been young, dug my hole in the ground
To me there's only up, there ain't no point in looking down
However hard I try, I only get weaker
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold

[Bridge 1: Ed Sheeran]
What you gotta do is never get yourself down
Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground
Keep out of trouble, ain't no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it

[Verse 3: ALONESTAR]
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived
And as the mist clears, homie I arise
From my tomb in disguise
I'm all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move
Now back up


[Hook]
Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it

[Verse 4: ALONESTAR]
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who...what the fuck does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder
It don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?

[Bridge 2: Ed Sheeran]
Keep out of trouble, ain't no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Olly Murs
Big Snoop Dogg
You know we 'bout to make moves, ya dig?

[Verse 1: Olly Murs]
I walk in the club like a million bucks
First I hit the bar for a couple of shots
We got the  beautiful women, I think I'm makin' 'em blush
Then I spill my drink tryna cover it up
Got those dad dance moves, they ain't ready for 'em
Got the bad man groove, go steady on them
Hey senorita in her beautiful dress
Do you wanna dance? She's tellin' me "yes

[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]
I got confidence in myself
But that's just Tequila giving me help
Tryna cover it up, so you never tell
I feel like dancin' with you

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
It's your moves, baby
'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do
But I got that love that you ain't used to, hey
And when the DJ's spinnin' that song that we groove to
Oh my, come and teach me how to dance


[Verse 2: Olly Murs]
Slow down!
DJ, play that track
Check out my kung-fu kicks, like I'm under attack
I wave my arms like this from front to back
Bet you never seen a bad mother dance like that
Then you're backing me in with a kiss on the lips
Jump into the middle, come and  wiggle your hips
My love, take my hand, I'll give you a spin
Step once, step twice, let the party begin

[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]
I got confidence in myself
But that's just Tequila giving me help
Tryna cover it up, so you never tell
I feel like dancin' with you

[Chorus: Olly Murs & (Snoop Dogg)]

Snoop

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Dance to the rhythm of the D.O. dub, G and a thug
Watch how I be in the club
Lookin', starin', darin', comparin'
In my book, they say sharin' is carin'
So give me a taste (Haha)
And make your hips just dip to the bass
And watch me run the line
See what I come to find?


[Chorus: Olly Murs & Snoop Dogg]
It's your moves, baby (Ya dig?)
'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do (Yeah)
But I got that love that you ain't used to (Ha ha), hey (Snoop!)
And when the DJ spinnin' that song that we groove to
Oh my, come and teach me how to dance
It's your moves, baby (Dance to the rhythm of the D.O. dub)
'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do (In my book, they say sharin' is carin')
But I got that love that you ain't used to (Dance to the rhythm of the D.O. dub)
And when the DJ spinnin' that song that we groove to
(You know we about to make moves)
Oh my, come and teach me how to dance (Ya dig?)

[Verse 2: Olly Murs]
Slow down!
DJ, play that track
Check out my kung-fu kicks, like I'm under attack
I wave my arms like this from front to back
Bet you never seen a bad mother dance like that
Then you're backing me in with a kiss on the lips
Jump into the middle, come and wiggle your hips
My love, take my hand, I'll give you a spin
Step once, step twice, let the party begin

[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]
I got confidence in myself
But that's just Tequila giving me help
Tryna cover it up, so you never tell
I feel like dancin' with you

[Chorus: Olly Murs, Lady Leshurr]
It's your moves, baby
'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do
Ha, ha, but I got that love that you ain't used to, hey
And when the DJ's spinnin' that song that we groove to (Yeah)
Oh my, come and teach me how to dance

[Verse 3: Lady Leshurr]
He said "teach me how to dance"
He made the move on me had to [?] hands, that's right
Michael Jackson with the moonwalk
Mick Jagger with the moves on the dance floor
Hey, we're 'bout to have a good time, come on
Hey, It's 'bout to be a long night, come on
Hey, so play my favourite song
I'm with my Olly, Olly, Olly (Oy, oy, oy)

[Verse 1: Olly Murs]
Ahh, I walk in the club like a million bucks
First I hit the bar for a couple of shots
We got the  beautiful women, I think I'm makin' 'em blush
Then I spill my drink tryna cover it up
Got those dad dance moves, they ain't ready for 'em
Got the bad man groove, go steady on them
Hey senorita in her beautiful dress
Do you wanna dance? She's tellin' me "yes"

[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]

Snoop

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Dance to the rhythm of the D.O. dub, G and a thug
Watch how I be in the club
Lookin', starin', darin', comparin'
In my book, they say sharin' is carin'
So give me a taste
And make your hips just dip to the bass
And watch me run the line
See what I come to find?

[Chorus: Olly Murs & Snoop Dogg]
It's your moves, baby (Ya dig?)
'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do (Yeah)

And when the DJ spinnin' that song that we groove to
Oh my, come and teach me how to dance



[Verse 1]
You came home crying from school today
Walked past me, trying to hide the tears there on your face
It's hard for me to explain
How humans find the pleasure of causing people pain

[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes, there's more to the story
And we don't know what's going on in
That home, behind closed doors
Maybe there is something wrong
So be brave, my little one
I know you can be strong
'Cause you are just like your mum

[Chorus]
Say my name
When you're hurting, darling
I'll take the demons away
But you know there will come a day
When I won't be there, but
I know that you'll be okay
'Cause you are my blood
You're my blood

[Verse 2]
Oh, I was 22 years old
My mother told me that you learn more as you go
But I've spent many nights alone
Do I need more for me to make this house a home?

'Cause sometimes there's more to the story
And they don't know what's going on
My life behind closed doors
Maybe there is nothing wrong
And I will keep holding on
I know I can be strong
'Cause I am just like my mum

[Bridge]
And she told me, "Say my name
When you're hurting, darling
I'll take the demons away
But you know there will come a day
When I won't be there, but
I know that you'll be okay
'Cause you are my blood"

[Breakdown]
(My blood, my blood, my blood)
You're my blood
(My blood, my blood, my blood)
You're my blood

[Bridge]
So, say my name
When you're hurting, darling
I'll take the demons away
But you know there will come a day
When I won't be there, but
I know that you'll be okay
'Cause you are my blood

[Chorus 2]
(My blood) my blood, you're my...
(My blood) yeah, you're my blood, you're my blood
(My blood) ooh-ooh (My blood)
(My blood) you're my blood


[Verse 1]
I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 2]
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters


[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 3]
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Ed Sheeran]
I said, oi, you, are you gonna bang doe?
No, I want some fucking Nando's
Wanna eat up with chicken and chips
Everyone knows I freestyle like this
When I freestyle on the beat about chicken
You know it's finger lickin'
And now I'm gonna pass it over to Example now
He's gonna freestyle and he's gonna show you how

[Example]
Chicken, chicken wings
They're my favourite things and I love to sing
I say chicken, chicken wings
If you give me them I will eat them tings

[Ed Sheeran]
Yo, and we eat chicken for free
Cause he's got a black card you see
He made a song about chicken from Nando's
And are you gonna bang yo?
Yes please I want some chicken right now
Please I want to put it in my stomach yes
It tastes so good I wanna eat the chicken
With the fucking breasts and the wings
And the thighs and the chips and the...


[Example]
And all them things that are nice
[One sec, keep going]
Nando's from me, fat chance I gotta black card
If you come to me and ask for chicken you'll get a fat scar
In your left cheek I eat Nando's every week
Sometime on a Tuesday, sometime on a Thursday (yo)
I get free drinks, refillable even when I'm thirsty
On a Thursday I eat chicken in the worst ways

[Ed Sheeran]
Yeah, I said we are on tour, saw him
I'm like get out the store, yo!
Cause you are a whore
Eat Nando's for free everyday on tour, yo!
And it's a par, I ate Nando's from your car
Can't freestyle cause you'll see me starve
I slap you in the face cause like I'm like Febreeze ya!

[Example]
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
I eat chicken off the floor
I eat chicken off the bone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken off the floor
Chicken off the sky
Chicken off the bone
I eat chicken off the bone


[Example & Ed Sheeran]
I love Nando's more than your mum does
More than your mum does
Nando's (I say oh)
I love Nando's
My tongue is on fire
I wanna say Elliot (yes Ed?)
Nando's I desire (I'll give it to you anytime you want babe)
I want some free Nando's from your black card

[Example]
You ain't getting in my wallet
Ain't getting in my wallet
I'm on it, I'm on it (I wanna take your black card)
You ain't getting my wallet

[Ed Sheeran]
Cause I need them pounds every time I go there to eat my food
And you're so fucking rude you don't fucking buy it for me
So I want Nandos for free
And you look like you put your fingers in electricity sockets
To get your hair up like this

[Example]
You're never touching my card, this is my card
You're never touching my card, this is my card
You come to me, play your guitar
Step to me hard, you ain't getting my card star


[Example & Ed Sheeran]
I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's (right now)
I want some Nando's right now

[Intro]
Nah nah nah nah nah

[Verse 1]
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


[Verse 2]
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Malaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


[Bridge]
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Outro]
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man



[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh now now

[Verse 1]
Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night
And sing along to every song that's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn
Oh no no, the sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again

[Chorus]
Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new love
In New York

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast
And you don't know where to begin
Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again

[Chorus]
Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new life
In New York

[Bridge]
And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying maybe that's
A waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight
In New York

[Outro]
It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
And we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything that you want
A new love
In New York


[Verse 1: Random Impulse]
They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's ever been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me


[Verse 2: Sway]
You better wake up cause I A.M making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy tryna keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding
And I had to fight to get her, I am tekken (taking)
Control of my inception
Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection
See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back
Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them
See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish
Cause the haters know where the family lives
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger
Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did
They say sleep is the cousin of death
But I ain't hearing that shh... cousin, I'm-
Gang signs I'm in LA reading (LA Reid'n)
I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next (Sway)

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me


[Verse 3: Wretch 32]
They're watching me, they watch me sleep
Let me go
I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep
See, all the dreams I'm fond of
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I'm Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up
And I missed my chance, worst luck
Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner
Yeah, but I walked from that ish
Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me

They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen?
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's never been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading

Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me

You better wake up cause I am making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception
Cause they try to hit misses with my direction
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night
The haters know where the family lives
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it
They say sleep is the cause of death
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs I'm N/A reading
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next


Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me
They watching me! They watch me sleep!

Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep
See, all the dreams I'm fonder
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up
And I missed my chance worst luck
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah, and I walked from ish
Thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress


Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me!

[Verse 1]
I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

[Chorus]
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that's you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?


[Verse 2]
And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can't help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

[Chorus]
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that's you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?


[Bridge]
Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh won't you leave me now?

[Chorus (Extended)]
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and Love will go)
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that's you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and Love will go)
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that's you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

[Ed Sheeran:]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a King?
What's a King to a God?
What's a God to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?

We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild

[Devlin:]
Blood stains on North London floors
Peace to every young person taken by the law
The police equivalent of Raoul Moat is at your door
They've got machine guns and now they're ending lives like it was war
I still get asked for ID for cigarettes at twenty three
But at eighteen, they send the kids abroad and
Give 'em the licence to kill
Tell them to ride but it's still
If that was me and you, we'd see the rest of the life in the ville
With no uphill, so I tell you how I feel
Cause everything I see is lies, so sick it makes me ill
OT from old thugs that run tills, who on drugs
Or on mils with a house up in the hill
I'm tryna follow suit with the latter
To everybody in a manor
If I can be a famous rapper, then you truly will
Break the mould if you wanna
But I ain't no one to follow
I'm just a road kid
With a little more of a passion and honour, so...

[Ed Sheeran:]

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a King?
What's a King to a God?
What's a God to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?

We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild

[Labrinth:]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption

[Devlin:]

There ain't no church in the wild to inhabit
Ain't no one to idolize but those who supply to the addicts
Long days, tired nights, why do we fight with this planet?
I don't know but I ain't got the time for bible-bashing
I don't need a God, I need to plot to see the top
So carry on talking instead of walking, then you see the mob
Stood behind me in unison, oportune to the men
That's tired of being down, now we're standing and overruling them
So tell me, what's a peasant with the passion?
Ten times the riches any Pharaoh could imagine
How dare this white gutter child climb out of the chasm
That you thought you could secure me in?
You surely couldn't fathom
World-rated talent inside of a mind, unbalanced
And I ain't been an angel but I'm nothing like a judge
Who gives a beast three years and goes home and makes love
If that's upper class, then I'd rather be scum
Son

[Ed Sheeran & Labrinth:]
Human being to the mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?

We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild




[Intro: Ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande]
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Another night, another club
Another room, another one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
I don't know why, you're not enough

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Another night, another day
Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now
This ain't man's world, thank you next, I'ma go my own way
Sometimes being solo is the way to go
When you need to figure shit out
And if I want you boy, I'ma tell you so
'Cause I'm the one in control, yeah

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande]
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande]
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Yuh), no lo-lo-love for the lonely (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande]
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me, yeah
My love is a flickering candle (Flickering candle, yeah), in the dark

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande]
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Yuh), no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Love for the lonely), no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark

[Outro: Ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande]
And I will try to find someone to hold me (Mhm)
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark




[Verse 1]
I'm screaming out upon my face
Followed footsteps catch my pace
Broken windows fall in place
Now shattered lovers find their place
We'd flirt
And you'd treat me like dirt
All the pain and the hurt
Just to make matters worse

[Pre-Chorus]
And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
You're better off with me

[Chorus]
We're stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass

[Verse 2]
All I ever felt for you
Went up in a cloud of smoke
How I could I be such a fool
To ever think that we were close?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Born with a heart
That could ache more than beat
The mind of the killer
The soul of the meek
Born aimless and angry
Ran hard from the day
Left love at the crossroad
Into a man that I hate

[Pre-Chorus]
Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I drop to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?

[Chorus]
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?

[Verse 2]
I fight for the hope
That blood has a face
To give me a kiss
For the faith that I wait
Flock with no shepherd
Is a vulnerable game
I can live without heart, without love
But I do need a name


[Pre-Chorus]
Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I drop to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?

[Chorus]
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?



[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like "Damn"
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Paulo Londra]
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Prr)
But they ain't got nothing on you (Ah, ah)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones Con Flow)

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Give me that old school love right now
You know when I hold you, you won't be alone
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want a (eeeeeeeh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like
Nigga I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school
Wassup...

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Give me your old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now


[Verse 1]
Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now


[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

[Bridge]
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

Don't say anything more
I could tell by the way you're not looking at me
Staring at the floor

You could at least look me in my eyes and
Tell the truth this time
Classic you, running away from the problems
Instead of solving them

So, don't leave me alone
It wasn't part of the plan
For you to lead me on, yeah
You told me we would be more than this

I feel my heart breaking again
I don't wanna just be your friend
I guess everything beautiful ends
Why can't you open your eyes
And see the tears in mine
Ooh, come on, say that you love me
One last time

Don't try to tell me you're sorry
I can tell by the way that you hold your body
You ain't so sure
You could at least say that you could try
To love me better
And you can do more than running away from all of your problems


But now I feel alone
This wasn't part of my plan
For you to lead me on
You told me we would be more than this

I feel my heart breaking again
I don't wanna just be your friend
I guess everything beautiful ends
Why can't you open your eyes
And see the tears in mine
Ooh, come on, say that you love me
One last time

Oh, I feel my heart breaking again
I don't wanna just be your friend
I guess everything beautiful ends
Why can't you open your eyes
And see the tears in mine
Ooh, come on, say that you love me
One last time

[Verse 1]
It's such a beautiful night, to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talking about love and life
Oh how lucky am I, when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way, to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake, and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I got to do
To be making a change, now the moment of truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Why I'm feeling so nervous?
Things are going so perfect
Now I know that it's worth it
To spend forever with you

[Chorus]
So I count to three, and get down on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I ask you, tonight, will you marry me?
Just say yes
It's one word, one love, one life

[Verse 3]
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh I was caught unaware
Oh so many times, I gazed in both of her eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of a life
Some will reappear, burning auburn and red
I'll chest the pill, bring us home to bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
What a wonderful way, to fall in deeper in with you


[Pre-Chorus]
Why was I feeling nervous?
When things were going so perfect
Well, now I know that it's worth it
To spend forever with you

[Chorus]
So I count to three, and get down on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I ask you, tonight, will you marry me?
Just say yes
It's one word, one love, one life

One life
One life

[Outro]
Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh you and I
Some things were just meant to be
Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh you and I
Some things were just meant to be
Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh you and I
Some things were just meant to be
Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh you and I
Some things were just meant to be



[Verse 1]
Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

[Bridge]
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one




[Verse 1]
Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention as she makes an entrance?
Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence
Oh well, she's a local girl
No make-up cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
It's like the fast food, I'll regret it after
And I needed money but I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man

[Pre-Hook]
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone

[Hook 1]
Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself

[Verse 2]
And we've got that love in us and we're the drink killers
We're gonna dance all night to the floor fillers
If we talk outside, say "Hey what's new?"
I don't really dance so I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight? Tell me if that's alright
I don't wanna be here, I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don't mind sharing
She said I wanna take off what you're wearing

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook 1]

[Bridge]
She's like the fast food, I'll regret it after
And I needed money but I'm too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she's all I need

[Hook 2]
Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself

[Hook 1]

San Francisco, city air, oh
Waiting for my bus to arrive
And I ain't heard from you in months
But you called me last night, cryin'
Saying that you want to end it all

Tears on the phone, tell me what went wrong
Cry, smile, cry
I know that the world ain't kind

You don't have to hurt yourself
I'm on my way
I know that you need some help
To ease the pain
We get down sometimes
That's a part of life
You don't have to hurt yourself
I'm on my way

San Francisco, speeding highway
The city looks beautiful tonight
Not as beautiful as you
You don't believe me but it's true
Baby just please stay on the path

Tears on the phone, tell me what went wrong
Cry, smile, cry
I know that the world ain't kind


You don't have to hurt yourself
I'm on my way
I know that you need some help
To ease the pain
We get down sometimes
That's a part of life
You don't have to hurt yourself
I'm on my way

I'm on my way

I know I never say this
"I can never take it"
Or "You didn't make it"
Or "You didn't shine"
Baby you're amazing
So don't go changing
Don't live the pain in your lie
You don't have to hurt yourself
You don't have to hurt yourself
You don't have to hurt yourself
I'm on my way
I know that you need some help
To ease the pain
We get down sometimes
That's a part of life
You don't have to hurt yourself
I'm on my way


I'm on my way
I'm on my way



[Verse 1]
Can't get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
I'll say what I don't mean
In your world we were the same
In mine now you're the one to blame
You can't remember my name
We're lost, it's such a shame

[Hook]
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I've been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see

[Verse 2]
I'm strong yet proud
I'm quiet yet loud
And I'm everything
You want in me
I'm small yet tall
I have it all
And I'm everything
You want me to be

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
I'm on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still

[Hook]




[Intro: Yelawolf]
Yeah, Slumdon Bridge
Mr Ed, Catfish
Back me up, let's go

[Verse: Yelawolf]
I'm out to bark again, ball cracked on the target
Demolish it, don't jump out your seat, nah, take a squat and then
Think while I jump back on the beat, like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech needs to retrieve blood
Should I creep into these ambient sounds with the speech? Obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's
Several pauses, you might need a coffin wit'
Holes in the top, with these tubes to receive oxygen
(Yeah) You're buried alive like a freak, six-feet
Clawin' and snatchin' and gnawin' like a cat, and a dog and a rat
And a hog in a pen with a frog and all there is to eat is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth, and jaws and then
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of him
See that, you back two bars again, he's asleep in a coffin, man
I'm all thee all that's been, ever was, I'm the start of it
You mention the squad and then you mention the god of pens
Not of men, but of harder than flesh, I'm harder than
Titanium breastplates that are polished, then
Sticking emcees up like a fly-trap, or a bobby-pin
When I rap I'm astonishing
I attack tracks like a train-track strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave's that's what I made, got this bastard popping then
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shihtzus, pisses on igloos
Throw it up 'til the whole fucking world is sick too
Vomitin' stomach-fluid like you just ate shit-stew
Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?
Neither does Little Johnny give a shit if he sniffed glue
Or Beethoven care if you like his hair or the stick used
To orchestrate, or does a porpoise hate when you dip through
Swimming in his ocean? No, he just moves
What I'm trying to say is
It's my motherfucking ocean
And I crossed it
Built the bridge, Slumdon Bridge, holler




[Verse 1: Liam & Niall & Both]
Said I'd never leave her 'cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she's feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?

[Chorus: Louis, Harry and Zayn & All]
If you're pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

[Verse 2: Harry & Louis]
Again we take the same road
Two days in the same clothes
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start

[Chorus: Louis, Harry and Zayn & All]
If you're pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

[Bridge: Zayn & Liam]
You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?
If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me

[Chorus: All & Harry & Zayn]
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
(All my heart)
So we can start it all over again
If you're pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
(If you're pretending from the start, yeah)
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again


[Chorus: Stormzy]
Own it
Girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya

[Verse 1: Stormzy & Burna Boy]
Lighters up, lighters up, one time, lighters up
Pulled up in the party, when you saw me, I was lightin' up my J
So go ahead and brighten up my day
Lighters in the air when you lighting up the rave
And it's feelin' like I met you here before ('Fore)
Girl, I felt your presence when they let you through the door (Door)
Never had a bruddah give you everything and more
So I take a little piece and then the rest of it is yours
Mi amore, I
E don tey wey I don dey I tell you
But, girl, you think say nah play (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I know no wetin you dey do me
Wey just dey scatter my brain (Ah, scatter my brain)
Thug lovin' when I put you in your place
I can tell you love it, just by lookin' in your face
It's the way that you wind up your waist, I'm so in awe
Girl you never have to worry 'bout nothing
You know it's all yours, you know you


[Chorus: Stormzy & Burna Boy]
Own it
Girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
(Everybody, body, body, body, body oluwaburna ti de)

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Lights down for the one I love
Right now (Right now), we never looked better
Forget our friends, girl, I love it when we chill together
And ain't nobody gonna feel what we feel together
She want a kiss, I, I want another one
You got a sick vibe, I wanted more than one
Up to now, nobody knew where I was comin' from
We got the same mind, so I don't wanna waste time
Bring it to me, come by, that's what I need
That's right, kissin' your cheek, one time
I used to love bein' alone (Alone), but now I can't stand it
I'm reachin' out my palm (Palm) for you to put your hand in (Ah-ahh)
Girl, you are the one and I don't understand it (Ooh yeah)
How you lighten up the room with your glow (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause girl, you just-


[Chorus: Burna Boy & Ed Sheeran]
Own it (Own it)
Girl, you just own it (Own it)

Nananana, nananana


[Verse 1]
You said "I love you" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn't believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I've been feelin' about you
It's time to break the chains that held me back from you

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it's time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Verse 2]
Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it's time to close the space between the two of us


[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it's time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Bridge]
Oh, baby it's time
Oh, it's time

[Chorus]
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now


[Outro]
Maybe it's time we put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
You know I got to get away
To find some peace and sanity
I've been playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everybody waking
Setting the hi-fi bleed
Keeping me back
While you're spinning my track
That'll knock you off your feet
Monkey see what monkey do
But I'm a monkey telling you
I just think that we should take a break
Tickity-tock the clock
With the hip-hop
And Alonestar backing me up
We won't stop
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind
Now let the track rewind

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on


[Verse 2:
This is Alonestar coming at you
With a new style
Kicking dust
Ready to bust
It's Urban Angel
Artistic, flipping the script
Who'd you really want to get it with?
Ed and Alonestar
We're like live wires sparking
Ready to blow
We've already sown our seeds
We're just waiting to grow, blow
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body
Metaphorical speech when we come and see
You ducking for cover
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock
With Urban Angel and Alonestar
And Ed, keep it locked
Let the beat pump
Drop the bass but don't stop
We're kicking the sound
Let the bass bins pound
We're gonna roll
Can you feel me now with my body?
Get down to the sound
It's Ed Sheeran in the place
And Alonestar rising up
We gotta rise up
I said rise up


[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Met her smoking a cigarette
In a toilet cubicle
Red dress, tattooed chest
She's beautiful
This ain't the time or place to start a future
But darling I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love
To make them whole anywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh darling, here we go again
We are only man or woman
And we all make mistakes
Don't you know we're only human
It's what our hardships say
And when I heard those words and knew them
I could feel your pain
Cause I have felt the same, oh

[Chorus]
She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?

[Verse 2]
She told about her mum and dad
And they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchanging names
We're two souls intertwined
We have both got it wrong
From time to time and let that go
With each other, hand in hand
As we mend broken souls

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, here we go again
We are only blood and bones
That cover beating hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones
But we know who we are
I could put you back together
When you come apart
We should make a start now

[Chorus]
She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in your eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?

[Bridge]
And it feels like we felt serenity
And some things are not what they seem
My love, right now it's only you and me

[Outro]
She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in your eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?
Can you feel the love in mine?

Be my girl, I'll be your man
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

But it's the only thing that I know

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing

Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"

And it's the only thing that I, I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

[Pre]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen, still


[Chorus 2]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever be alone

[Bridge]
'Cause it's you that I'm been waiting to find
It's shaking the sky
And I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find
(I'm holding it all tonight) Tonight
(I'm holding it all tonight) Ooh Ooh
(You know that you make it shine)
And it's you that I've been waiting to find
(I'm holding it all tonight) Tonight
(You know that you make it shine)
It's you that I've been waiting to find


[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home



Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's Ok, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's Ok, baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages
You just hold me and I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home."




[Verse 1]
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we go

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen, still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home

[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 13
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well, that's OK, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"




[Verse 1]
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It's the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus]

And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

[Bridge]
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

[Breakdown]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home

[Verse 1: Giggs]
Yeah, yeah, listen
Just came home from the dirtiest prison
I was blinded before, now I'm stuck with a vision
Made the toughest decision
Had to get my head down and buck up my religion
This is deep as it gets
Laying down on my deepest regrets
Locked up, I was sleeping upset
For little extra time out, had me sweeping the steps
Say it loud, say it proud
I'm a break it down every time I lay it down
And that's just the way it sounds
Ayo Ed, can we play it loud?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We're running to the rhythm we want to, we want to
Say it out loud, loud
'Til we break away from everything
Speakers to the streets of this town
Scream it when you play it out loud, loud
Just break away from all that holds you down

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Live up to the music, don't ever fucking confuse it
I do this for the breddas locked up stuck in the unit
The breddas starving in his cell, he's up and he's fuming
Still he's tryin'a get Westwood, he's up and he's tuning
His baby mama's pissed off, fed up and she's fuming
She hates him and she's thinking of moving
Cell mate rolled a burn, sat up and he 2s(ed) him
Tryin'a get her on the phone, she hung up and abused him
He grabbed a Bible, read a page, it was soothing
It made him realise just how low he was stooping
Man, that bredda was stupid
But repenting to the Lord, he's back up and exclusive
Try'n play it down, what you saying now?
Ayo Ed, can we play it now?


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We're running to the rhythm we want to, we want to
Say it out loud, loud
'Til we break away from everything
Speakers to the streets of this town
Scream it when you play it out loud, loud
Just break away from all that holds you down

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran and (Giggs)]
Just let me fade away and I'll be alright
(You ain't saying nothing that I ain't said already)
Give me another way, to release my light
(This is Hollowman Giggs, won't you tell 'em Eddy)
Hearing my brother say, I should speak my mind
(If it weren't for music man, I think, I'd be dead already)
Just let me fade away and I'll be alright
Play it out loud

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We're running to the rhythm we want to, we want to
Say it out loud, loud
'Til we break away from everything
Speakers to the streets of this town
Scream it when you play it out loud, loud
Just break away from all that holds you down

Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I'm so frustrated, so dilated
And she's telling me I've wasted my time
And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat

Still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we're asking for so much more
Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor

Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I'm so frustrated, so dilated
And she's telling me I've wasted my time
And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, 'cos I won't mind
I doubt if I even know that I'm awake


And still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we're asking for so much more
Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor



[Verse 1]
Hey, pretty woman, I wanna take you out
I know a place, we can move our feet downtown
Ease into the rhythm when I hear that sound
My momma taught me and I do not back down
Hey, pretty woman, I love the way you move
Winding down low to that baseline groove
The way you're dancing got me in the mood
Daddy told me it's what grown folks do
Let me tell ya now
Hey, pretty woman, Imma testify
Hey, pretty woman make a grown man cry

[Chorus]
You can make me beg
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar)
Oh, honey, you can take it anyway you wanna
The way you move your legs
Well, it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma?

[Verse 2]
Hey, pretty woman, come and hold my hand
Dancing the Charleston to that old swing band
I know that it's getting late but you don't mind
Let's take a taxi and get back to mine
Hey, pretty woman, your daddy don't know
Take what you want from me, I can't say no
Just put your hands on my body, let me taste your lips
I put my hands on your body, baby, work those hips

[Chorus]
You can make me beg
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar)
Oh, honey, you can take it anyway you wanna
The way you move your legs
Well, it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma?

[Bridge]
Hey, pretty woman, na, na, na, I'm in love
You are the only one I'm thinking of
Hey, pretty woman, if you feel the same
Just say "hey there, boy, bring that beat back again"

[Chorus]
You can make me beg
Take my last dollar (take my last dollar)
Oh, honey, you can take it anyway you wanna, wanna
The way you move your legs
Well, it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma?
You can make me beg
Take my last dollar, dollar (take my last dollar)
Oh, honey, you can take it anyway you wanna
The way you move your legs
Well, it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma?




[Intro]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 1]
(Look) Let me tell you about pride
The struggle to survive
Living every day with your loving under fire
People questioning the ways that you self-identify
And who you choose to date is it never on your mind?
And that's why people so -  fascinated, they passive hating
Y'all repeat the rhetoric just like a class was taken
But I bet we could settle it just if the past were traded
And y'all were born a certain way and told you had to hate it
I'm doing me, y'all can disagree
But, people paid to talk, and y'all do it for free
But, you can see me walking, up and through the streets
(look) I'm still gonna sing

[Chorus]
I will not be ashamed
This is just who I am, who I was meant to be
No mistakes
And right here I stand, I'm out on my own two feet
No, you will not tear me down
No, my heart will not be bound
Singing loud, say it loud, I'm Proud
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (i'm proud)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (i'm proud)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (i'm proud)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (i'm proud)

[Verse 2]
I think it's time that we respect each other
Just being realistic, why do we expect each other to be the same
And if we aren't, then we reject each other
As if the way I use my heart will make me less than others
I lace up my shoes and walk in my truth
Cause being myself ain't nothing taboo
I go through the world with nothing to prove
Cause I've heard it all, man, I'm bulletproof
This ain't political, this is pivotal
Let me draw you up a visual of knowing who you are
I mean it's visceral, and then you open up and manifest it in the physical
Take a giant step but in the world, you're still invisible
I will demand that you understand
And you will respect the person I am
Cause I'm not afraid, look I do exist
I insist

[Chorus]
I will not be ashamed
This is just who I am, who I was meant to be
No mistakes
And right here I stand, I'm out on my own two feet
No, you will not tear me down
No, my heart will not be bound
Singing loud, say it loud, I'm Proud
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (i'm proud)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (i'm proud)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (i'm proud)
Oh oh, oh oh

[Bridge]
I'm proud, I'm proud, let me hear you say it (hear you say it)
I'm proud, I'm proud, no more hesitating (don't you hesitate)
I'm proud, I'm proud, let me hear you say it
I'm proud, I'm proud
Let them know sis

[Chorus]
I will not be ashamed
This is just who I am, who I was meant to be
No mistakes
And right here I stand, I'm out on my own two feet
No, you will not tear me down
No, my heart will not be bound
Singing loud, say it loud, I'm Proud
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (i'm proud)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (i'm proud)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (i'm proud)
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm Proud


[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me


[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Ella Mai & Both]
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me

[Verse 2: Ella Mai]
Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby

[Refrain: Ella Mai]
I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
It's you and only you that can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Ella Mai, Ella Mai]
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly (Hey)
My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need (Oh)
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me (Babe)

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Ella Mai]
Love, on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey baby, we can dance slowly (Slow)
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need (Need)
So put it all on me

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran & Ella Mai]
I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love



[Verse 1]
In shadow there lies hope
Cut tension with a knife
I find it hard to cope
Stop playing with my life
You analyse my fears
Analyse my dreams
Choke on burning tears
Through my silent screams

[Pre-Hook]
Things aren't what they seem

[Hook]
Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better

[Verse 2]
Watch me fall
As I stumble at your feet
Always losing in this game
Your lies cut me deep
And you don't even know my name
With your consistency
To always make me crawl
And my durability
Not affected at all

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Feel the pain
On my brain
Feel the strain
As I start to decay
Feel the strain
Every passing day
Feel the pain
As I start to decay

[Hook]




[Verse 1: Jme]
Hi, my name is Jme
There was a time when radio played me
'Cause my music came from my heart
It was real to me, but now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think
"Jme just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"
The reason I started making music is the exact same
Reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all of that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is
I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different?
Look at me, determined, man on a mission
My music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'mma do this

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I never had a playlist in my heart
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & (Jme)]
Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist)
How much will you pay me though
If this song's not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Jme]
Thank God for night clubs and the raves
'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down
But cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth
You won't hear me on the radio
But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why is that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I never had a playlist in my heart
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & (Jme)]
Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist)
How much will you pay me though
If this song's not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, written by the pile
So won't you hear me out?
Never feel it from the bass line, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won't you hear me out?

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I never had a playlist in my heart
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & (Jme)]
Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist)
How much will you pay me though
If this song's not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist)
How much will you pay me though
If this song's not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh




[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem, 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
Stay for the night
Call it what you want
And I'll compromise
To have you in my arms
Is this what you needed?
Cause I'll find my faith in anything
Don't fight the feeling
Rewind, repeat it

[Chorus]
If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it

[Verse 2]
Just close your eyes
And all you need to see
Is your heart and mine
Underneath the sheets
Don't fight your demons
Cause they will tear you apart from the seams
And if darkness creeps in
Rewind, repeat it


[Chorus]
If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it

[Verse 1]
Stay for the night
Call it what you want
And I'll compromise
To have you in my arms
Is this what you needed?
Cause I'll find my faith in anything
Don't fight the feeling
Rewind, repeat it

[Chorus]
If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it

[Verse 2]
Just close your eyes
And all you need to see
Is your heart and mine
Underneath the sheets
Don't fight your demons
Cause they will tear you apart from the seams
And if darkness creeps in
Rewind, repeat it

[Chorus]
If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

A little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his next grasp to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress less, mismatch
On his breast jackets is sex addict
And cheaters want to egg sack it for being checked, get back
It's a chest match, she's on his back like a jetpack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just so happens to be moving on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she deviced some plan to stab him in the back
Knifing hands, says the relationship hanging by a strip
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, in Spiderman

And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care


Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda' said "Bye

Suzanne" after the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief

Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

Little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain

Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

One night stand turned to two nights stand
It was cold, some lights gram
Y'all be hung tight and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous and suited
When it's too hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole In The Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just don't like the person who I'm turnin' into
Irreversible, I pray for you like a church at the pew


And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?

Get on my soap box and preach, my sermon
And speech
Detergent and bleach is burning in the womb

'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this bullshit anew
To use protection 'fore I pity to your forbidden crew

Fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat

All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
A little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain

Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (ooh)
My name's (ooh)


Denver, never run

Call me (ooh)
Call me (ooh)
River (ooh)
We'll let the river run

Always the bride's maid, never "The bride, hey!"
What can I say? If life was a highway
The sequels are non-clay
But be swerving in side lanes
Speeds that are high, rave like I'm sliding on ice maybe
That's why I'm made, that came at you sideways
I can't keep my life straight, what I made
You terminate my baby
This love drought angle
Left us in a rectangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
That I really woulda' loved your smile
Then you really wanna abort
But fuck it, what's one more lie to tell an unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
A little one
I don't want to admit to something (I'm sorry, I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: The Game]
My lawyer's son died in his sleep last night
Got me thinkin' 'bout who I was in my past life
To be surrounded by so much pain
I understand my karma, but why is their's the same?
Two good people, two amazin' sons
Just yesterday, they had both, now they raisin' one
I look at the clouds and just think
I could lose mine, or they could lose me in one blink
When I think one day it all ends, I start to drink
And fathom suicide, 'cause I was almost on the brink
And it feel like my family been jinxed
Ever since I found my grandmother stiff
Leanin' over the kitchen sink
I could cry enough tears to float Noah's Ark
Perfect health, but she died of a broken heart
And after that, it was a domino effect
First my uncle, then my daddy, I guess I'm in line next

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the Most High
'Cause he kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, mama, don't cry
I was on the roadside
I was on the roadside


[Verse 2: The Game]
How come you can't learn a lesson until you go through it?
How come you can think about the past, but can't go to it?
If I could, I would float through it
Walk up to Triple X's BMW window and stick a note to it
Tell him to drive off, the Devil comin'
Ever since he fell from Heaven, he been tryin' to settle somethin'
I keep the faith and try not to question God
But I got a problem when I see innocent people die
I sympathize with Jews, I sympathize with blacks
Sympathize with Natives, America's yours if you want it back
Where the hunger at?
Probably under a tree in Mississippi by the river where they hung us at
If Jesus walked, why we all runnin' laps?
Feel like endin' racism further than where the sun is at
A wall to keep people from people, how dumb is that?
I guess we shouldn't put our thoughts on the front of hats

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the Most High
'Cause he kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, mama, don't cry
I was on the roadside
I was on the roadside


[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
For sure that my soul will fly
Cold, drippin' on the other side
I know it happened to me every time
Caught out on the roadside
Thumb high in the wind, itch
I tell my mama I'ma be alright now
I'll be home in a few weeks
Soon, 'til then I'll sing this song to you

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the Most High
'Cause he kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, mama, don't cry
I was on the roadside
I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the Most High
'Cause he kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, mama, don't cry
I was on the roadside
I was on the roadside

[Verse 1]
I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

[Pre-Chorus]
"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but

[Chorus]
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

[Verse 2]
I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go


[Pre-Chorus]
"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but

[Chorus]
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

[Bridge]
Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack
Intends to show love
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days, I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder


[Chorus]
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own



[Intro: Jessie Ware]
One, two, three

[Verse 1: Jessie Ware]
Sat inside a railway station
Drinking a cup of coffee on my own
Listening to the strangest conversation
About children and holidays in Rome
Last night I sat inside a bar room
And I was thinking 'bout my childhood home
I think I need to talk to mama
'Cause I'm about to have a child all of my own

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
And I hope I'm as brave as my mother
Wondering what kind of mother will I be?
I hope she knows that I found a man far from my father
Sam, my baby, and me

[Verse 2: Jessie Ware, Jessie Ware & Ed Sheeran]
I've been thinking about my husband
From seventeen, the only love I've known
And I could place no one above him
So beautiful and so naive alone
I've not even called my family
About the life that's 'bout to find me home
For many years, the lights would blind me
But now I find they only want to lead me home

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
And I hope I'm as brave as my mother
Wondering what kind of mother will I be?
Hope she knows that I found a man far from my father
Sam, my baby, and me

[Bridge: Jessie Ware]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
And I hope I'm as brave as my mother
Wondering what kind of mother will I be?
Hope she knows that I found a man far from my father
Sam, my baby, and me
It's just Sam, my baby, and me




[Intro]
Uh, this is the last song
I love there's some "What?"
Um, this is the last song, um, and this feels quite poignant this evening
But, um, I hope you enjoy it
It's called "Sam"
And, uh, yeah
One, two three, four

[Verse 1]
Sat inside a railway station
Drinking a cup of coffee on my own
Listening to the strangest conversation
About children and holidays and Rome

Last night I sat inside a bar room
And I was thinking 'bout my childhood home
I think I need to talk to mama
'Cause I'm about to have a child all of my own

[Chorus]
And I hope I'm as brave as my mother
Wondering what kind of mother will I be?
I hope she knows that I found a man far from my father
Sam, my baby, and me

[Verse 2]

For many years, the lights would blind me
But now I find they only want to lead me home

Wondering what kind of mother will I be?
Hope she knows that I found a man far from my father

(instrumental)

[Chorus]
And I hope I'm as brave as my mother
Wondering what kind of mother will I be?
Hope she knows that I found a man far from my father
Sam, my baby, and me
It's just Sam, my baby, and me

[Outro]
(Instrumental)




[Verse 1]
Sara, what you do is enlighten my mind
Oh wow, I said
Sara, what you do is make my soul unwind

[Hook 1]
Hey now 'Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood
So I thought I'd write a song for you

[Hook 2]
And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that

[Verse 2]
Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow, I said
Sara, you say that you don't look good when you do
Even with that soul

[Hook 3]
Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood
So I thought I'd write a song for you

[Hook 2]
And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that

[Outro]
May I say, you look great
May I play this to make your day


On Saturday I know that you're coming up to see me
When I go away things will change
And you'll never know it was easy
It won't help pretending that we'll stay close
I can't help thinking that
I try to pretend that it's your loss
And I never know, oh I'll never know if it will work
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
And I left her today
And I left her today
Come Sunday I'll see that one day you'll rescue me
And when I leave again I'll feel strange
And I'll never know, oh I'll never know if you're in love again
I can't stop being a fool for you
I won't help thinking that
Still I am falling for her and she did too
Oh I'll never know, oh I'll never know if I'm in love
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today



[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Always want you to, prove it
Lil' mama, you know how I show it
Always want you to, prove it
Lil' mama, you know how I show it
Always want you to, prove it
Lil' mama, you know how I show it
Always want you to, prove it
Lil' mama, you know how I show it

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Tell me you're still poppin' on the low
You found you somebody and I know
Tell me you need time all for yourself
Tell me you're still poppin' on the low
'Cause late night, I still drop in on the low
He just took you shoppin', girl, I know
Don't let him buy his way up in it
You know that I can't let no nigga get one up on me, no no
And you know this shit
So how could you give him what you gave to me? No, no
'Cause what I did was wack but you don't get me back like that, girl, no

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I was all the way in it and my heart was way in it
And now it's hard to stay in it, the pride is all gone
Only reason we fuckin' is 'cause I know that you love him
And back then you let him get one up on me, girl
I know that he just doesn't cut it
Ain't nothin' gon' change you back to the girl I used to fuck with
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Tell me you're still poppin' on the low
Girl, you got someone that doesn't know
He can have your sex, I got your soul
Just don't give that to no one else, oh, no
Straight like this, tonight we fuck to my shit, call me up
Because the reason why them niggas just can't hit it right
They wasn't blessed with my dick, straight like that
You can say, ain't gotta lie, girl, no
'Cause when we fuckin', I'm in it
Goin' all the way in it, snappin' my feelings
It ain't my props, just offendin', I'm goin' off girl
For the nights that you fronted
Man, you told me you love him
But how could you love him?
You know when we fuckin', I'm deep in that sea

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I drop OZs in my blunt, 44 from down the way
It's that nigga, it's that nigga that you know from down the way
Shawty got somebody else but that someone isn't me
Now you want expensive taste, girl, that shit just isn't free
I stay lowed up, I stay rolled up in that thang on the low
Girl, you're different, you don't even act the same way no more
Girl, I know you're movin' on, I don't want you movin' on
Girl, how long have you been gone? What the fuck have you been on?

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I was all the way in it and my heart was way in it
And now it's hard to stay in it, the pride is all gone
Only reason we fuckin' is 'cause I know that you love him
And back then you let him get one up on me, girl
I know that he just doesn't cut it
Ain't nothin' gon' change you back to the girl I used to fuck with
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
Down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah
Fuck around and spend time on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
That's why I came back, top down
Even though you know that
You gon' have to do more than just say it
You gon' have to do less when you do it
Lil' mama you know how I show it
Always want you to prove it
You gon' have to do more than just say it
You gon' have to do less when you do it
Lil' mama you know how I show it
Always want you to prove it
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car whippin' out
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car, let you go
Gots to break it down for you
To let you know, you know the things I'm down for
Ain't going act like you ain't 'bout
My door you know ain't open, girl, you know I'm down for
Take your time to find you out
Won't hesitate to take the time to waste, no baby
Streamin' out, the foreign out to play
You know it's things it takes
Down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah

Fuck around and spend time on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
That's why I came back, top




[Verse 1]
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 2]
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 3]
But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself

Wanna love that is based on truth not just dare

Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Just say you want me, that's all it takes
Heart's gettin' torn from your mistakes

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love if you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floatin' away

[Verse 2]
Just say you love me, just for today
And don't give me time cause that's not the same
I want to feel burning flames when you say my name
I want to feel passion flow into my bones like blood through my veins

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love if you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floatin' away

[Bridge]
Won't you stay? Won't you stay?
Slowly, slowly you unfold me
But do you know me at all?
Someone told me love controls everything
But only if you know

[Bridge : Jessie Ware & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
(No-no-no-no, no, no)
If you don't wanna try
(Just try sometimes)
But all that I've been thinking of
(I just think)
Is maybe that you might
(You might)

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
And baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floatin' away

[Outro]
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay




[Verse 1]
Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Say you want me, that's all it takes
Hearts get torn from your mistakes

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
Babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's flown away

[Verse 2]
Just say you love me, just for today
Don't give me time
'Cause that's not the same
I wanna feel burning flames when you say my name
I wanna feel passion flow into my bones like blood through my veins

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
Babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's flown away

Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
Oh, but all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
Oh, babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's flown away

[Outro]
Just say you love me


[Verse 1]
Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Just say you want me, that's all it takes
Heart's gettin' torn from your mistakes

[Intro]
Your love was handmade

[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast then we talk slow
Come on over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, girl, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
Boy-oy-oy-oy
I'm in love with your body
Boy-oy-oy-oy
With your body, with your body
Boy-oy-oy-oy
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of


[Breakdown]
Hey!
Sh-sh-sh-sh-shape of
Oh
With the shape of you
With the shape of
Hey!
Sh-sh-sh-sh-shape of
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Bridge]
(Your love was handmade)
(Your love was handmade for somebody like)

[Chorus]
Boy-oy-oy-oy
I'm in love with your body
Boy-oy-oy-oy
With your body, with your body
Boy-oy-oy-oy
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of

[Outro]

I'm in love with your body
(You)


[Verse 1]
I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I'd never leave her
But now I'm ready to go
And strange as it seems
She's endless to me
She's just like paperwork
But harder to read

[Chorus]
Patience's my enemy
And loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

[Verse 2]
I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn't sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me for dear life
And blocking my way

[Chorus]
Patience's my enemy
And loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

[Outro]
And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
"Won't you stay?" She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I'll stay, anyway
Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myself




[Intro: ]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey

[Verse 1: ]
Simmer down, simmer down
They say we're too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don't swim, you'll drown
But don't move, honey

[Chorus: ]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I'm so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: ]
Let's get out, let's get out
'Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

[Chorus: ]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down
I made a mixtape straight out of '94
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I'm so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Bridge: ]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I'm so down

[Chorus: ]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down (hey, hey)
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I'm so down
Hey, hey




You were born in a small town
Always had dreams bigger than your brother, you know it
Hit the road where it forks down
Made good decisions, start from the gutter, you know it

Big city lives, fast lane living but
You never forgot your roots, oh ooh
Back in town, daddy's advice
Baby don't forget that you

Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Everyone you know
Shine a light
Shine a light

You've struggled before now
Each time you made out the other side
Pick yourself up when you fall down
Stand tall and never be afraid to cry

Big city life, same thing, different town
Darling don't forget your roots, well
Back in town, momma's advice
Baby don't forget that you

Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
With everyone you know
Shine a light, yeah
Shine a light

People love and people cry
People live and people die
And I'll never meet another life like you

Every day and every night
Teaching you wrong from right
Now you get to shine a light don't you, don't you

Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Let everybody know
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light, shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, shine a light
With everyone you know
Shine a light
Shine a light

Hey

You were born in a small town




[Verse 1]
I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You'll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you'll be floating away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

[Chorus]
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

[Verse 2]
I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss of bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make-up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

[Chorus]
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes

[Bridge]
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is I
I'm on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm-
I'm drowning in the oceans you made

[Chorus]
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes


[Ed Sheeran]
...Through the heart, baby
You watched me hit the ground
Oh, so fucking dark

[B.o.B]
Well, the story starts crazy, gnarlz Barkley
Where do I start?
You're here as I lay on the carpet

[Verse 1]
It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won't you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

[Chorus]
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!


[Verse 2]
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won't you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe


[Chorus]
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

[Bridge]
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Final Chorus]
SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won't you let me know
LOUDER!

Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

[Verse 1]
Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall

[Chorus]
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

[Verse 2]
Come on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

[Chorus]
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

[Verse 3]
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?

[Verse 1]
You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

[Chorus]
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

[Verse 2]
You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes


[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

[Chorus]
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

[Bridge]
You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

[Chorus]
'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right


[Outro]
You were just a small bump unborn
Just four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why

[Verse 1]
You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
Might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
Hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll whisper quietly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

[Chorus]
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight

[Verse 2]
You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes


[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

[Chorus]
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight

[Bridge]
You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So that I can keep you safe

[Chorus]
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right


[Outro]
You were just a small bump unborn
Just four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why

[Spoken Intro]
Now, Wembley, I've not played this song in a...
Around two years, maybe, maybe longer
But I feel like playing it today
Let's see how it goes

[Verse 1]
You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life

[Pre-Hook]
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

[Hook]
'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright


[Verse 2]
Oh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
Eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes

[Pre-Hook]
I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

[Hook]
'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright

[Bridge]
You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe


[Hook]
'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright

[Outro]
You were just a small bump unborn
Four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why



[Verse 1]
Just give me a pen and I'll write my worries
Now and again I'll try and not see that you don't care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life's bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don't care

[Hook]
And hey, I don't speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile

[Verse 2]
They've written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don't care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don't care

[Hook]


[Verse 1]
I'm filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you for all of the summer
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world, then, please, ask your mother

[Bridge]
I cannot hold your hand to watch you go
Oh, I am a liar, as you might know

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need your smile and your kiss

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...

[Post-Chorus]
Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmmmm
Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmm


[Verse 2]
I see your voice
And from my window
When it is late at night it'll show me your shadow
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world and, please, ask your mother
Now, ah-oh-ah-oh

[Bridge]
I cannot hold your hand, to watch you go
Oh, I'm a liar, as you might know

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need that smile and your kiss

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
And you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
Hm, you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...


[Bridge]
Now, these words I say mean you're so amazing
And I've noticed lately, I need you, maybe
These words I say mean you're so amazing
But I've noticed lately, I need you, maybe

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...



[Verse 1]
She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5:01 like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed and I'm way too tired
Hoodie still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high

[Chorus]
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you

[Verse 2]
When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula 1
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's cold outside again
And we're still so high

[Chorus]
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you

[Bridge]
And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like

[Chorus]
We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York, that is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio, passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Come south of the border with me

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she's wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me (Border with me)

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with me

Come south of the border with me

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name-hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Camila Cabello]
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in (Time in)
And won't stop until the angels sing

Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me (Border with me)

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that...
Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with me

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & Camila Cabello]
Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that...
Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with me

[Verse 1]
Take me with you I do declare
I love you dearly through here and there
What can I do to make you share?
What can I do to make you care?

[Chorus]
The world is harsh
I'm stuck in the dark
I'll make my mark
I've got my spark

[Verse 2]
We'd be together through bad or worse
Sending letters we shall converse
We could do better but we must first
Make amends
That depends
Will you be my friend?

[Chorus]

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till

[Verse 1]
You know just what to say, some things that scare me
I should just walk away, but I can't move my feet
The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
Oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
Hey
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don't need butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you


[Post-Chorus]
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted

[Verse 2]
You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak at my knees
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
Yeah, yeah
I was so much younger yesterday

[Chorus 2]
Hey
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don't need butterflies when you bring me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Post-Chorus 3]
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

[Verse 1]
Your heart is like an ocean
I wanna dive into you
Your love is like a river
That I'm swimming through

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Somehow I found someone who truly loves me
For all of my flaws
If you can call when I am down, then I am yours

[Chorus]
So darling do you want me? Need me?
Stay the night, stay the night
I just want you near me, believe me
Stay the night, stay the night
And all of these roads I've walked down led to you
So darling, take it easy, lay with me
Stay the night, stay the night

[Verse 2]
Your eyes are constellations
You light up the dark
Such a beautiful creation
That's just what you are


[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I finally found someone who keeps me steady
Through every storm
If you can call when I am broken, I am yours

[Chorus]
So darling do you want me? Need me?
Stay the night, stay the night
I just want you near me, believe me
Stay the night, stay the night
And all of these roads I've walked down led to you
So darling, take it easy, lay with me
Stay the night, stay the night

[Bridge]
We are made up with broken pieces of love
And all we ever really need is someone
To put the pieces back together and make us whole, again

[Chorus]
Now do you want me? Need me?
Stay the night, stay the night
I want you near me, believe me
Stay the night, stay the night
And all of these roads I've walked down led to you
So darling, take it easy, lay with me
Stay the night, stay the night

[Verse 1]
Stevie was a boy
Who turned into a man
He never had no master plan
But I knew that he could
Find right from wrong
Sing me a different song
He told me which road to take
And now I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Keep on singing
Make her life whole
Stevie you're winning
And I just feel cold
Take your life beyond the mark
You can do no wrong
When I lose my way in the dark
Keep singing your song

[Hook]
Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe
Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I should be living the dream
But I'm livin' with a security team
And that ain't gonna change, no
I got a paranoia in me
And you wouldn't believe
Everything that I seen, no
Comin' apart at the seams
And no one around me knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right
To the one I love, bring me 'round
Get me out right now (Oh-oh)
And know that I love you

[Chorus]
But I'm still learning to love myself
(To love my-, to love my-, to love my-)
I'm still learning to love myself
(To love my-, to love my-, to love my-) Yeah, yeah


[Verse 2]
I should be living the dream
But I go home and I got no self-esteem (Nope)
You think I'm swimmin' in green
But it's passed around my family tree
No man wants to really commit
Intimidated 'cause I get paid and shit
In the crowd, you're readin' my lips
But no one around me knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right
The same mistakes on and on
To all my friends, I'm sorry for
And know that I love you

[Chorus]
But I'm still learning (I'm still learning) to love myself
(To love my-, to love my-, to love my-) Yeah, yeah
I'm still learning (I'm still learning) to love myself (To love myself)
(To love my-, to love my-, to love my-) Yeah, yeah (Oh, oh)
Oh, I try and I try to remember sometimes
If I breathe, it's alright, but some things don't change
I'm still learning (I'm still learning) to love myself (To love myself)
(To love my-, to love my-, to love myself) Yeah, yeah


[Bridge]
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right
To the one I love, bring me 'round
Get me out right now (And the ones I love)
And the ones I love

[Chorus]
I'm still learning to love myself
(To love my-, to love my-, to love my-) Yeah, yeah
I'm still learning (I'm still learning) to love myself (To love myself)
(To love my-, to love my-, to love my-, ooh)
And I try and I try to remember sometimes
If I breathe, it's alright, but some things don't change
I'm still learning (I'm still learning) to love myself (I'm still learning)
To love myself, tryna love myself

[Outro]
I'm still learning to love myself

Ching man down and i piss on the wound
You man dont know what I do for the food
Dont talk sh*t, i'm not in the mood
Keep food in my gullet, not talking Ruud
Free my man cuz they're stuck in a can
Bro came home and he came with a plan
Try get loud and i baptise man
Man got hit with a baseball bat
Taking the piss say I look like a cat

[Verse 1]
You know I've been taking some time
And I've been keeping to myself (self)
I had my eyes up on the prize
Ain't watching anybody else
But your love, it hit me hard, girl
Yeah, you're bad for my health
I love the cards that I've been dealt
Do you feel the same as well?

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I used to be in 1D (now I'm out, free)
People want me for one thing (that's not me)
I'm not changing the way that I (used to be)
I just wanna have fun and (get rowdy)
One Coke and Bacardi (sippin' lightly)
When I walk inside the party (girls on me)
F1 type Ferrari (6 gear speed)
Girl, I love it when your body (grinds on me)
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
You know I love it when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me, baby
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
But only you can dance with me
So put your hands on my body
And swing that round for me, baby (swing)
You know I love it when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love when you hit the ground, girl (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love, when you hit the ground


[Verse 2]
You know that since the day I met you
Yeah, you swept me off my feet
You know that I don't need no money
When your love is beside me
Yeah, you opened up my heart
And then you threw away the key
Girl, now it's just you and me
And you don't care 'bout where I've been

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I used to be in 1D (now I'm out, free)
People want me for one thing (that's not me)
I'm not changing the way that I (used to be)
I just wanna have fun (and get rowdy) (ooh)
One Coke and Bacardi (sippin' lightly)
When I walk inside the party (girls on me)
F1 type Ferrari (6 gear speed)
Girl, I love it when your body (grinds on me)
Ooh

[Chorus]
You know I love it when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me, baby

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Another night, another club
Another room, a new one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
But I'm lonely, in LA

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
That one night stand, could just be the one, yeah

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Another night, another day
Another city, another plane
Another heart I'm gonna break
Another mili on the cardiae
A young girl my heart broke, so I don't wanna get close
I don't know why you're not enough

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
But I ended up being one anyway
Man you can never change me
This is my world, I run this city and I'm in my own lane
Sometimes being solo is the way to
'Cause I love the way I get some
But you never know though cause maybe you
Could just be the one, ayy

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely

My love is a flickering candle, in the dark




[Intro: Brandon]
Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time, and
I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room

[Verse 1: Zion, Edwin]
Darling, I've been working all week (yeah)
I've got so much on my plate, always saying "poor me"
Although my boss is an a-hole, that's when you call me
Said you've been making a plan to hit the road with me  (yeah)
I'll pick you up after and-

[Pre-Chorus: Edwin]
We'll hit the coast on the late night
Make love 'til daylight
I love it when you play with my hair
You know it feels so nice
And I'll do what you like
Naked in the moonlight
We don't care if we are broke when love is all we own, I'm singin'

[Chorus: All & Brandon]
Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time, and
I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh)
Oh, I will spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Austin, Zion]
I'm singin', "hey babe"
Two jobs on minimum wage
Although the rent's late
Still got a smile on my face (ha-ha-ha-ha)
We ain't got the sunshine
But we got hearts in our chest
To feel a love like this
Stronger than anyone else

[Pre-Chorus: Edwin, Zion & All]
We'll hit the drive-thru, like Lil' Wayne
We ain't got no platinum chains
But hand-me-downs are all the rage (aye!)
So let me spend this pocket change
We'll drink beer like it's champagne (champagne)
Stay out kissin' in the rain
We don't care if we are broke when love is all we own, I'm singin'

[Chorus: All & Zion]
Baby, I ain't got no money (I ain't got no money)
All I got is time, and
I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they (yeah) pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (uh)
Oh, I will spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge: Nick, Brandon, Both]
Oh, I know baby we ain't got no money
All we got is love, but
I know that can see us through
It might sound crazy
But why do we need sunshine?
When we can stay and sip warm beer
While holed up in a room
That's how we spend my summer like (on you, babe)

[Chorus: All & Brandon]
Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is (hey) time, and
I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (uh)
Oh I will spend my summer on you
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh I will spend my summer on you


[Intro: Brandon]
Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend  that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room

[Verse 1: Zion, Edwin]
Darling I've been working all week (yeah)
I've got so much on my plate
Always saying "poor me"
Although my boss is an a-hole
That's when you call me
Said you've been making a plan
To hit the road with me  (yeah)
I'll pick you up after and-

[Pre-Chorus: Edwin]
We'll hit the coast on the late night
Make love 'til daylight
I love it when you play with my hair
You know it feels so nice
And I'll do what you like
Naked in the moonlight
We don't care if we are broke
When love is all we own, I'm singin'


[Chorus: All & Brandon]
Baby, I ain't got no money (hey)
All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh)
Oh, I will spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Austin, Zion]
I'm singin' hey babe
Two jobs on minimum wage
Although the rent's late
Still got a smile on my face (ha-ha-ha)
We ain't got the sunshine
But we got hearts in our chest
To feel the love like this
Stronger than anyone else

[Pre-Chorus: Edwin, Zion]
We'll hit the drive-thru, like Lil' Wayne
We ain't got no platinum chains
But hand-me-downs are all the rage (aye!)
So let me spend this pocket change
We'll drink beer like it's champagne (champagne)
And stay out kissin' in the rain
We don't care if we are broke
When love is all we own, I'm singin'


[Chorus: All & Zion]
Baby, I ain't got no money (I ain't got no money)
All I got is time
And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they (yeah) pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (uh)
Oh, I will spend my summer on
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge: Nick & Brandon]
Oh, I know baby we ain't got no money
All we got is love
But I know that can see us through
It might sound crazy
But why do we need sunshine?

[Chorus: All & Brandon]
Baby, I ain't got no money (I ain't got no money)

And I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
And I'll spend my summer on

[Verse: The Game]
... Kings and queens, [?]
Some people there when we fall, some people leave us
I got my Dre beats on, listening to Yeezy's
Thinking back to the day

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I met you in the summertime
And you were [?] by the winter snow
And it's been so long...




[Verse 1]
You're not her, though I try to see you differently
I tow the line, you see, I'm searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes, and I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her

[Pre-Hook]
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear

[Hook]
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

[Verse 2]
She was mine
I was hers and all that's in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be

[Pre-Hook]
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear

[Hook]
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

[Bridge]
Don't drop me in, it's not my turn
If you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scarred and left me, like a sunburn
Don't drop me in, it's not my turn
And if you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scar and leave me, like a sunburn

[Hook]
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you


You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I'm searching for what used to be mine

I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you

She was mine
I was hers
And all that's in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be


If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear,oh

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
If you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn

Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scarred and left me
Like a sunburn


We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you

[Verse 1]
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face


[Pre-Chorus]
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Outro/Chorus]
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person that I have become
Spread your wing
And I know that when God took you back he said Hallelujah
You're home

He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Outro]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
Ya got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Alleluia, you're home"


[Verse 1]

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yuh, everything's so down right now

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made, memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when your down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces but it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]

You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, everything seems so depressing
I can't believe my grandma passed
There's nothing I can do about it
So I guess I'll just sit and cry, uh


[Verse 3: ASAP Rocky]
My mum is ill and passed away
I am so very sad, her death is out of my control
I can't get her out of my damn head
I think about her and it just makes me cry every day

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Yeah, damn, everybody's drunk and sad
Grandma passed away
We're gonna go to bed sad
And will have to be sad all the time, uh

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar + Kanye West and ASAP Rocky]
Yeah, we're all sad



Oh! I'm in pieces
It's tearing me up but I know
A life we love is a life that's been lived

So I'd sing Hallelujah
You are an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you've been there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say hallelujah you are home

I fluffed the pillows, made the bed, stake the chairs up
Folded your night gowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek and wiped a tear from the side of my face

Oh! I'm in pieces
It's tearing me up but I know
A life we love is a life that's been lived

So I'd sing Hallelujah
You are an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you've been there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say hallelujah you are home

Oh! I'm in pieces
It's tearing me up but I know
A life we love is a life that's been lived

So I'd sing Hallelujah
You are an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you've been there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say hallelujah you are home

Message:
You know when things happen to people
We tend to ask God questions
Because we feel We're the only ones going through this pain
We feel we're the only ones suffering
But this is just a test
If you can go through it
Life will be better for you

Oftentimes people lose a loved one and ask God questions
We shouldn't be doing that, just move on
That's not the end of your life
Things will happen, you'll love again
People will come for you
Life will be Good

[Verse 1]
Well how ya doing darling
How you getting on
Any horses running
Worth betting on
How's the weather down there
I hope you're keeping warm

[Verse 2]
How you feeling sweetheart
Are you moving on
Are you sleeping ok
Or do the nights go on and on
I hope you're eating well
I hope you're staying strong

[Chorus]
'Cos I'm fine and then I'm not
I'm spinning 'round and I can't stop
I can't do this alone
For time flies then it's so slow
I'm up and down like a yoyo
I can't do it on my own
And I've tried and I can't pull the sword from the stone

[Verse 3]
How are your Mum and Dad
How's your Brother too
My folks are holding up
My sister's pulling through
And both the cats say hi
I know they miss you too

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm fine, then I'm not
I'm spinning 'round and I can't stop
I can't do this alone
For time flies then it's so slow
I'm up and down like a yoyo
I can't do it on my own
'Cause I've tried and I can't pull the sword from the stone

[Chorus]
Because I'm fine, then I'm not
I'm spinning 'round and I can't stop
I can't do this alone
Time flies then it's so slow
I'm up and down like a yoyo
I can't do it on my own
See I've tried and I can't pull the sword from the stone




[Verse 1]
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now

[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

[Verse 2]
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, "Everything that happens is from now on"
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now

[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No, I'll take it back now

[Verse 3]
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now

[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

[Verse 4]
My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
But the other 10 percent, it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow
Igh!




I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
'Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now

Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
This is like claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now

Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
And take it back now

Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally

Very superstitious, writings on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past

Believing things that you don't understand

Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

I wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

But ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way
Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way
Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London

[Verse 3: Stormzy & Ed Sheeran]
Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, "That's just the way things go"
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)
So take me back to London
So take me back to London



[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)

[Verse 3: Jaykae]
Birmingham, 0121 stand up!
You better tell them the hooligan's here
My team can't lose when I'm here
Outside, quick twos and a beer
You see me when I choose to appear
Just paid a few bag for my carpet
Blud, take off your shoes when you're here
Yo, I can turn boos into cheers
Tiptronic man cruise through the gears
Rep blues when I'm here
It's Brum
Fam, are you dumb?
Red red wine or you want a redrum
You can be forty, you don't wanna war me
End of story, you're gunna get spun
Man smoke weed 'til my whole head's numb
Don't talk greaze cos I won't take none
VIP in my own section
Wild, wild west with the old western, it's Brum!

[Verse 4: Aitch]
Old school raving, back to scally
And the AP, packed with gally
Take me back to Manny
Blacked out Roll full of yack and maggy
And a S3 boot full of packs of Cali
Hit the booth, man, slap it snappy
Bap bap, that's that, track wrapped, I'm happy
Some man are blessed, some are bad and trappy
Gets cold up north, pack your hat and trackie'
Huh, man was made to set pace
Young Aitch, I came for first place
Made a change to get paid
Fam, I stayed in my lane and came with that flame
Day to day we on stage
Make my K, then I skate and catch the next plane
Baking up when I wake
Rake it up, get it saved
It's make it or break

[Verse 5: Jaykae & Aitch]
It's make it or break
Human man, still make a mistake
Mad now Aitch just made a mixtape
Told Jaykae to make the next eight
We 'bout to set pace, I can't get about no more it gets bait
And I don't get head no more, I get face
She don't want him no more, she wants Jay
And she don't want me no more, she wants Aitch (Aye)
Jaykae, make a lot of P (Uh)
Go straight there if that's where I've got to be
Wait, stop, pop my collar, I'm a G
5 million minimum, what I wanna see
I ain't in it for the money, put that to bed
Tell mumsy that I'm on a track with Ed
Aim this one at your head
Write bars with a pen on a pad when the battery's dead

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Aitch & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (0161)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (0121)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (London City)
So take me back to London (Woo)
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)
So take me back to London

[Verse 1]
Mmm, yeah you burned me again
Well, I don't wanna know where you've been
Mmm, how is your new best friend?
Do you know I will treat you like them?
And I know...

[Chorus]
You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

[Verse 2]
Apologies for the way I've been
I couldn't wash you off my skin
No I, I couldn't live without you
Mmm, tears and eyes can dry
But I know I'm burning like the wire in light bulbs
It could be in the way you bleed me
And I know

[Chorus]
You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

[Bridge]
See these scars leaving blood on my little white dress?
Beating heart screaming out now

[Chorus]
You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

[Outro]
You're under my skin and running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way you loved me
I guess you had to leave a tattoo to remind me




[Verse 1]
Mmm, yeah you burned me again
Well, I don't wanna know where you've been
Mmm, how is your new best friend?
And do you know I will treat you like him?
And I know

[Chorus]
You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

[Verse 2]
Apologies for the way I've been
I couldn't wash you off my skin
No I, I couldn't live without you
Mmm, tears and eyes can dry
But I know I'm burning like the wire in light bulbs
It could be in the way you bleed me
And I know

[Chorus]
You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo

[Outro]
Under my skin and running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way you loved me
I guess you had to leave a tattoo to remind me




[Verse 1]
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

[Verse 2]
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

[Bridge]
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

[Outro]
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment I knew you, Beth




White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste

Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the class A team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes

Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Cool girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the class A team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

And they say
She's in the class A team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man

It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
To fly
For angels to die


White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

But she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upperhand
Go mad for a couple of grams

[Intro]
Hello, everyone! Yay, we're so near the time for Ed! It's so exciting! Woohoo! Um... just wanted to say a couple more things: just remember that we are filming this for a DVD that you guys are going to be able to buy and tonight is being recorded for a live EP that you guys will also be able to buy so... I think we'd all agree that we're all a part of something really special because we're going to be able to take tonight home in a few weeks (cheering) So yeah, big honor for us all to be here and... I just want to personally say a big thank-you to Ed for asking me to um-- host tonight because it's just amazing and I think he's fantastic and I feel honored to be here. So that's it! It's time to welcome the fantastic Ed Sheeran to the stage. Make some noise!

[Intro]
Yeah, he's messed up a couple times
But he's my glass of cherry wine
And I drink and I drink 'til I'm drunk off of him
I'm in love
*Gasp*, he just hit me up to come over
He said what?

[Verse 1]
Momma said, "Always be kind, girl" (Girl, what's on your mind?)
But I got something I should say (Say it, girl), uh
Boy, I'm sick and done and tired (There's something on my mind)
I'm not yours to manipulate, uh-huh (Tell him girl, tell hi )

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh boy, hold your tongue, I don't want no 'pology
'Cause we both know you're thinking wit' was under your jeans
Sent your friends over to tell me you're missing me
But I don't care, so tell that boy that I am fine

[Chorus]
I don't care about the day he decided to leave
I won't be there when he tells another lie so
I'm gon' use all of my words for weapons
'Cause the boy don't care about me, lemme say it again, now babe
I don't care about the way he thinks it's so sweet (Ah)
All that sugar cone gon' be bad for me tomorrow (Ah)
I'm gon' use all of my words for weapons
'Cause the boy don't care about me

[Verse 2]
All my girls inside the place now (Say we don't need no man)
Wonder why we switch sides sometimes (We got this)
Wipe that good look off your face (Say we got better plans)
Ooh, you better not act surprised (For real)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh boy, hold your tongue, I don't want no 'pology
'Cause we both know you're thinking wit' was under your jeans
Sent your friends over to tell me you're missing me
But I don't care so tell that boy that I am fine

[Chorus]
I don't care about the day he decided to leave
I won't be there when he tells another lie so
I'm gon' use all of my words for weapons
'Cause the boy don't care about me
Lemme, lemme say it again, baby
I don't care about the way he thinks he's so sweet (Ah)
All that sugar cone gon' be bad for me tomorrow (Ah)
I'm gon' use all of my words for weapons
'Cause the boy don't care about me

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, don't care about me
That's fine with me, babe
You don't care about me
And that's fine with me
Fine with me, fine with me (Don't care about)
It is what I need, oh (That's fine with)
Don't care about, care about
Care about, care about me, oh

[Chorus]
I don't care about the day he decided to leave
I won't be there when he tells another lie so (Oh, yeah, yeah)
I'm gon' use all of my words for weapons
'Cause the boy don't care about me
(He don't care about me and I just know it)
I don't care about the way he thinks it's so sweet (Ah)
All that sugar cone gon' be bad for me tomorrow (Ah)
I'm gon' use all of my words for weapons
'Cause the boy don't care about me

[Outro]
Girl, that's old, we're done with that




[Verse 1]
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

[Pre-Chorus]
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)

[Chorus]
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two

[Verse 2]
The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)

[Chorus]
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two

[Bridge]
And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along

[Pre-Chorus]
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

[Chorus]
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two


[Verse 1]
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
And sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
My hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Don't control what I'm into

[Pre-Chorus]
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

[Chorus]
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two

[Verse 2]
The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
So I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
And the shop across the road
Fulills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow


[Pre-Chorus]
And London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

[Chorus]
Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two

[Bridge]
And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this
To keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I
Need to move along

[Verse 3]
I'm from a city where the rain won't cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can't resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won't erase me
But I can't help to see how this dark city changed me
It's all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London's my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me


[Pre-Chorus]
And London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

[Chorus]
Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two

[Verse 1]
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Can't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

[Pre-Chorus]
London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home

[Chorus]
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

[Bridge]
And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

[Rap Verse]
I'm from a city where the rain won't cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can't resort to arrogance with white lies

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat

[Chorus]
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

That was fun!



Look its funny how the city where the Queen sleeps
Still ain't got clean streets
But there ain't a day when she ain't got clean sheets
Homeless people roam with needles and
You've got to pay tax to afford a vehicle
Tube fare doubles up every two years
And the buses upstairs are a no go area
Man are like 'Pass me your mobile, here me now'
And with the crunch of the credit
You can't get a roof over your head
You're stuck in the debit
But every single month they come for the debit
Direct action, if you don't play they
Dive and snatch things and it don't say that
Now equipped fear 'cause a victim of inflation
The black letters turned red and they been patient
And now six years rent has just been wasted



I'm from a city where the rain won't cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can't resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won't erase me
But I can't help to see how this dark city changed me
It's all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London's my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me



Hey, look, I'm from a city full of jammed up traffic, night buses
All-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night lovers
That knew when to pay rent and stay in their apartment
Talented buskers playing that guitar riff
The church pastor's still praying for answers
Way too much congestion, they're charging
Way too much for petrol, I'm laughing
But there ain't no funny side
It's like winter all year, there ain't no summer time
Stone Island jacket, keep warm
And all phone lines are tapped, you've been warned
And also mind the gap and keep calm
Cause one wrong move on the train, big beard
And it's gunshots, two in your brain, it's weird
So as much as I'm in love with this city
Just maybe I've had enough of the city




[Verse 1: Scorcher]
Hey, look, it's funny how the city where the Queen sleeps still ain't got clean streets
But there ain't a day when she ain't got clean sheets
And homeless people roll with needles
And you've gotta pay tax when you own a vehicle
Tube fare doubles up every two years
And the buses upstairs is a no-go area
The man are like "pass me your mobile, hear me now"
And chew the crunch on the credit
You can't get a roof over your head, you're stuck in the debit
But every single month they come for the debit
Direct action, if you don't play they
Dive in, snatch things and they don't say
Now the crib's vacant, victim of inflation
The black letters turn red cause they've been patient
And that six years' rent has just been wasted, wasted, wasted

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
And my lungs hurt and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?

[Verse 1]
Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true, I kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But [fuck] it
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot?
I think not

[Chorus]
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

[Chorus]
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

[Verse 3]
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing [Alice]?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change [shit]
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

[Chorus]
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore


(Verse 1:)
No...
I don't hate you
But I don't love you
All those times you didn't come through
It was always like I was supposed to be perfect
You're making me nervous
My anxiety, you're making it worse and I feel like I'm the worst
And I'm working
Tryna get better for you, but are you worth it
Tryna get better for you, but do you deserve it
More or less I think I'm done with this one
I wanna stay but I wanna run
God damn I hope you had fun
Cause it's come to the point where I-

(Chorus:)
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I want want you no, anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no, anymore

(Verse 2:)
You were perfect in every way to me
It was you I never could wait to see
But now that you're away from me, I feel like I escaped, I'm free
The love I had for you is gone
And everything i thought was true about you were wrong
I was caught up on you for so long...
Now the feelings for you, I dismantled
Don't really know how much more i could handle
I guess I was never the man for you
Even though I always lended a hand to you
Now I'm probably a back up man to you
Probably a back up plan for you
But for now you got another man to use
And god damn you lose you ever living mind over things that are irrelevant
Holding grudges over things I said that I never meant
Never let me hear end of it
You turned into a pessimist
I don't feel like addressing this
Turned me into a wreck, sh-


(Chorus:)
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no, anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no, anymore

(Verse 3:)
I know I made my mistakes
Some I wish I didn't make
But the biggest mistake falling for every one of your games
Neither of us were perfect
They way we hurt each other we didn't deserve it
And at the end I kinda felt like you weren't even worth it
I'd forget it all if I could
I never lied to you, look
I'm not your puppet don't string me around like you think you should
Now i'm just gonna pull up my hood
And i won't even glance at you, look
It destroyed us both, i think it's better if we stay distant for good
Screw your apologies and getting on to me just talk to me
It'd likely just be easier for me leave
Cause I don't believe in miracles when it comes to this
Cause now there's not a single thing about you that I really miss
I don't think we were meant to be
I don't think that we're enemies
It just ended really badly and I wanna say I'm sorry
I'm sorry that everything we planned didn't work out
I'm sorry it all just and derailed we're going down this route
"I'm sorry" is something you'll no longer hear from my mouth..


(Chorus:)
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no anymore...
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no, anymore
(Oh yeahhh...)

[Verse 1]
Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

[Verse 2]
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

[Verse 3]
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all



[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Sitting with you in a dark room
Warmed by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope I say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

[Verse 2: Faith Hill]
I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter'd be Rose
Son, it'd be Ryan

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're here by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life




[Verse 1]
Pass me a drink
You say it's gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile

[Hook]
You're wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don't reach
Your smile
You're holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You're eating your fears
In a cigarette
You've waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

[Verse 2]
I've taken the blow
It's all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no 'see you later'

[Hook]


[Verse 1]
I keep my hopes and dreams inside you amongst these other things
My mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering
Never been known as my government name
My foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain
And now you sit before me, with a folder holding my story
You're my saviour with nothing on me but hope and glory
And surely, you'll never ignore me
'cos when the court came the court date was made to disappear for me
You think you understand me, but never what I went through
But you were never meant to, I won't hold it against you
I take a ball point pen to play dot to dot
With the cigarette burns etched in my forearms
Forget me not, never let me stop, you'll just sit and watch
It's your job to be patient so you'll let me off
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyes

[Hook]
And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleep's the only thing I want to take me away, away

[Verse 2]
Okay session's over time to get back to the classroom
I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard too
You told me I should try my best but guess what, I still find this trigonometry a head fuck
Constantly told I won't pass my GCSEs
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em
Lately classmates think I'm crazy
Turn up daily resembling Bill Bailey
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it
Without new clothes or shower it's hard to do so
After school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes
But they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyes


[Hook]

Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there

I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I'd find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again

In Milltown there's a pub
It's there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I'll banish lonesome thoughts
But they'll return again


I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I'll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog

Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there

[Snippet]
Yeah, well the summer time is coming
As her warm breath starts to blow
She will for the spring like she's a domino
By his sides, she begins to glow

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are



When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me - I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmmmmm...)
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh ohh)

La la la la la la la la lo-ud

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart

But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

This year's love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waiting on my own
Too long
And when you hold me like you do
It feels so right, oh now
I start to forget how my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on
Turning circles and time again
Cut like a knife, oh now
If ya love me got to know
For sure
Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet sweet lies, oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul
When ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This year's love it better last
This year's love it better last
Cause who's to worry if our hearts get torn
When that hurt get thrown
Don't ya know this life goes on
Won't ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This year's love it better last
This year's love it better last



[Intro: Bizarre & Ed Sheeran]
Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
It's one of those kinda nights

[Verse 1: Eminem, Ed Sheeran, & Bizarre]
Yes, this beat's takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
And takin' her straight back to the Motel-8
Yeah, Bizarre's tryna get a lap dance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (Ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like "Goddamn"
She's like "That's harassment," I'm like "Yeah, and?" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That's the best ass I've seen in a while
We should be datin', she's from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy (Since an addy)
She said "Fuck off" and threw her liquor at me
It's one of those kinda nights
Then I said, I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights

[Verse 2: Eminem]
This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her et cetera
Had her like, "Oh my God
My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em"
I said, "Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah (Haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?"
She said, "No, I'm bi"
She said, "Are you drunk?," I said, "No, I'm high
I'm checkin' out the chick," she said, "So am I"
"What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at?"
She said, "Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back"
Then I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda-

[Verse 3: Eminem]
OMG
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Said she wants to go with me
I said, "Go with you where?" She said, "Out"
I said, "I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me"
Walk her out to the parkin' lot, here comes Da Brigade
Turn like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, "Let's pull over," she said, "No problemo"
Windows are dark tint, roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're ho'in
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no one
I'm high and you're bi, I'm comin', you're goin'

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights




[Verse 1]
I won't wear makeup on Thursday
I'm sick of covering up
I'm tired of feeling so broken
I'm tired of falling in love
Sometimes I'm shy and I'm anxious
Sometimes I'm down on my knees
Sometimes I try to embrace all my insecurities
So I won't wear makeup on Thursday
'Cause who I am is enough

[Pre-Chorus]
And there are many things that I could change so slightly
But why would I succumb to something so unlike me?
I was always taught to just be myself
Don't change for anyone

[Chorus]
I wanna laugh, I wanna cry
Don't want these tears inside my eyes, yeah
Don't wanna wake up and feel insecure
I wanna sing, I wanna dance
I wanna feel love inside my hands again
I just wanna feel beautiful

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh I-
Oh-oh-oh, oh I-
Oh-oh-oh, I just wanna feel beautiful

[Verse 2]
I'll wear my sweatpants on Thursday
And I'll drink sloe gin from a can
I'll build my own independence
I don't always need a man
You know sometimes I feel lonely
Could do with the company
Oh, I get high when I'm down
But you know that's alright with me
So I will do nothing on Thursday
Sit alone and be

[Pre-Chorus]
And there are many things that I could change so slightly
But why would I succumb to something so unlike me?
I was always taught to just be myself
Don't change for anyone

[Chorus]
I wanna laugh, I wanna cry
Don't want these tears inside my eyes, yeah
Don't wanna wake up and feel insecure
I wanna sing, I wanna dance
I wanna feel love inside my hands again
I just wanna feel beautiful

[Verse 1: Jess Glynne]
I won't wear makeup on Thursday
I'm sick of coverin' up
I'm tired of feelin' so broken
I'm tired of fallin' in love
Sometimes I'm shy and I'm anxious
Sometimes I'm down on my knees
Sometimes I try to embrace all my insecurities
So I won't wear makeup on Thursday
'Cause who I am is enough

[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
I let my hair down on Thursday
And I don't care who's watching me (Who's watching me)
I'm gonna look in the mirror
And I'm gonna love what I see (See)
So tired of feeling afraid of what they might think, what they'll say
So tired of all my own doubts and getting in my own way
I let my hair down on Thursday
Let it fall, let it be (Let it fall, let it be)
Oh, let it be

[Pre-Chorus: Jess Glynne & with H.E.R.]
And there are many things that I could change so slightly
But why would I succumb to something so unlike me?

[Verse 1]
Don't close your eyes, dear, don't you be nervous
You put this whole damn place in a spell
I see your friends here, and some of them jealous
'Cause they know this love don't come off the shelf
I saw your mother, she looked so beautiful
Remember when she didn't think I would stay?
But all of those late night broke as hell dinners
Led us to where we're standing today

[Chorus]
I'm feeling time move slow
I'm seeing faces glow
None of them shine as bright
As you tonight
I'm hearing voices hush
There's no one else but us
Darling, there's so much love
Under these lights
If it's okay, let's just have the time of our lives

[Verse 2]
I saw your father, he wouldn't talk to me
Till he could tell that I was here to stay
But all of those awkward short conversations
Led us to where we're standing today


[Chorus]
I'm feeling time move slow
I'm seeing faces glow
None of them shine as bright
As you tonight
I'm hearing voices hush
There's no one else but us
Darling, there's so much love
Under these lights
If it's okay, let's just have the time of our lives

[Bridge]
Time of our lives
Time of our lives
Time of our lives

[Chorus]
I'm feeling time move slow
I'm seeing faces glow
None of them shine as bright
As you tonight
I'm hearing voices hush
There's no one else but us
Darling, there's so much love
Under these lights
If it's okay, let's just have the time
Let's just have the time of our lives

[Verse 1]
I love the dimples in the small of your back
The way they're speaking to me just like that
Red wine made my imagination run
Oh, I can taste it on the tip of my tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang on to anything you can hold

[Chorus]
It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

[Verse 2]
Girl, believe me when I say it's true
Nobody makes me feel the way you do
Well, I love you from the morning 'til the setting sun, yeah
I can taste the ocean on the tip of my tongue


[Pre-Chorus]
Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang onto anything you can hold

[Chorus]
It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

[Bridge]
It's a long way down
It's a long way down

[Chorus]
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue


[Outro]
I wanna love you 'til my days are done
I wanna tell you that I think that you're the one
Oh girl, you know when it's all said and done
Everything about you's on the tip of my tongue



[Verse 1: Strife Kid]
Together if we burn it may be the only
Way out of this mess but it's going to be hard for us to
Go through fire, now we're going through flames higher
And their are flames higher up than twenty feet up in the air, yeah baby girl
And I had to call up my friend Ed Sheeran to sing this hook now
I know, he's made it and I'm still waitin' but one day we will be reignin'

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
If this is to end in fire then we should burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side high

[Verse 2: Strife Kid]
If this is to end in fire then the fire burned us, it really hurts, ow!
But we got through it, with the, flames up
All higher than the top of mountains, just sitting there
Every moment raising higher and now it's over that twenty feet
That it was originally and now I'm just a stack of bones
Along with you but tomorrow can be a better day than ever
Now that we

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
If this is to end in fire then we should burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side high

[Verse 3: Strife Kid]
We are in a better place right now
There is no need to sob and cry
We will always be by your sides in your hearts
Until your time comes your way but now there is no need to worry
Even though we're not with you, we are still in a better place
But it kills me to know you still feel over me
It kills me to know you all cry for me
It makes me feel like I left this Earth as a legend
We are now in a better place, better phases in our ways
And lived the life to the fullest it could possibly be, it's done now

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
If this is to end in fire then we should burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side high


I can see the city life
From where I stand on the top floor
But I'm not sure if I'm dead
I raise my hands to the clouds
To check if heaven is with me now
Cause the devil's in my bed
And she won't love me like she could
She won't hold me like you would

I bid this city goodnight
And coloured street lamps spark my eyes
When it's quiet I'll go
And say my sweetest goodbye
Under billboards of fast food and mobile phones
Cause they won't treat me like they should
Cause they don't need me like you would

My toes curl, clutched to the edge
I'm filled up with regret
Could you forgive me yet?
Would you know if I fell
From this hotel?



[Intro]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said

[Pre-Chorus]
So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke

[Chorus]
Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go

[Verse 2]
It's not enough, to say I want ya
Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt
I had have just been questioning it

[Pre-Chorus]
If I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke

[Chorus]
Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be

[Bridge]
All of my bones, they scream I'm right
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling my soul would heal

[Outro]
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the wrong
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, how long
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go

I won't lie to you
I know she's just not right for you

But I see it on your face
When you say that she's the one that you want
And you're spending all this time wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

Than she can
Give you all that you deserve
Just, take a chance

Better than she can

What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Amy]
Oooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while
Haven't I

Found love, but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along

I'm thinking baby you
Are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you

Fell for ones who weren't how they appear
Trapped up on a tightrope
Now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

Every time I see you, baby, I get lost
If I'm dreaming please don't wake me up (don't wake me up)

Every time I'm with you I fall more in love
Now I'm right here by your side
Everything feels right
Since you came along

Are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
We're
Fallin' all in

You

Trapped up on a tightrope
Now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you



[Verse 1: Daniel Seavey & All & Jonah Marais]
I don't want a girl who gets a car for her sweet sixteen
Or spends a stack of dollar bills on a limousine
I want a girl who takes the bus and who wears baggy jeans
Rockin' Nike Airs, what the hell are Louboutins?
Don't want no fake tan, short skirt, daddy's money, don't work
Shop until you drop on the town
I want a smart girl, stronger than her father
Someone who will laugh at tryna fit in the crowd (ah-ow, ow)

[Pre-Chorus: Jonah Marais]
And all we used to dream about
Is getting rich and getting out
Move to the nicer part of town
Where we'd have numbers on our house
It took a while to figure out
What type of girl that I'm about
Who brings the real man out of me, yah

[Chorus: Zach Herron & All & Jack Avery]
I don't really want no trust fund baby
I like my women independent

Save your money, don't spend it
And I say to people, "That's my lady"
And we don't need nothing e-e-e-else

[Verse 2: Corbyn Besson & Jonah Marais]
Don't want a girl who takes selfies, want her makeup free
Don't want no mean girl lady, a pink prom queen
I want a girl who climbs trees, always dirt on her jeans
Her daddy told her how to fix cars, maybe she could fix me
I want a throwback kid who loves Missy Elliott
Who for my birthday, makes a mixtape and puts it on cassette
Want a girl with common sense, who's dripping in confidence
Don't wanna die to get rich but she love 50 Cent (ah-ow, ow)

[Pre-Chorus: Jonah Marais]
And all we used to dream about

And we don't need nothing e-e-e-lse


[Post-Chorus]
I don't want no, baby, baby, ow-ow, baby, baby, ow-ow
Ow, baby, ow, baby, baby, baby, ow-ow
Baby, baby, ow-ow, baby, baby, ow-ow
E-e-e-else, baby, baby (I don't want no)
Ow-ow, baby, baby, ow-ow
Baby, baby, ow-ow, baby, baby, ow-ow
E-e-e-else, baby, baby

[Verse 2: Corbyn Besson & Jonah Marais]
I don't want a girl who take selfies, want her makeup free
Don't want no mean girl lady, a pink prom queen
I want a girl who climbs trees, always dirt on her jeans
Her daddy told her how to fix cars, maybe she could fix me
I want a throwback kid who loves Missy Elliot
Who for my birthday, makes a mixtape and puts it on cassette
Want a girl with common sense, who's dripping in confidence
Don't wanna die to get rich but she love Fifty Cent (ah-ow, ow)

[Pre-Chorus: Jonah Marais]
And all we used to dream about
Is getting rich and getting out
Move to the nicer part of town
Where we'd have numbers on our house
It took a while to figure out
What type of girl that I'm about
Who brings the real man out of me, yah


[Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery]
I don't really want no trust fund baby
I like my women independent
And I say to people, "That's my lady"
And we don't need nothing e-e-e-lse
I don't want no trust fund baby
Save your money, don't spend it
And I say to people, "That's my lady"
And we don't need nothing e-e-e-lse

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want no, baby, baby, ow-ow, baby, baby, ow-ow
Ow, baby, ow, baby, baby, baby, ow-ow
Baby, baby, ow-ow, baby, baby, ow-ow
E-e-e-else, baby, baby (I don't want no)
Ow-ow, baby, baby, ow-ow
Baby, baby, ow-ow, baby, baby, ow-ow
E-e-e-else, baby, baby

[Outro: Jack Avery & Jonah Marais & Zach Herron]
I don't want no
I don't want no trust fund baby (no, I don't want me)
I just want me a proper lady (no, I don't want me)
I don't want no trust fund baby (no, I don't want me)
I just want me a proper lady (no, I don't want me)
I don't want no trust fund baby (no, I don't want me)
I just want me a proper lady (no, I don't want me)
I don't want no trust fund baby (no, I don't want me)
No, I don't want me

Sing the song Celestial Man
Shake the thing your mother gave ya!
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
I'd wager that you're gonna take it
Make you fight nature, born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark, put on the light
And he said 'You and your big cheeks have got me'
Along with 'Disarm' and 'Flooded Quarry'
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black
You make the room's hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain't wrong
He's got me singing to 'Amerikan Folk Song'
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Don't talk, only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom
JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand
This ain't no fake, it's music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout 'Wow!'
How did they even have the guts to do it ?
If your name's Nizlopi, then there ain't much to it
'Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around now

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla Sign]
Boy she got some ass on her
Nice bag on her
Red bottoms on her heels
She smoke weed, pop pills
That's my little bitch, I got her nails done
24 inch weave hair long
She only fucking me 'cause I'm nigga rich
Plus I back call him a bitch
But I really like it, how she ride it
I told her put that thing on vibrate
She go irate, make it gyrate
She don't suck dick, type of bitch I hate
Oh, shit that I hate
That's the type of shit that I hate
Type of bitch make you take her on ten dates
Then she give you the pussy and the shit weak (damn)

[Hook 1: Ty Dolla Sign (Fabulous)]
Type of shit that I hate
Yeah, type of shit that I hate
Woah, that's the type of shit that I hate
(Now I ain't gon' hate her but)
Woah, type of shit that I hate
(Yeah, I hate when people say I ain't hate 'em)
(I feel you though Dollar Sign)
[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I hate a groupie ho with a passion
Saying "that's the homie" but he smashin'
I hate to see a broke bitch flashin'
Chanel bag that she never keep cash in
Hate when bitches try to put you in the friend zone
Bitch I'm tryna score put me in the end zone
Hate to see a thick bitch on Instagram
And the bitch show up looking like a Teddy graham (unfollow)
Flat butt, fat gut, thirst bucket, that's what
Type of shit that I hate, I let a thirsty ho dehydrate
Backward ass bitch, do a good nigga bad
'Sposed to keep you happy, they just make a nigga mad
Nosy ass hoes, I hate 'em
Always finding shit but can't find a man to date them, huh

[Hook 2: Ty Dolla Sign]
Type of shit that I hate
Yeah, type of shit that I hate
Woah, that's the type of shit that I hate
Woah, that's the type of bitch that I hate
Yeah, yeah

IT'S YG 4 HUNDRED !

[Verse 3: YG]
I hate a bitch that love a bitch that say she love a nigga too
Confuse ass bitch What you gon'do?
Is you gay bitch? Is you straight bitch?
Do this pussy smell good only cause it stank bitch?
Shit, that some shit I don't like
Fuck them and leave them now she tryna get you a low dick right bitch
Ooh you got me fuck ya
You was running from the dick, you ain't said that when I fuck
Since instagram, I've done seen too many pretty bitches
Since instagram, you've been taking too many pictures
Now that's some shit that I hate, if that pussy stank to the house, I migrate
She call a nigga up like " What's happening?"
"You don't want this pussy?" - Nope bitch, I'm straight
I couldn't look in her eyes straight
She said she fucks with fly niggas only, that bitch a skyscraper


[Hook 3: Ty Dolla Sign]
Type of shit that I hate
Yeah, type of shit that I hate
Woah, that's the type of shit that I hate
Woah, that's the type of bitch that I hate
Yeah, yeah

[Interlude: Ed Sheeran]
Darling, I can't wait till the morning
But I promise I won't rush on you
I can't wait till the morning
But I swear I'll take my time on you
I've got you screaming yeah yeah yeah yeah
I've got you screaming yeah yeah yeah yeah
I've got you screaming yeah
I've got you screaming yeah yeah yeah yeah



[Verse 1]
Strings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don't trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy

[Hook 1]
Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)

[Verse 2]
Everything's in a haze
Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
Everything's blurry
Oh, what's happened to me?

[Hook 2]
Say, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
Now, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)




[Refrain]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

[Vers 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Refrain]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Vers 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the ceili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Refrain]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Vers 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Refrain]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl




[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
She was walking in the street, looked up and noticed
He was nameless, he was homeless
She asked him his name and told him what hers was
He gave her a story 'bout life
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation, a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
She's riding in a taxi back to the kitchen
Talking to the driver 'bout his wife and his children
On the run from a country where they put you in prison
For being a woman and speaking your mind
She looked in his eyes in the mirror and he smiled
One conversation, a single moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
Everybody rise up
You gonna rise up, ayy

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come (Say you're gonna make it)
Young teachers, student doctors (Yeah)
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Oomba-oomba
Oomba-oomba-oomba
Oomba-oomba
Oomba-oomba-oomba

[Verse 1: Protoje]
And I said get on your feet and live
Nothing but strength and blessings I bring
And this one for all my queens and kings
We are royalty, yup, they know dem ting
I feel like the world really needs some change
This can't be right, whole ting feel so strange
Right now, all that we need is love
Some empathy, yes, the season's up

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
They said I'll never make it
The dreams I'm chasing
I'm all alone
I am destined for greatness
Time to embrace it
Breaking the mold

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Now they gonna see us
When you start out, they gon' give you love
But you find out what you're really worth
Then you go hard and you deal it rough
They gonna try and take it all away
Can't nobody take it all away
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Hurt, and you love
And you hurt and you've had enough


[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
They said I'll never make it
The dreams I'm chasing
I'm all alone
I am destined for greatness
Time to embrace it
Breaking the mold

[Bridge: Chronixx]
You see the gyal
Oomba-oomba
Oomba-oomba-oomba
Oomba-oomba
Oomba-oomba-oomba
Whoa

[Verse 3: Chronixx]
Yeah, shorty tell everybody who ever doubt me

Woi, and now the money get crowdy
They step inna mi shows, clearly they dem never know me
Sometimes, the dirt get so lonely (Yeah)
Give thanks for the love that surround me (Ooh)
The love that my family show me
Yeah, we a rise and it a bun dem (Yeah)
The Rastaman people, just a nun dem (Yeah)
More love to my daughter and my son dem
And our cup runneth over like a fountain, yeah
They said


[Chorus: Alicia Keys & (Chronixx)]
They said I'll never make it
The dreams I'm chasing
I'm all alone
(I am) I am destined for greatness (Woi)
Time to embrace it (Ooh, yeah)
Breaking the mold (No, no, no)

[Outro: Chronixx]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh



[Verse 1]
Made of clay, shoot me down
I'll ricochet to the ground
Words of paint, draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know it's over before it's begun
I lost my way, so help me out
And lend your hand 'til I am found
My voice is mute, not to be heard
So it's up to you for you to bring those words

[Hook]
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time

[Verse 2]
This grief you give, it takes its toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree, whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones, oh

[Hook x2]
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time


[Verse 1]
I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

[Chorus]
That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied


[Verse 2]
Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another "like you"
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything's great, not everything's sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

[Chorus]
Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied


[Verse 3]
Because, if I was gonna go somewhere
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (wo-oahh)
And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Main vein pointing up to the sky
Spread legs when I'm between her thighs
But I've seen her on Jezza Kyle
So I'll take her up da bum den

HOE

I know birds that Cillit wouldn'tBang
20 years young but they're lookin like me Gran
Wanna bit of bucket?
You can fuck um for a gram
But they're usually equipped with a pram
Where I'm from they're fit
If ya carefully pick
But ya gotta watch cos they're skanks
I'm not into the glitz and the glam
Mandem I just want the tits and the clam

I don't do online beef
Cos that's behind me
But I'll ride ya wife whilst ya film and time me
And cry when ya see I'm 9"
But I'm only 5" deep
Inside ya bride whilst I ride her nicely

I'm super fine
With an Uber 9"
Ya look like you haven't had a poo for time
This is abuse
I can even use a stupid rhyme
This Wrexham boy leavin you crucified

IM GONE
(Don't forget about me, Don't forget about me!)
...Well I'm gonna stay here to supervise

It's my time
Wanna show people that I do Grime
I need to dye my ginge
Finally touch a minge
And try and write my own rhymes
I know half of my hits are quite shite
Half of the time I admit I'm on spice
Ever since back in the days
Harassin for change
Havin a strum outside a FiveGuys

Yes I

I am dreadful
And if you buy my tracks then you're mental
I don't write shit
But I get paid for it
And if you're looking for ink
I got a pen full
Ya like 'Burberry get off ya high horse'
And let the prick pluck his plectrum
Ya can travel all ya want ya whiny ginger cunt
But you'll never be a Burbz from Wrexham

HA

Main vein pointin up to the sky
Spread legs when I'm between her thighs
But I've seen her on Jezza Kyle
So I'll take her up da bum den

UH

If her dial isn't nice and it's gross
Got downs or fucks thousands of blokes
Note down this advice bout this hoe
Take her up da bum den

When I squeeze this massive big dick of mine
I can pick to fuck any kinda chick I like
(And I'll only go for a 10 or a 9)
(They never cum)
(But I always arrive ahead of time)
I've had Albanians
And Australians
Think I've even fucked a cross-dressed Alien
Given my pidyn to South Waleians
(And the blondes never seem to be the brainy ones)
But I got goals
And they got holes
Just give um fags then come off their clothes
Record some clips of their tits to ya phone
And Ed said
(Aww send some please I've got none)
That's not the way things go
Plus me battery's low
Are ya dyin for a slap?
Man, get yer own
Got globally known
And I did it alone
And I never fitted in
But I fitted in me bone

2019 you're still rippin it up
I thought Burberry woulda given it up
You make people by tear not givin a fuck
And become the pioneer of ploughin through muff

You get all the tits
(Yeah and its top)
And you get the assholes
(Yeah, on Xbox)
But when you're miles away
And you're dreamin of his bone
Please remember you can also text my phone

Main vein pointin up to the sky
(Yeah please)
(He gets plenty as it is)
Spread legs when I'm between her thighs
(My number is 0752-)
But I've seen her on Jezza Kyle
So I'll take her up da bum den

If her dial isn't nice and it's gross
Got downs or fucks thousands of blokes
Note down this advice bout this hoe
Take her up da bum den

Take her up
Take her up
Take her
Up da bum den

Take her up
Don't wake her up
Just take her up
Da bum den

[Verse 1]
Wedding night and I'm taking you home
It's too late to be safe alone
19 cigarettes but I'll share the last one with you
We broke into your dad's house [?] in
And we kissed on his old leather couch
Til it was time to go home again
We've been drinkin' far too long
We always seem to do that
But I don't want this to go wrong

[Chorus]
So tell me if you're fallin'
Cause darling I have almost reached that point
We all know the things we've taken
But it's not the chemicals
Ls that make me want you
It's the way you kiss me
Not those shots of whiskey
You know I'm far from tipsy
So let's not fuck this up again
We are, we are in love
We are, we are us

[Verse 2]
So that night I'm looking for [?]
It seems to me there's still [?]
Apologize, I can [?] anyway
We are two separate bodies, oh listen
And with my arms around you, shadows turn into [?]
[?]
I am so hungover
I'm glad I'm not alone

[Chorus]
So tell me if you're fallin'
Cause darling I have almost reached that point
We all know the things we've taken
But it's not the chemicals that makes me want you
It's the way you kiss me
Not those shots of whiskey
You know I'm far from tipsy
So let's not fuck this up again
We are, we are in love
We are, we are us
We are, we are in love
And we are, we are us

[Bridge]
On a weekend hideaway
I found my best friend
[?]
That we can do this again, I might have [?]
Cause if I spoke to my Lord
He'd probably say that all that I needed was you

[Chorus]
So tell me if you're fallin'
Cause darling I have almost reached that point
We all know the things we've taken
But it's not the chemicals that makes me want you
It's the way you kiss me
Not those shots of whiskey
You know I'm far from tipsy
So let's not fuck this up again
We are, we are in love
We are, we are us


[Chorus 1]
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

[Chorus 2]
Since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

[Verse]
Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you find the right man who'll fix it for you
And are you shopping anywhere
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?


[Chorus 2]
Since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

[Chorus 1]
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

[Chorus 2]
Since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

[Verse 1]
I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

[Hook]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

[Verse 2]
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets


[Hook]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

[Verse 3]
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up



[Intro]
On the last few days of LA, I got taken into this guy's house and he was sponsored by an alcohol company---quite a few actually---and uh-- got pretty wasted, umm-- all times and I was sitting underneath a tree with my phone just putting in lyrics, "Bah! This is how I feel. Bah!" And uh... I came up with this song and it is called "Wake Me Up"
Because I was really pissed, it is quite silly. Bear that in mind

[Verse 1]
I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles

Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

[Chorus]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

[Verse 2]
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Because we've watched it 12 times
And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say

I know I've always been shit at computer games
Because your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets

[Chorus]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

[Verse 3]
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try to get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

[Interlude: (Gyptian - "Hold Yuh")]
Girl me wann fi hold yuh
Put me arms right around ya
Girl you give me the tightest love me eva get inna my life
Girl me just wann fi  squeeze yah
Put me arms right around ya
Girl you give me the tightest love me eva get inna my life
Oh in my life, oh
Oh in my life, oh
Oh in my life, ooh oh

[Outro]
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up




[Verse 1]
I am a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And there's no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright land to which I go

[Hook]
And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now

[Interlude]
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah (Mmmm)
Hey ay ay yeah (Oooh)
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah

[Verse 2]
And I know dark clouds, will gather me
And I know my way is rough and steep
And the beautiful fields that lie just beyond me
And I know my needs are rough and steep

[Hook]
And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now

[Verse 1]
'Cause I am a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And there's no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright land to which I go

[Hook]
And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now




[Hook]
Well I once heard a story about a run-down home
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He's slowly finding a way back home

[Verse]
He had a nice family with smiles and frowns
They never could solve his way to be down
Cos he's one dog who don't want a bone
He's slowly finding a way back home

He had a nice house with windows and doors
He said to his wife what's mine is yours
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown
He's slowly finding a way back home

His children have left but the rooms are still there
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair
But far from the nest the babies have flown
He's slowly finding a way back home

His wife was an angel sent from above
He never returned her kisses or love
But soon he'd found that she'd overgrown
This man who's finding a way back home

So the leaves are all dead in this broken man's June
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon
He stares at the floor, no more to roam
He's slowly finding a way back home

[Hook]


[Verse 1]
Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinkin' 'bout her

[Refrain]
And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

[Chorus]
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my


[Post-Chorus]
Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my-

[Verse 2]
First love never dies
Guess I'll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There's just one thing I remember

[Refrain]
Her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

[Chorus]
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my


[Post-Chorus]
Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my-

[Outro]
That's the-
That's the-
That's the-
Did I, did I?
That's the-
That's the-
That's the way to break my-

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

Leaves have fallen to the ground
And now there's no one else around
To hear the cry

Oh oh

I saw your body
I saw your face
Loss of presence
Loss of grace
Behind those eyes

Oh oh

And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone


Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

I miss your laughter
I miss your tears
I miss your rambling
About your fears
Your smile
The crowd has gathered
All around
No ones speaking
No one makes a sound
And I...

And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone

We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
Alone


Alone now...

[x5]
They're never gonna change you
They're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change us
We'll always stay the same

We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone



Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heart beat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go


We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


[Verse 1: Corbyn Besson, with Daniel Seavey]
I met her on a Monday evening
She was standing outside of the park and ride
And I said, "Hey ma, where you been?"
"Been looking for a woman like you for all my life"
And she said, "Hola, talk to me, before I have to leave"
And one day we could be
Maybe more than two lost souls just passing by

[Pre-Chorus: Jonah Marais]
Knew I was falling when I looked inside your eyes
She said, "I know you are, but what am I?"

[Chorus: Daniel Seavey & Corbyn Besson]
Tell me, have you seen a sunset
Turn into a sunrise?
Kiss right through the night?
'Cause we should try that sometime
Hold you 'til the mornin'
And if I said I'm fallin', would you just reply
"I know you are, but what am I?"

Open the door to my apartment, when we get in
Kissin' on my neck and throw my jacket to the side
And I know your heart is beating quick
And if you put your head on my chest, hear the same in mine, yeah
And we'll be making love
Until the sun comes up
But one day maybe I
I could put a ring on your finger before you change your mind, yeah

Knew I was falling when I looked inside your eyes
She said, "I know you are, but what am I?"

[Verse 1]
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels"

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Verse 2]
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios

[Verse 1]
Winter days, turn to grey, put the headlights on
Snow and rain, wiped away, I can't keep my eyes on the road
When I'm driving home
I got tears, running down, burning in my eyes and
You and I, heated by the flicker of a lighter glow
And I let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
But I just got here
I know it's been a while darling, dear
There's been a change in the time of year
When the frost bites the snow
And Christmas comes around

[Chorus]
For the down-and-outs
And broken lay-abouts
What will they do now?
When Christmas comes around
We were so in love
Till I messed it up
But who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around

[Verse 2]
Family asking me, why I let you go
Telling me, its a mistake
I'm telling them that I know
But I can't call you
You're in a space, better place
Loving on a new man
I don't blame you at all
You did all that you can, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
But I just got here
I know it's been a while darling, dear
There's been a change in the time of year
When the frost bites the snow
And Christmas comes around

[Chorus]
For the down and outs
And broken lay-abouts
What will they do now?
When Christmas comes around
We were so in love
Till I messed it up
But who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around

[Bridge]
And I'm sick of all the songs
The Christmas sing-alongs
The merry and the cheer
'Cause I don't feel like that this year
All the bells are out of sync
And my soul is on the brink
So I'll have myself a drink, and sing
When Christmas comes around

[Chorus + Outro]
For the down-and-outs
And broken lay-abouts
What will they do now?
When Christmas comes around
We were so in love
Till I messed it up
But who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around

Who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around




[Verse 1: Niall & All]
Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
It took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

[Chorus: Zayn]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?

[Verse 2: Liam & Harry & All]
Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from
Love was something you never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

[Chorus: Zayn & Harry & All]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping baby by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?

[Bridge: Harry & All]
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid
(Where do broken hearts go?)
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me, will you ever love me again, love me again?

[Chorus: Zayn & All & Louis & (Harry)]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping baby by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Tell me where you're hiding out
Where do broken hearts go?
(Come on baby, 'cause I need you now)
Where do broken hearts go? Tell me 'cause I'm 10 feet down
Where do broken hearts go? Come on baby, come and get me out
Come on baby, come and get me out
(Come on baby, 'cause I need you now)
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?




[Instrumental]


[Verse 1]
Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I'm next to you

[Chorus]
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can't make up my mind
So let's free fall and see where we land

[Verse 2]
It's been this way since we were young
We'll fight and then make up
I'll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch

[Chorus]
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can't make up my mind
So let's free fall and see where we land


[Bridge]
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da

[Chorus]
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can't make up my mind
So let's free fall and see where we land

I stare at my reflection in the mirror
Why am I doing this to myself?
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No

Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart

Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are

Brushing my hair
Do I look perfect?


I forgot what to do to fit the mold
The more I try
The less it's working
Yeah
When everything inside me screams
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah

Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

Fake shows, egos
Fake shows like woah
And leave me alone
Real talk, real life
Good love, goodnight
With a smile
Thats my home
Thats my home
Thats my home


Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are...
Mmm...

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning and I'm waiting for a train
Darling, I'll be gone for a while
Don't know how to ask but, baby, will you wait?
You know the world gets lonely sometimes
A rolling stone in the desert, a wind that blows in the trees
Through the storms and bad weather, babe
The only thing that we need

[Chorus:]
Is a love, burning love, well, it's a wildfire love
Taking everything it sees
And it's a love, red-hot love, well, it's a wildfire love
Well, baby, that's just you and me
Oh, baby, that's just you and me

[Verse 2]
There were times when I was far away from you
And I saw your face in the stars
On the road again and counting down the days
Wishing you were here in my arms
A boat that flows on the river
A bird that soars on the sea
Through the storms and bad weather, babe
The only thing that we need


[Chorus]
Is love, burning love, well, it's a wildfire love
Taking everything it sees, yeah
It's a love, red-hot love, well, it's a wildfire love
Baby, that's just you and me, oh

[Bridge]
We were never just a waste of time
Maybe you should see the way we shine
See the lights from a thousand miles away, yeah
Girl, without you I would lose my mind
You're living proof that love is blind
All I want in the world is you and me

[Chorus]
Yeah, and our love, burning love, our wildfire love
Taking everything we see, yeah
Our love, red-hot love, well, it's a wildfire love
Maybe that's just you and me
Oh, that's just you and me
Oh, that's just you and me

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here



[Verse 1: Jesy Nelson and Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
I always say what I'm feeling
I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out
I like my coffee with two sugars in it
High heels and my jewellery dripping
Drink and I get all fired up (Hey, hey, hey)
Insecure but I'm working with it
Many things that I could get rid of
Ain't about to give it up

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards and Jess Glynne]
I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My mama always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
(A woman)

[Chorus: Jade Thirlwall and Jess Glynne]
Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (A woman)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me

[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
And baby, just be mine for the weekend
We can get a takeaway and sit on the couch
Or we could just go out for the evening
Hopefully end up with you kissing my mouth, ayy, ayy
You got them blue jeans with a rip up in them
My hair with your fingers in it
Love it when you turn me on
'Yonce with a little bit of
"Love Drunk" in the middle with it
Get down to our favorite song

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards and Jess Glynne]
I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, woman like me, yes a woman like me (oh)

You know all them mandem, a try to swipe me (kyuh)
Knotted up, he could afford to ice me (Hh, rhrr)
Tell 'em there's a bad Trini bitch inna your area (uh)
But the more bad bitches, then the more merrier (c'mon)
Baddies to my left and to the right a little scarier (uh)
Rude boy, tell me, can you handle all this derriere? (da derriere, rhrr)
Uh, a million I'm getting my billy on
Greatest of all time, 'cause I'm a chameleon
I switch it up for every era, I'm really bomb
These bitches really wanna be Nicki, I'm really mom (uh)
Apple cut the cheque, I want all this money
Seven Up, go grip the TEC, and leave all this bloody
I-It's the Queen and Little Mix, skated on 'em, sorry
My daddy is Indian (Swish), a-all this curry (Mhm)

And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
(Fall for a woman like me)


[Chorus: Jade Thirlwall]
Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
(Could you fall for a woman like me)

[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson & Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
And baby, just be mine for the weekend
We can get a takeaway and sit on the couch
Or we could just go out for the evening
Hopefully end up with you kissing my mouth, ayy, ayy
You got them blue jeans with a rip up in them
My hair with your fingers in it
Love it when you turn me on
'Yonce with a little bit of
"Love Drunk" in the middle with it
Get down to our favorite song

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall & Perrie Edwards]
I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
(Fall for a woman like me)


[Chorus: Jade Thirlwall]
Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me
(Could you fall for a woman like me)



Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna give it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...

I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never bring it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...

I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
You're could have be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...


I'm what's good in your thoughts
And the bad girl that you want caught



Old yeller!!!




[Verse 1]
I felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I can't forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See, I was wrong on how I hate you
And it's the worst thing that I did

[Hook]
When I read through you
You weren't translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I'd be free from it

[Verse 2]
See, all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on I'm back in my mood
See, I got drunk and said I loved you
And it's the worst thing that I did

[Hook]




[Verse 1: Wiley]
The thoughts I have could be clear ones, they can seem vivid
The goals I reach are not near ones, the further the limit
I block her out so when I'm looking though my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum
It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots
What's better than thinking about the ones you love?
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up
No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you

[Verse 2: Wiley]
I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
Cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind
Now I've been thinking about this, you told me say "Yes Nan"
I'm 31 now, I'm still saying "Yes Nan"
You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one
I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like
Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like
And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm gone I want my music to play
And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about the scene I made
I say the game's better, it's a must now I've gotta fly
My talents gonna shine real shortly, fam i know it
I work round the clock I don't stop at night

[Hook x2]


[Verse 1]
Well my friend it seems we've come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you

[Hook 1]
'Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

[Verse 2]
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you're too cold
And she said 'I can put away all those lies
And show you there's no surprise in me'

[Hook 2]
Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left


[Verse 3]
Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that's what's going on

[Hook 1]

[Outro]
You break me



[Verse 1]
Well my friend it seems we've come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you

[Hook 1]
'Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

[Verse 2]
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out

And show you there's no surprise in me'

[Hook 2]
Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

I believe you will relieve me

[Outro]
You break me


[Intro: Yelawolf]
For fuck's sake, yeah
Yelawolf, Melody Man

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Living the life of a student, yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind and they say that I've been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight and never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad with a ten in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
'Cause I've hidden my pride, giving the time
To write rhymes but I find truth at a quarter to five
Hey!

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
It's kinda like I took a train to the left side of my brain, oh, mayne
Puddles of mud, under my love, you know I'm stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology, psychologically insane
Pardon me while I get down, down, down
Making you get up and say...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
If you don't know
If you don't know by now, you better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him 'bout? Yeah
Yeah


[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Ten toes to the dirt, pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink, drink a pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels, I'm a ridah, steel ring, no Prada
Only thrift clothes and my ada-di-das
I'm a fetus in my room, say na na
Daddy's home, on the mic, hey papa

[Verse 4: Ed Sheeran]
Back with a bang yo, straight loop pedal, no band though
But every single one of my fans know
That every damn show I'm taking their ears on a journey
Like I'm flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin' so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics 'cause they think I've been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes, rocking a Kangol
I'm riding 'round with Yelawolf in your daddy's Lambo

[Verse 5: Yelawolf]
Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You're probably sipping sweet tea still, huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
That what you used to steal from
You been playing fools like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game when you know the meal's done
Yelawolf is gettin' back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still, son, woah
This old rock, the hill's been rolled
Still shocking when I see 'em go
Bananas, when they handle this animalistic flow


[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
If you don't know
If you don't know by now, you better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him 'bout? Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 6: Yelawolf]
I'm not the average half-a-wit after this hour gets out of this
60 seconds, I'm goin' any direction and
Chasing this Jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
Is probably the better idea, yeah, you move when the direction in
Fact, it's a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blow on this fucking mic like a wind 'til college start again
Hooligans, hooligans rule again but really who's a friend?
Jump in this lake of fire, jump right back in the pool again
Knew I'd be new again, a student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers, I'm tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4, minus war, you don't want it
Shady Records, I'm already better, fuck it, doggonnit
Dog don't gotta lead, dog's already home, Jack
Dogg I'm a beast, I'm a wolf, bring your dogs back (Woof !)
A melody-man and a melancholy mellow-yellow can
Shhhh, tell 'em how we gonna sell 'em man

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & Yelawolf]
Been working hard all week
So if you wonder if we earned it, well it's not a probably
So won't you bring that back to me
And holler when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween
I got blisters on my feet
To walk at night with you, is not the shoes to be borrowing
So won't you bring that back to me
'Cause all the soul of my pen is only what all the sorrow brings
If you don't know


[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
You don't know, if you don't know, if you don't know (no, no, no, no)
If you don't know, if you don't know, if you don't know (no, no, no)
If you don't know, if you don't know, if you don't know (no, no, no, no)
If you don't know, if you don't know, if you don't know (no, no)



Now I'm in town, break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer
You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
"A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi"

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me

Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can read the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow

From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic

Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide 'til we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the Myspace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you




[Intro]
I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound

My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning out
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning on a spliff of your high-grade
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning burning burning

[Verse 4]
Now, where I come burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high-grade weed you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I say where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yeah do da burn up the place up in the hood
One of the things that I've inherited
Like a ghetto man you should
One of the things is smoking weed
Yes it makes me feel good
But high-grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
Mommy, yes I'm gonna table sensimilla is a drug
And If I start to smoke I'm gonna turn into a thug
Where I come from all that talking
It could only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed
It is a blessing from above
Where I come from, yes we burn it
When we listen rob a dove
Where I come from, yes we burn it
After we dash to make love
Where I come from, yes we burn it
When the sun does shine
I blaze high-grade weed all the time

[Chorus]
Now, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Eyes are red
Ooohh
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red

Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Yeah

[Verse 5]
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights
At stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, Now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height, and I'm going hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter
Yeah, the game's over, but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track, without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch
So, you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow
From day one I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa
Giving a dose of what the future holds-
Cos it's another day close, close, close, close brrrrr
I've still got a rucksack for the old clothes
I rap with the cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes
In fact, you don't know
On tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
Man, flows developing
Skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team
I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women
And then I packaged the image
Put in some content
And then I throw it back as a gimmick
The fact is this
I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses
I think I need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders
I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard part's sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping back to back
Cause I've been practising
I'm back to sing this, yes

[Chorus]
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man

[Verse 6]
I'll keep my last name forever
Keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tune
When I chase it
And replace it with an elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes, using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack
Aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack
Aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack
Still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But, more people hear me, though
According to the Myspace and Youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, If I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming
Like I'm fucking in an elevator

[Chorus]
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show
Every night in front of a new crowd
That's new now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you (at all)
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you (at all)
You need me

[Verse 2]
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer you're just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, (at all)
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, (at all)
You need me


[Verse 3]
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and... all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy...
My head in the sky... Ready to die
Ed Sheeran, Alone Star
Coming out here freestyling with the guitar
Cause I've forgotten the lyrics of this bit right here
So I freestyle off the top of the bit with the...

[Interlude: "In Da Club"]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough


[Break]
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning

[Verse 4]
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cos if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cos like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!
Now my eyes are red

[Chorus]
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you

[Spoken]
Okay so this is the breakdown bit where we get a little bit funky. Ugh, and I forget about the whole week, you forget about the whole week, the whole weekend. Just forget about everything! 'Cause it's Sunday and we're all gonna get drunk after this and have a very, very good time and I'm not stressed anymore. We're just letting it unwind. I wanna split the room in the middle here. Who's up for that? Not, not, not literally. You don't have to literally divide. It's all good, all good. Peace and love, peace and love and harmony. What was I gonna say? This side, up there, are you with me? This side, up there, are you with me? Everyone scream as loud as you can! (screaming) Okay, so we found out that everyone's voices work. This side, I'm not gonna insult you but you are West Ham, okay? You're West Ham, yeah? You're West Ham Football Club. Get in the geezer mode, yeah? This side, you're Millwall, yeah? You two, you two hate each other. You two are gonna beat each other at whatever you do, no matter what. So if I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. If I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. Are you all up for that? Millwall, are you ready? (yeah!) West Ham, are you ready? (yeah!) Okay, West Ham, you sing this...

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

Millwall, you sing this:
My eyes are red!
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red!
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, (my eyes are red!)
(You need me, man, I don't need you)
(You need me, man, my eyes are red!)
You need me, man, I don't need you
Millwall are winning I think

[Verse 5]
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

[Interlude]
I got my friend, very good friend Random Impulse. He's gonna come up and he's gonna spit a few bars on the beat. Everyone give it up for Random Impulse!

[Verse 6: Random Impulse]
Yo!
In this game, I am my own damn man, no restriction, post or boundaries
Spouting heat, hungry and my circle always round to eat
Crossing circles, counting thousands at a thousand feet
Counting sheep and he's sound asleep
Summoned from the deep, now I float, to sink my boat, you'll need a thousand fleets
Walk on any beat and stomp it like a thousand feet
Talk is cheap, so I could treat you to my words for free
Now that I'm out, man, I ain't playing like I hurt my knee
It's common courtesy, I left you for a minute
Now I'm back and packing punches like I'm Popeye popping spinach
Eating every course... lunch, I ain't forgotten dinners
Play guitars as well as bars so you ain't rocking with beginners
Sorry, time's ticking, I can't mess with up-and-comers
National lottery business, only winners have my numbers
Man I'm nothing like you fronters, show you how it is
I can't really do nothing for you 'less you got something to give, Ed!

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me

[Verse 7]
I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
Later!
Thank you... thank you so much! See you soon!

[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now

You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

[Verse 2]
I sing, "I write my own tune and I write my own verse," hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last, if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre

Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady

[Pre-Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly

Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it

[Chorus 2]
Now my eyes are red
'Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
At stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day
Plus
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

[Breakdown]
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

[Breakdown]
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you


[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

[Breakdown]
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

[Breakdown]
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flow's developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women and then I packaged the image
Put in some content and I then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rappping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
X2
You need me


[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
I said you need 3 man I don't need 2
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my own gear like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I've found out being odd ain't even
I qualified for everything, long straight season
It's not a dilemma king, got a straight queening
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in
MC with the mic is MC dinner time
Now I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light
I didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a Sisqo plaque
This is what happens when your gift is talent
And all you imagined exists, imagine
I never drop shit and I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my hand, I'mma smash it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Devlin]
You need me, but I dont need you
D-E-V-L-I-N Ed and 32
Lyrically more capable to break 'em all
I won't have to amputate a lower limb to make them fall
Like autumn, check my post mortem
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for this fortune
I don't mean money, I mean luck
But now the clock's aviated
Everybody's time's up
Nothing's what I had and everything's what I gave
Like a sprinter near the finish line fighting for his place
Keep your diamonds and your chains
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe
Cause I get respected
While they get detested
Tell the truth there ain't nobody that done what Devs did
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9
You ain't competition just a fish you're tryna bite a line


[Hook]

[Verse 1: Dot Rotten & Scrufizzer]
Right now it's the millitant spot with Fizzer and Dot
We've got a villainous plot to make billions watch
Bringing the hot flows skipping across
Delivering some of the illest bars, killing them off
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah we're doing the damn thing
Man think we need them but onna that thing
Nah I'm back in this raptures, double my ad-libs
Got them all banging the anthems having a madness
For me the music's the thorn in my vein
Calling my name, yeah, we're lord of the raves
I swear down I got them all talking my name
Been working all year it's the ultimate gain
Uh, look I don't need you making us angry, we were so peaceful
You don't really wanna see us get so lethal, any foe to approach
Will be ghosted and don't be fooled, yes, people

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

[Verse 2: Dot Rotten & Scrufizzer]
Yeah, yeah y'all messed up everybody's hyped
Even a blind man can see the devil in my eyes
Many were the times that he saw me stepping on the mic
Setting it alight, come up with the energy and vibe
Feel like I'm back from a coma, stronger than ever
Songs are forever so I'm living longer than ever
Any genre, whatever, I'll be setting off a bomb
Cause my longevity's just too long for a measure
Well I'm setting off better, I'm taking over faster
Showering down, you better put your umbrella on
Yeah I'm stepping up a level, got my foot on the pedal
I'm coming to be the better vision than [?] when I'm spitting
They had to resist because they need a stage to perform
Case and a cord, you won't see me pace through the door
Thinking I'm gonna be rich so I'm chasing the Forbes
Spreading like a plague, songs getting played when I [?]

[Chorus (Extended): Ed Sheeran]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

[Verse 3: Dot Rotten & Scrufizzer]
Yo, living out our days in [?]
As if I went crazy in a whip crashing the ride
Double "P" when we enter that's passion and pride
They ain't gotta life cause they let that battery die
I'm a shooting star that ain't catching your eye
An assassin with lines and immaculate rhymes
They all say they're the truth but it's actually lies
So we hit them with a punch like a Cassidy line
Yeah I tried to relax but you can feel the anger inside
Raging like I stand on the right, yeah my stamina is high
Yeah I'm living like I stand with the Mayans
So think twice cause our plans are defiant
It's blatant you need me, who's this face on the TV?
Come on, we're taking it easy
Got kids in the school exchanging the CD
Love hearing the bars, impatient to cheer me

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me](3455538)

[[Chorus (Extended): Ed Sheeran]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me


[Verse 1]
Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I'm a bad influence, that'll do
'Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just don't talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don't be slow
This'll only take a mo'
Take yourself right out of my door

[Hook]
It's just that they don't care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don't reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don't give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl's trouble


[Verse 2]
Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
'Cos you're a bad influence, that'll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just don't talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don't be slow
This'll only take a mo'
Take yourself right out of my door

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever, either
Dance as you're a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you don't see
Fell the weight, gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2D
The only thing that's free in life is love
And that don't come cheap

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
They call me young gun like I was a pistol in the primary
Speaking codes no binary
Irony, is that I don't have a beautiful mind at all
I'm not tired at all
There's no time to pause
Deep thought, with my feet sore from walking
Not a lot of money for a cheap Porsche
Though I don't drive but I'm known by the guys
That are designed to make you go hype
Like Devlin & Grim with the chilling, chilling
Bring Yasmin for the singing, killing
And I'm keeping the melody where it better be
I'm deadly and readily burning within the evergreen of enemies
Higher than a feather with Amphetamines
Only my head top could be ahead of me
Voice hoarse but guess what? It's never Ketamine
Making noise from Brent Cross
Head in the hedge tops
Giving up my soul again for the guest spot
Four young guns in London
When we're coming up

[Chorus: Yasmin]
And the feeling of thunder
Storming from my hunger
And I'm travelling higher
Should we wake up the fire?
That's why they call me a young gun
And now my name is getting bigger
Press the music like a trigger
Every young gun
And now my field just looking brighter
Never stops cause I'ma fight
Every young gun

[Verse 2: Griminal]
Yeah, me and Devlin young gunning
Skunk bunning, delete you with one button
If you don't know somebody best tell them
I turn everything here red, Ed Sheeran
I already went heaven, let's get them
I'll better them in 10 seconds
Since I got a holla back like Gwen Steffans
Follow that because I'm trend setting
(?) you get better instead of gettin' the message
I put in less of the effort
I'm still better than most
Come around try bread, all you'll be getting is toast
I've been ten out of ten from eleven years old
Try run from me but I left him alone
I'm back for the title like I'm living at home
See me at the O2, no gassing
Know that I'm coming up next like Yasmin

[Chorus: Yasmin]
And the feeling of thunder
Storming from my hunger
And I'm travelling higher
Should we wake up the fire?
That's why they call me a young gun
And now my name is getting bigger
Press the music like a trigger
Every young gun
And now my field just looking brighter
Never stops cause I'ma fight
Every young gun

[Verse 3: Devlin]
Young guns
I'm a young gun like a brand new weapon
I'm outstanding, he's standard and tell them what I reckon
To be a part of the arsenal present
You'd have to be better than Devlin, Yasmin, Griminal and Edders
So in that case forget it
If you don't make the cut like a radio edit
You'll get left beheaded then deaded
When Devs takes you out like a direct debit
One, I runaway for a minute of two
But now I'm back in the booth
I got 'em all pissed like I poured Cognac on the tune
I ain't nobody's sun cause I stand on the moon
Young guns full of class A lines that'll heighten your mood (?)
Like chasin' spirals with a spoon
You're not safe like a baby inside of the womb
Every time we arrive in the room

[Chorus: Yasmin]
And the feeling of thunder
Storming from my hunger
And I'm travelling higher
Should we wake up the fire?
That's why they call me a young gun
And now my name is getting bigger
Press the music like a trigger
Every young gun
And now my field just looking brighter
Never stops cause I'ma fight
Every young gun

[Verse 1]
I woke up with a fear this morning
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say, "Love, baby, let's go back to my flat"
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Post-Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Verse 2]
No fear but I think I'm falling, I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run (Oh)
No risk so I think I'm all-in
When I kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say, "Love, this is what it's all about"
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Post-Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love-ove
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Bridge]
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
I don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
I only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm (Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
I don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm (Got me feeling like)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love-ove
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Verse 1]
I woke up with a fear this morning
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alone without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say "love, baby, let's go back to my flat"
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that

[Chorus]
I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
Only want to sing your song
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, you know
Your song's got me feeling like I'm
Yeah, you know
Your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Verse 2]
No fear but I think I'm falling
I'm not proud

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, you know
Your song's got me feeling like I'm
Yeah, you know
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Outro]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like I'm
