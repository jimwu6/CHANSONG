Now we're adversaries in a pretty house, yeah
Couldn't tell you what we're even fight 'bout, yeah
That's probably something we should figure out, yeah
Ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

[Verse 2]
Infatuation fading in and out, yeah
Gotta find a piece that keeps us sticking 'round, yeah
I should say I don't have a shred of doubt, yeah
We're alright, 'cause

[Chorus]
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

[Bridge]
There will be dark days, ooh
Swear that they'll be short
There will be good days, ooh
There'll be so many more
You can always be sure that

[Chorus]
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan]
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX, Troye Sivan & Both]
Back to where we came from
Playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view
I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999


[Bridge: Troye Sivan & Charli XCX]
Back to 1999
I know those days are over but a boy can fantasize
'Bout JTT on MTV and when I close my e-e-eyes
And I'm right there, right there
And he's right there, right there
And we're right there, right there
Ah, ah, ah, I wanna go back

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan, Charli XCX]
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me, you don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future, future, ah
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush

Don't make decisions for me, you don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future

[Verse: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan]
Woo, kill it, I'm so deadly, deadly
Ooh, I'm zooming like a jet ski, zoom zoom
Little dose of napalm, blow it up, yeah
Don't care what she talk about, nah
All she wanna do is my style, yeah
No one on my level
I play nice 'cause I'm too clever
I won't show it, never, never, but it's crystal (Woo)
I'm way up, way better
She might pop, but it's whatever
She might sell, but what's she selling?
Does she last long?
I know they write about me (Yeah)
I know that they all see me (Yeah)
Too scared so they don't play me
Some people tried to save me


[Bridge: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan, Charli XCX]
Ooh, but I'm feeling so good
Better than I ever could
Had bad people in my business, gone now
Cage, prison, now it's gone away
They wanna listen what I say
Think I care about the fame?
Na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan]
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us

Don't make decisions for me, you don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future, future, ah

[Verse 1]
I told you something safe
Something I've never said before
And I, I, I can't keep my hands off you
While you're lying awake
Covered all in the night before
I'm high, high, high, no one's got me quite like you

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

[Verse 2]
An ode to the boy I love
Boy, I'll die to care for you
You're mine, mine, mine, tell me who do I owe that to?
And as the days fly by
We'll be more than getting through, yeah
And in time, time, time, we'll build a home for two

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you


[Bridge]
All is right in the meadow
When I'm lying next to my fellow
Baby, that's you
Baby, that's
Baby, that's you, you-you
One way trip like an arrow
All laid out like a tarot
Baby, that's you
Baby, that's
Baby, that's you, you-you

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you
I am an animal with you



[Verse 1]
Stay awake, don't fall asleep on me
Watch our smoke in the sky
Close flying by, I
For heaven's sake, just enjoy the breeze
Hear the traffic go by
Sounds of the night, I

[Pre-Chorus]
And babe, the sex is free, these hotel sheets
And the world will freeze, but you and me go
On and on and on
We'll breathe the air selfishly
And feel that sense of urgency go
On and on and on

[Chorus]
I don't want another lover but you
I don't want another lover but you
And even if somebody said that I could choose
I don't want another lover but you, you

[Verse 2]
Take a sip, feel it burn your chest
Warm you inside out
Taste on your mouth when I bite your lip
Now run with it
Let's just see what's next
I don't want to go out
Let's fuck around, I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Babe, the sex is free, these hotel sheets
And the world will freeze, but you and me go
On and on and on

[Chorus]
I don't want another lover but you
I don't want another lover but you
And even if somebody said that I could choose
I don't want another lover but you, you

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want another lover but you
(I don't want, I don't want no, no)
I don't want another lover but you
(I don't want, I don't want no, no)
And even if somebody said that I could choose (If I could choose)
I don't want another lover but you, you

[Outro]
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
Just you


[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything


[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I just keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (love of my life, love of my life)

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[Verse 1]
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you wanna see a man up close?
A phoenix in the fire

[Chorus]
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don't bite

[Verse 2]
You can coax the cold right out of me
Drape me in your warmth
The rapture in the dark puts me at ease
The blind eye of the storm
Let's go for a walk down Easy Street
Where you can be reborn

[Chorus]
And kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don't bite

[Bridge]
Aah, I'm pulling on your heart to push my luck
Aah, 'cause who's got any time for growing up?
Kiss me on the mouth, free
Kiss me on the mouth, free
Kiss me, kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free


[Verse 1]
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you wanna see a man up close?
A phoenix in the fire
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don't bite

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Love hits hard, I know
All your lights are red, but I'm green to go
Used to see you high, now you're only low
All your lights are red but I'm green to go

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Alex Hope]
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

[Verse 2: Alex Hope]
I can't say no
Though the lights are on
There's nobody home
Swore I'd never lose control
Then I fell in love with a heart that beats so slow

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Alex Hope]
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you


[Bridge: Alex Hope]
I know you're seeing black and white
So I'll paint you a clear-blue sky
Without you I am colour-blind
It's raining every time I open my eyes
I know you're seeing black and white
So I'll paint you a clear-blue sky
Without you I am colour-blind
It's raining every time I open my eyes

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
When I'm looking up at you

[Verse 1]
In my free
In my wild
In my dark
Oh I started
Started to doubt
Doubt this fire
Lighting up our lives
And it kept me up at night

[Pre-Chorus]
Crash and burn
That's all I know
I think that's why I made you go
Those three words
You were my first
I can't help thinking

[Chorus]
Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue moon
My blue moon


[Verse 2]
Which one of us went and fucked up
You or me, guess it was me
Don't know a good thing when its right infront of me
'Cause I'm so numb, what have I become?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, cause' crash and burn
That's all I know
I think that's why I made you go
Those three words
You were my first
I can't help thinking

[Chorus]
Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue moon
My blue moon

[Pre-Chorus]
Crash and burn
That's all I know
I think that's why I made you go
Those three words
You were my first
I can't help thinking


[Chorus]
Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue

Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue moon

[Verse 1]
Sweet life living
Pools and swimming
Drinks in bars and
Boys in cars and
Rooftop sinning
Skinny dipping
Shooting stars with you
Fat cigars and

[Pre-Chorus]
And that weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and trying to be

[Chorus]
I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

[Verse 2]
Mansion debut
Love it, do you?
Absent father
Pays his daughter
And her mama withdrew
From the life they once knew
She had a heart
But she sold it off for

[Pre-Chorus]
And that weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and trying to be

[Chorus]
I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

[Post-Chorus]
When I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat, but nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't

[Chorus]
I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

[Post-Chorus]
When I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat, but nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't, yeah

[Chorus]
I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you

I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?




[Verse]
Now I'm knee-deep in this mess
I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read, I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am, with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out
I, I, I


[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Young ambition
Say we'll go slow, but we never do
Premonition
See me spendin' every night with you

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
And I wanna end up on you
Oh, don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just
Dance to this
Dance to this
We can just dance to this


[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Dear beloved
Bring those 501s a bit closer, bit closer
And dear, my lover
Do that thing we never do sober, sober

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan, Ariana Grande & Both]
Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
And I wanna end up on you (Yeah)
Oh, we don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Ariana Grande]
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just
Dance to this
Dance to this
We can just dance to this


[Bridge: Troye Sivan with Ariana Grande]
I don't wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
I just wanna take that ride
I don't wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
I just wanna take that ride

[Chorus: Troye Sivan with Ariana Grande]
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've
Already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just...
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just
Dance to this

[Outro: Troye Sivan, Ariana Grande & Both]
Dance to this, love
Dance to this
We can just, dance to this
Dance to this, dance to this

[Intro: Troye Sivan]
Wrapped my thoughts around your mind
Wrapped your body around mine

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Play it back and press rewind
To when you traced your fingers, drew my spine
Lost its beat and so I find
I starve my heart of touch and time

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
When we tried it, we were a fire with no smoke
Rags to riches but I'm addicted to being broken
You take my breath away, you know I'm bound to choke
When I close my eyes, I still see your ghost

[Chorus]
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around


[Bridge: Troye Sivan]
I don't keep love around, ye-eah
I don't keep love around, ooh yeah
I don't keep love around
Love around
Love around

[Verse 3: Tkay Maidza]
They can't stand, I handstand
Don't hold on right anymore
Pleased to meet you, I'm kinda moved
But that last one was my antidote
Green eyes, become green times
But there is no first or a last chance
They're telling me to turn down
'Cause I'm so lit, recall Flash Dance?
Only A1 and I stay 1
And I'm counting out for that day when
Residuals become imminent
Cause failure is not pivotal
They just be asking the same
Try switch it up, I switch lanes
No love in this world, I'm still sane
Right? Because that's enough?
When the light on and you don't keep love


[Outro: Troye Sivan]
"Distance makes the heart grow fonder'"
Said by someone stronger than me
So what do I do now? Do now?
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep, I don't keep
Love around



[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mummy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out c-calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Now I'm down to my skin and bones
My baby listens to me on the phone
But I can't help feeling like I'm all alone, all alone
The truth is, the stars are falling, babe
And I'd never ever thought that I would say
I'm afraid of the life that I've made, I've made

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Bridge: Georgia Nott]
I've been lyin' to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breathe
I've been out here for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
Always wrong

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Outro: Troye Sivan]
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Take me back to the basics and the simple life)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Your touch, my comfort and my lullaby)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night


I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mommy, she can't put down the phone

I've been lying to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breath
I've been hidin' for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
Always wrong

[Verse 1]
You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay
And he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love, and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me
It hasn't been easy, darlin'

[Chorus]
I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please, don't leave me, leave me (Easy)

[Verse 2]
What's left of the dance?
The smell on my hands
The rock in my throat, a hair on my coat
The stranger at home, my darling
(Like some kind of freak, my darling)
Now I'm vulnerable, so sad and alone
But don't cry for me, 'cause everyone knows
You reap what you sow, my darling
Yeah, yeah, yeah


[Chorus]
I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please, don't leave me, don't leave me

[Bridge]
He made it easy, please, don't leave me
He made it easy, please, don't leave me

[Chorus]
I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please, don't leave me, no, don't leave me

[Outro]
He made it easy
Please, don't leave me
He made it easy
Please, don't leave me

[Verse 1]
I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

[Pre-Chorus]
I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

[Chorus]
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Verse 2]
Oh, our lives don't collide, I'm aware of this
We've got differences and impulses, your obsession with
The little things you like stick, and I like aerosol
I don't give a fuck, I'm not giving up but I still want it all

[Chorus]
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall


[Pre-Chorus]
Now I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

[Chorus]
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Bridge]
Only fools fall for you, only fools (fall)
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools (fall)
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

(Only fools)

Only fools fall, only fools fall
Only fools

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack
You make up
We make a really good team
And though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us
Jump starting your car cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new cliches on our own little tour
Let's ride

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
We try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face, too easy
And we take jokes way too far
And sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you

[Verse 3: AllDay]
Eat a pill, stay and chill, you don't need to go
I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
I'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a TV show
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough
Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya
We canna get married tonight if you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break this lil' heart, it'd be an honour

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you

[Verse 1]
Well, don't you want to see the world, boy?
All the countries and their stars, boy
Just don't look them in the eyes, boy
You just gotta take their lives, boy
Let me take you for a drive, boy
Oh, I swear you'll feel alive, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

[Chorus]
Let's go have fun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun

[Post-Chorus]
Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun

[Verse 2]
When you're standing on the line, boy
Don't go looking for goodbye, boy
Yeah, you gotta set them free, boy
'Cause you know that's what they need, boy
Yeah, you're gonna make them proud, boy
Till they put you in the ground, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

[Chorus]
Let's go have fun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun

[Post-Chorus]
Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun, let's go have fun

[Chorus]
Let's go have fun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day...
Fun, you and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day...


[Verse 1]
I smell heartbreak on my hands
I feel sick to my stomach as I begin to stand
I see your outline in my bed
In the same spot I watched him rest his head
I've done you wrong, I regret it
I write this song, tryna forget it
Feel this emptiness in my chest
I feel surreal but I'm feeling stressed
I need to do something
Fucked up for nothing
Oh, I gotta just tell someone
Tell someone what I've done

[Chorus]
Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Oh no, like gasoline

[Verse 2]
Wake up the morning after
You call, but I don't answer
And I can't look you in the eye
No matter how hard I try
You deserve forever
Not a boy looking for better
But as long as you're still here
I will try to keep you near


[Chorus]
Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Oh no, like gasoline
Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Oh no, like gasoline



[Verse 1]
You shake me up and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Verse 2]
Outside it's coming down
But here inside, it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Bridge]
The winter is so gray, feels like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me, you know you melt it all away

[Chorus]
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Oh, so glittery
I love the way you decorate my heart




[Chorus]
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill (my sweet)
Take my hunger

All the sweat and conversations that
Seep into my bones (ay yeah yeah)
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the unknown
Unknown (Unknown)

[Pre-Chorus]
Glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts (wow)
Nothing but time to kill (time to kill)
Sipping life from bottles (woah)
Tight skin, bodyguards (woah)
Gucci down the boulevard (drip)
Cocaine, dollar bills and (I told my baby don't sniff)

Take my hunger

And make 'em start
Skin and bones
And flesh and blood
With all this nerve
How did we get this numb

To want a little change

If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
If a million hands can build a wall
A million hands can break it down
Ooooh



[Verse 1]
In the crowd, alone
And every second passing
Reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds
Are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

[Pre-Chorus]
All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards

Cocaine, dollar bills and

Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
The truth runs wild
Like a tear down a cheek
Trying to save face, and daddy heart break
I'm lying through my teeth
This voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to replace the love that I fake
With what we both need
The truth runs wild
Like kids on concrete
Trying to sedate, my mind in its cage
And numb what I see

Awake, wide eyed
I'm screaming at me
Trying to keep faith and picture his face
Staring up at me

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?


[Verse 2: Betty Who]
The truth runs wild
Like the rain to the sea
Trying to set straight the lines that I trace
To find some relief
This voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to embrace the picture I paint
And colour me free

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?

[Bridge: Troye Sivan]
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen


[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?

Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song

Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on

Buzzcut Season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you, but I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

Just want to go home
Want to go home
Want to go home, woah

Tired of love, tired of love (someone take me home)
Tired of love, tired of love (cause I can't be alone)
Tired of love, tired of love (I'm so tired)
Tired of love, tired of love, tired of love, tired of love



[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

[Verse 1: Lauv with Troye Sivan]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
Everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
Tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan with Lauv]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzzcut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv & Troye Sivan, Troye Sivan, Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

[Bridge: Lauv & Troye Sivan]
Somebody cover up my ears
Somebody save me from my heart
Somebody take me far from here
And rip the speakers out my car
'Cause I'm ready to love you or I'm ready to lose you
But I can't wait here any longer

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Just wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
So tired of love songs (And I'm so tired)
Tired of love, tired of love, tired of love, tired of love




[Verse 1]
I think about it
Can't think about it
Took a flight all the way home, yeah, ooh
No way around it, I still see you way up here, yeah
I'm stressed about it
Went west about it
Took a hammer to my phone, yeah, ooh
No way around it; I still hear you crystal clear

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said, you know
It's the hardest thing I've said

[Chorus]
Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
Would've thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
But you still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Can you come back?
Wait, I don't mean that, no
It's all just feeling real now (Ooh)
So far away, but I still feel you everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit (Hide my shit)
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give (I can give)
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said, you know
That's the hardest thing I've said

[Chorus]
Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
Would've thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream

[Verse 1]
I can change your life in a single night
I can make you hungry, get an appetite
I could tell a story that would make you cry
But nobody ever seems to bat an eye

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause this town's too small for a girl like me
(For a girl like me, for a girl like me)
It feels like I'm a walking tragedy
(Walking tragedy, walking tragedy)

[Chorus]
But do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder
And do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder

[Verse 2]
I give you a ticket to the midnight show
We can hit the road and we can go, go, go
Turn our faces in and you can kiss me slow
I can turn around and say I told you so


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause this town's too small for a girl like me
(For a girl like me, for a girl like me)
It feels like I'm a walking tragedy
(Walking tragedy, walking tragedy)

[Chorus]
But do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder
And do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me

[Verse 1]
As the smile fell from your face, I fell with it
Our faces blue
There's a heart stain on the carpet
I left it, I left it with you
Yeah, the truth is that I'm sorry
Though I told you not to worry
I'm just some dumb kid
Trying to kid myself
That I got my shit together
So go, get to runnin', won't you hurry?
While it's light out, while it's early
Before I start to miss any part of this
And change my mind, whatever

[Chorus]
I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run-around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found

[Verse 2]
I don't care much for locks on the window
To keep me at bay
I'll leave you one last kiss on your pillow
Before I fly away
Yeah, we knew from the beginning
That this wasn't never ending
Shouldn't stay too long
'Cause we're both too young
To give into forever


[Chorus]
I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run-around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy

[Bridge]
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

[Chorus]
I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run-around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found

Not ready to be found

I know you love me

And your locket
I heard you talk about me in the kitchen
You didn't know I was listening
But I was there, sitting on the stairs
Talk about me in the kitchen
You didn't know I was listening
But I was there, and that isn't fair

Oh, I wanna know just how to love you
The jewel of California
Oh, I wanna skip stones on your skin, boy
And drown me in your water

[Pre-Chorus]
And my boy, like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
A hit of dopamine, higher than I've ever been
He knows how to love me better

[Chorus]
'Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you

You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you, yeah
Tell me all the ways to love you, oh
Tell me all the ways to love you

Get lost the more I find ya

Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try
I can't make you need me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try

[Chorus]
But when the sun starts to set
And when the skies take your breath
And I need to sense you right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye

Until my dying breath, you know I'll try
I can't make you feel it, if it's not there

And when the skies take your breath
And I need to sense you right there

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Now we're staring at the ceiling, you're so pretty when you're mad
All that I can hear is breathing, oh, oh
And we're stuck inside the silence, in a cold, cold war
We're too proud to say we're sorry, oh, oh

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
I find refuge in the distance, even when we're breaking down
Can we pause it just for one kiss? Oh, oh
Cause I never meant to hurt you, and I know you feel the same
Still the only one I run to, oh, oh

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut


[Verse 1]
Watching you sleep
Run my hands through your hair and it's got me thinking
What you mean to me
There's a chill in the air and a sinking feeling

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Coming over me
Like bitter tangerine
Like sirens in the streets
Oh, now

[Chorus]
Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding, holding on, oh
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

[Verse 2]
Jealous, you can sleep
You've been keeping me up and I mouth the words
I think I wanna speak
Instead, I'm wasting my time just pressing rewind


[Pre-Chorus 2]
To all the nights we shared
The ripest peach or pear
But change is in the air, oh

[Chorus]
Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding, holding on, oh
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
(Got so long)

[Bridge]
I was summer, you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring
Yeah, I was summer and you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring

[Chorus]
Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding, holding on, oh
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long


[Outro]
Maybe we're overgrown
The sweetest plum
Got so long (got so long)
The sweetest plum
Has only got so long

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
I sent you a postcard from Tokyo baby
You never picked it up
I even wrote it in Japanese, baby
You didn't give a fuck

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
'Cause I don't sleep like your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between
Yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need
Yeah

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
Yeah, you're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan & Gordi]
I remember that night that you first called me crazy
Only you picked it up
Kissed me and said "I love you, baby"
You didn't give a fuck


[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan & Gordi]
Now I don't sleep unless your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between
Yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need
Yeah

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Gordi]
But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
Yeah, you're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

[Bridge: Gordi]
Take your time, pull me in, push me out
Simplify all the whispers of doubt
'Cause I know what you're thinking about

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Gordi]
But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
Yeah, you're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

[Verse 1]
Hey, you
Where you been hanging out lately? (You)
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger?
Feelin' alive, a teenager, ooh
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna go wild
I just wanna fuck shit up and just ride
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just wanna sing loud
I just wanna lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Or in his arms tonight

[Chorus]
Hey, my lil' rager teenager
Tryna figure it out
Living a season of screaming
And turning it out
Hey, my little rager teenager
I've missed you around, yeah
Missed you around


[Verse 2]
Hey, you
Where you been hanging out lately? (You)
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger?
Feelin' alive, a teenager, ooh
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here we are, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna go wild (Wild, wild)
I just wanna do some shit just to try
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just wanna sing loud
I just wanna lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Or in his arms tonight

[Chorus]
Hey, my lil' rager teenager
Tryna figure it out
Live in a season of screaming
And turning it out
Hey, my little rager teenager
I've missed you around, yeah
Missed you around

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
You're a revelation
Won't you liberate me now?
From a holy bound
You're a revolution
I will liberate you now
As the walls come down

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
It's a rocky road
To say "Maybe I won't go"
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
And you're here crushing all I'm told

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know, now

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
It's a revelation
There's no hell in what I've found
And no kingdom shout
How the tides are changing
As you liberate me now
And the walls come down

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Til' the end
It's a rocky road
To say "Maybe I won't go"
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
And you're here crushing all I'm told

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Ever I roam


[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
You're a revelation
Won't you liberate me now?
From a holy bound
You're a revolution
I will liberate you now
As the walls come down

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
It's a rocky road
To say "Maybe I won't go"
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
And you're here crushing all I'm told

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know, now

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
It's a revelation
Saw no light to strike me down
No kingdom shout
How the tides are changing
As you liberate me now
And the walls come down


[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Til' the end
It's a rocky road
To say "maybe I won't go"
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
And you're here crushing all I'm told

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know
Ever I roam



[Verse 1]
I'll keep wearing these running shoes 'til I'm all worn out
And they're no use to me
No use to me
Gunning for a peace from this abuse
'Cause I'm all tired out and I'm no use to you
No use to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

[Chorus]
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while

[Post-Chorus]
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running

[Verse 2]
Carved his name in the carpet
Right where I spent all of my sleepless nights in that room
In that room
Can't get his face out of my mind
And God knows that I've tried and tried for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

[Chorus]
I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)
I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)

[Post-Chorus]
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down

[Bridge]
Love in America, got me down
Try take off running but hit the ground
(I hit the ground)

[Post-Chorus]
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down




[Verse 1]
It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

[Chorus]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

[Verse 2]
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

[Pre-Chorus]
All the fucked up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

[Chorus]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

[Drop]
Scared to be lonely

[Bridge]
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how do we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how do we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely

[Chorus]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?




[Verse 1]
I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep, but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

[Pre-Chorus]
And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

[Chorus]
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen

[Verse 2]
You should know I'm green, but I'll find my way around
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about
I'm taking in the sights and measuring the sounds
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about

[Pre-Chorus]
And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

[Chorus]
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen

[Chorus]
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen

[Outro]
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen


[Verse]
I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

[Pre-Chorus]
And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

[Chorus]
Here he comes
Like he just walked out of a dream
Doesn't care you're seventeen
Or maybe he forgot what that means
But yeah, he comes
He comes



[Verse 1]
She's 22 and she's loving you
And you'll never know that it makes me blue
Does she make you happy?
I'm holding on to everything that's wrong
Cause we don't belong, you like my songs
And it makes me happy
Does she make you happy?

[Refrain]
You can throw away every word I say

[Verse 2]
I'm standing still on this hidden hill
And I'm looking around for the right way down
To your distant valley
Your flowers grow in the frozen snow
And I'd like to know, is it all a show?
Are you really happy? Are you really happy?

[Refrain]
Cause you can throw away every word I say
You just throw away




Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

[Verse 1]
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody
Ooh somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

[Verse 2]
I work hard
Every day of my life
I work til' I ache in my bones
At the end of the day
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Til' the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody
Ooh somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

[Outro]
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love (somebody)
Find me somebody to love (somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?


[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
(Hey, hey, hey go!)

Ladies and gentleman
Dua Lipa!

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
We are wicked men
Looking for buckles to loosen
By the Count of 10
I wanna see somebody human
And I lost what it was
In the clear blue dust
Of a Downtown Romeo
In a couple of weeks
You can tell all the freaks
How you carried my body home

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But tonight I crossed the line
Dear Mr. Lonely
How much could you know me?
I could find lessons in light
But once you've earned it
You've already burned it


[Chorus: Dua Lipa, Troye Sivan]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
Woo!

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan, Dua Lipa]
Got my ticket man and I'm looking
For somebody to use it
I know we pretend
But one of these days
We're gonna lose it
And I once left town
When the leaves turned brown
With a couple of souvenirs
She was in my car
When we hit that wall
Yeah it could've move me to tears

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But tonight I crossed the line
I used to know her
When my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
But once it's over, it's all really over


[Chorus: Dua Lipa, Troye Sivan]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
(Hey, hey, hey!)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa, with Troye Sivan, Troye Sivan]
But tonight I crossed the line
I used to know her
When my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
Over and over, is it really over?

[Chorus: Dua Lipa, Troye Sivan]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life

[Verse 1]
Remember when we first met?
You said, "Light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mum and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

[Chorus]
Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

[Verse 2]
Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change
But we went right back to your games


[Chorus]
Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

[Bridge]
And even if I run away
Give my heart a holiday
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you, you
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you

[Chorus]
Headlights on me
(And even if I run away)
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
(Give my heart a holiday)
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
(You always leave me wanting more)
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
(I can't shake my hunger for)
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

[Chorus]
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, tough
What's it like to be so big and strong and so buff?
Everything I'm not
But could I still be a hunk to you?
Enough for you, a stud to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse]
Taking the fun out of fucks
Searching for something I'm not
Knowing that you're not the one
(You're the one for right now, yeah)
How much of me would you take?
And how much of me would you change?
On second thought, don't say a thing
('Cause you're the one for right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
Just let me believe that
You like what you're seeing
When you're looking at me
And your heartbeat is speeding
At seven hundred miles down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eating
Yeah


[Chorus]
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh)
(Stud, stud)
(Oh)

[Chorus]
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
You're into this, right?
We should do this right
You can make my night
We should do this right
You're into this, right?
We should do this right
You can make my night
We should do this, right?
Right?


[Outro]
Just let me believe that
You like what you're seeing
When you're looking at me
And your heartbeat is speeding
The seven hundred miles
Down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eating
Yeah
You're into this (Mmm)
We should do this (Mmm)
You're into this (Mmm)
You can make my night (Mmm)
You're into this, right?
You can make my night
You're into this, right?
You can make my night
You're into this
My night
Mmm

This song hasn't been released yet



[Verse 1]
The sun sets longer
Where I am from
Where dreams go to die
While having fun
The boys fix their cars and
Girls eat it up
Loving's so good when
Love is young

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia

[Verse 2]
Swallow nostalgia
Chase it with lime
Better than dwelling
And chasing time
Missing occasions
I can't rewind
Can't help but feel I've lost what's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia

[Bridge]
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia




[Verse 1]
The sun sets longer
Where I am from
Where dreams go to die
While having fun
Boys fix their cars and
Girls eat it up
Lovin's so good when
Love is young

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
So much history in my head
The people I loved
The ones that I've...

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia, woah
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia, woah

[Verse 2]
Swallow nostalgia
Chase it with lime
Better than dwelling
And chasing time
Missin' occasions
I can't rewind
Can't help feel I've lost what's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
So much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've...

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia, woah, woah

[Bridge]
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces
Oh, they all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
There's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
So much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I...

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia, woah
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia, woah, woah

[Outro]
Oh, woah
Oh-oh...




[Verse 1]
Rose girls in glass vases
Perfect bodies, perfect faces
They all belong in magazines
Those girls the boys are chasing
Winning all the games they're playing
They're always in a different league

[Pre-Chorus]
Stretching toward the sky like I don't care
Wishing you could see me standing there

[Chorus]
But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I were a rose, maybe you'd want me
If I could, I'd change overnight
I'd turn into something you'd like
But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I were a rose, maybe you'd pick me
But I know you don't have a clue
This sunflower's waiting for you
Waiting for you
But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
And if I were her, maybe you'd pick me
But I know you don't have a clue
This sunflower's waiting for you
Waiting for you


[Verse 1]
Rose girls in glass vases

But I know you don't have a clue
This sunflower's waiting for you
Waiting for you

[Verse 2]
No thorns in this dimension
Hiding this fear of rejection
This high I've never felt so small
Not used to this attention
Permanently in suspension
I wish I didn't care at all


[Pre-Chorus]
Stretching toward the sky like I don't care
Wishing you could see me standing there

[Chorus]
But I'm a sunflower, a little funny

If I could, I'd change overnight
And turn into something you'd like

[Intro]
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

[Verse 1]
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
'Cause I just wanna be at the start of after loving you
I plant my feet and I clench my teeth
I can't outrun what's coming after me
So tell me, how am I gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools?

[Chorus]
But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there till I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out on the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools

[Post-Chorus]
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

[Verse 2]
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
Tell me how I'm gonna feel less secure when I look at you
So I close my eyes and just visualise
The greener skies on the other side
So tell me, how am I gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools?

[Chorus]
But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there till I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out on the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools

[Post-Chorus]
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run


[Chorus]
I'm tired of the city, scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die, let's die somewhere pretty, ah, ah-ah
Sad in the summer, city needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time, then it's time to go
Take yourself home

[Verse 1]
Talk to me
There's nothing that can't be fixed with some honesty
And how it got this dark is just beyond to me
If anyone can hear me, switch the lights, oh, oh
And happiness
Is right there where you lost it when you took the bet
Counting all the losses that you can't collect
Got everything and nothing in my life

[Chorus]
I'm tired of the city, scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die, let's die somewhere pretty, ah, ah-ah
Sad in the summer, city needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time, then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

[Verse 2]
Who you really tryna be when they see your face?
Is it worth it tryna win in a losing game?
Well, it's all waiting for you
And boy, I know you're eager
But it just might destroy you
Destroy you, yeah


[Chorus]
I'm tired of the city, scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die, let's die somewhere pretty, ah, ah-ah
Sad in the summer, city needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time, then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take yourself home
Home, oh

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
'Cause you know that I can't trust myself with my 3-AM shadow
I'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone

[Chorus]
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down

[Verse 2]
I wanna hold hands with you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna get close to you
'Cause your hands and lips still know their way around
And I know I like to draw the line when it starts to get too real
But the less time that I spend with you, the less you need to heal

[Chorus]
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down
(Talk me down)


[Bridge]
So if you don't mind, I'll walk that line
Stuck on the bridge between us
Grey areas and expectations
But I'm not the one if we're honest, yeah
But I wanna sleep next to you
And I wanna come home to you
I wanna hold hands with you
I wanna be close to you

[Outro]
But I wanna sleep next to you
And that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
So come over now and talk me down
(Talk me down)

[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'-

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
And I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)

One time on Twitter, I heard Ariana was pregnant
So I got pregnant so we can pregnant at the same time
Turns out it was just a rumor

[Jonathan Bennett]
Ariana Grande told me my hair looks sexy pushed back
She's not wrong

[Stefanie Drummond]
Ariana broke off an engagement
So I found a guy to propose to me
And I broke off an engagement

[Troye Sivan]
I heard she's a lesbian now
And dating some chick called Aubrey
It's fucking sick

[Scott Nicholson]
I heard if you recorded her snoring
And play it backwards it sounds like fantasia

[Gabi DeMartino]
Ariana said, "honest to God knock me out"
So I decided to punch myself in the face
It was awesome


[Ariana Grande]
I mean, he was really cute you know?
He was really cute
And it was, it was really big

[Jennifer Coolidge]
Well, I've only gone out with one guy
That had a big front tooth
And I liked it 'cause he never got anything stuck in the front teeth
But, have you ever gone out with someone that had no teeth at all?

[Ariana Grande]
No

[Kris Jenner]
Thank u next, bitch!

[Verse 1]
One Direction took over the world
All the boys and Harry's curly curls
And Obama's back, I guess he's a hit
Thank you, US, cause Mitt Romney's a shit
Gangnam Style took over the tubes
The London Olympics were pretty huge
Drake told people You Only Live Once
Hashtag YOLO son
Carly Jepsen said call me maybe
And Justin said, that's not my...

[Chorus]
In 2012, ooh, in 2012
In 2012, aah, in 2012

[Verse 2]
Kony please stop acting like a prick
The producer of that played with his...
Cole Sprouse joined Tumblr, we said hello
But now he's just somebody that we used to know
Somebody, somebody
That dude Felix jumped from the sky
Everyone thought, "he's gonna die"
Swag, swag, swag on you
Personally, I started vlogging too!


[Chorus]
In 2012, ooh, in 2012
In 2012, aah, in 2012

[Bridge]
The world ended, we all got owned
Oh wait, shit, sorry, that was postponed

[Chorus]
In 2012, ooh, in 2012

In 2012, ooh, in 2012

[Chorus]
Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick ass year

[Verse 1]
Miley went on twerked on stage
Made the whole world fill with rage
But she sold records, like she was taught
And then came around little old Lorde

Speaking of royals, they had a baby
And then came out - Mr. Tom Daley
The world's realising that it's not a choice
I'm still Troye, I just happen to like boys
(What? I like boys
Have you seen their butts? Exactly)

Robin Thicke went to Number 1
Even though the song was sexist and dumb
Yeah that's right, I'm talking Blurred Lines
But oh shit wait, let's talk about Amanda Bynes

Everybody says she went a bit koo-koo
Telling Drake he should murder her hoo-hoo
We say she's the one who's going cray
But here we are asking What The Fox Say?

[Chorus]
Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick ass year

[Verse 2]
The US Government needed a break
Probably to go do the Harlem Shake
Catching Fire was good, dudes
Got me as excited as the Dylan Sprouse nudes

The 1D boys said This Is Us
Beyonce dropped an album without a fuss
Rest in peace to Nelson Mandela
To you Madiba, we're indebted forever

[Chorus]
Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick ass year

Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick ass year


[Verse 1]
The weight
Of a simple human emotion
Weighs me down
More than the tank ever did
The pain
It's determined and demanding to ache,
But I'm okay...

[Chorus]
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you
And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you

[Verse 2]
You lost a part of your existence
In the war, against yourself
Oh, the lights
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you it's time to go

[Chorus]
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you
And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you


[Bridge]
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

[Chorus]
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you
And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you

[Outro]
With you



[Verse 1]
I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
The change in the wind took you down to your knees
I got the good side of you
Send it out into the blue
The people danced to the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart

[Chorus]
But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

[Verse 2]
I got the good side of life
Travelled the universe twice
So many thoughts I wanted to share
But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
Then I got the good side of new
Found arms to fall right into
I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
And some day I hope that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

[Bridge]
I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
And catch up on everything
I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

[Chorus]
But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
Sympathize, recognize
Apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things


[Verse 1]
I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze

The people danced to the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart

[Verse 1]
Holding on to secrets
Gripping handle bars on the road
Racing home at sunset
With the last light into the glow

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I let you love me right back
Ooh, it's easy how we lose track

[Chorus]
We talk all night, we talk all day
Wish I could meet you on the other side
The bedroom lights keep us awake
Wish I could meet you on the other side
On the other side, on the other side
On the other side, on the other side
(The other side, oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
Taking in this moment
Say "I love you" under my breath
Though your heart is stolen
It's like your voice is right in my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I let you love me right back
Ooh, it's easy how we lose track

[Chorus]
We talk all night, we talk all day
Wish I could meet you on the other side
The bedroom lights keep us awake
Wish I could meet you on the other side
On the other side, on the other side
(The other side, the other side)
On the other side, on the other side

On the other side
On the other side, yeah
On the other side




[Verse 1]
Holding on to secrets
Gripping handle bars on the road
Racing home at sunset
With the last light into the glow

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I let you love me right back
Ooh, it's easy how we lose track

[Chorus]
We talk all night, we talk all day
Wish I could meet you on the other side (Other side)
The bedroom lights keep us awake
Wish I could meet you on the other side (Other side)

[Post-Chorus]
On the other side, on the other side
On the other side, on the other side

[Verse 2]
Taking in this moment
Say "I love you" under my breath
Though your heart is stolen
It's like your voice is right in my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I let you love me right back
Ooh, it's easy how we lose track

[Chorus]
We talk all night, we talk all day
Wish I could meet you on the other side
The bedroom lights keep us awake
Wish I could meet you on the other side

[Post-Chorus]
On the other side, on the other side
On the other side, on the other side


[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Growing distance, free of explanation
We're getting deeper in this mess
Take careful contemplation
I'd rather be spittin' blood
Than have this silence fuck me up

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
This separation, time and space between us
For some revelation
You didn't care to discuss
I'd rather be black and blue
Than accept that you withdrew

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Aaah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

[Verse 3: Troye Sivan]
Used to give each other the world, every bit
Used to be the one you'd come to
When it'd all go to shit
Now I'm left here in the dust
With the taste of broken trust


[Verse 4: Troye Sivan]
And I don't wanna walk away
But you left me no choice
Only talking to myself here
Now you've muffled your voice
I'd rather have broken bones
Than feel myself turn to stone

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Aaah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

[Bridge: Troye Sivan]
I don't mind that I know that you're wrong
I don't mind that you think you're right
All I want is a fight to fight
Anything but quiet

[Outro: Troye Sivan]
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
I woke up pissed off today
And lately, everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too

[Breakdown: Troye Sivan]
But you gotta be there for me too

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end


[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you

I'll be loud for you

[Bridge: Troye Sivan]
I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

[Breakdown: Troye Sivan]
But you gotta be there for me too

[Bridge: Troye Sivan]
Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Said I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
But you gotta be there for me too

When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

[Bridge: Troye Sivan]
I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

[Breakdown: Troye Sivan]
But you gotta be there for me too

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too


[Verse 1]
Babe, you know I regret those words
Bombs that you did not deserve
Well alright, alright
And hey, usually just takes a day
Before we're on a brand new page
Alright, well that's fine

[Pre-Chorus]
We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
Taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's all alright

[Chorus]
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (How do we?)
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (How do we?)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this


[Verse 2]
Ties can tangle up and become knots
Gotta work so that we don't get caught
Alright, alright
And I will take myself to the front line
I don't care if it's taking all night
It's alright, it's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
Taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's all alright

[Chorus]
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (How do we?)
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (How do we?)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this


[Interlude]
Something wrong 'bout to keep in on top
Nothing wrong 'cause we know when to stop
Something wrong 'bout to keep in on top
Nothing wrong 'cause we know when to stop

[Chorus]
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we? (Yeah, yeah)
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (How do we?)
(No, I don't wanna, I don't wanna let go)
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close? (Oh yeah, yeah)
I don't want to let go (How do we?)

Through just about the craziest storms and whirlwinds I can imagine, Ariana Grande remains the most real person I've met. I've always thought the world is privy to actual, genuine emotion-be it heartbreak, empathy, generosity, resilience, strength-and I believe that's exactly why the world keeps falling deeper in love with Ariana. Wearing her heart on her sleeve and in her work, she oozes those emotions in abundance. Armed with a full comprehension of how the world consumes music today, she is an industry game changer. Having released not one but two critically acclaimed, record-breaking albums just a few months apart-the latter, Thank U, Next, was written in just a few weeks-Ari is breaking the rules and is a force who understands how music should work in 2019. Her love of her fans and of music guide her every move. But my favorite moments with Ari are the quieter ones. When I, like so many, have been inspired by that resilience, love, care and heart in someone I'm lucky to call my friend.

Now she's the biggest artist in the world, and that's kind of a no-brainer to me. I can't wait to see what she does next.



[Verse 1]
Scared my love, you'll go
Spend my love, heart broke
So my love don't show
Scared my love, you'll go

[Chorus]
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need

[Verse 2]
Fingers walk your thigh
Breathe my love, get high
And oh, I'm so scared
Oh, I'm so scared
It's just for tonight

[Refrain]
So I take a sip, wait till it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you

[Chorus]
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need

[Refrain]
So I take a sip, wait till it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Chorus]
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need


[Verse 1]
Glow is low and it's dimming
And the silence is ringing
I can almost feel your breath
I can almost feel the rest
Night is young and we're living
Hands move, moving steady
The time's moving slower
I can feel we're getting closer, closer, yeah

[Chorus]
Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam to the curl of your lips
And the centre of eclipse
In total darkness I reach out and touch

[Verse 2]
My mind's gone a-racing
On a horse that's escaping
And I'm ready to jump, yeah, I'm ready to swim
Life is chances that are taken
But nothing's ever broken
They're just pieces on the ground
Your hands need to build them
My mind's gone running
My hands cut loose
But there's no need for answers
Just the things you gotta do


[Bridge]
And I need you to trust that I'm lost
And we must get past all these rules
We must choose to reach out and touch

[Chorus]
Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam to the curl of your lips
And the centre of eclipse
In total darkness I reach out and
Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam to the curl of your lips
And the centre of eclipse
In total darkness I reach, I reach out and touch

[Chorus]
We got the classic image
We got the glossy finish
Bringing back all that good shit
Our love is vintage, uh huh
We're driving through the moonlight
Touching you just like you like
Every kiss is timeless
Our love is vintage, uh huh

[Verse 1]
In a fast car on a late night
And I'm staring at your jawline
You're killing me slowly
(You're killing me slowly)
Now you're laying me on the sofa
In a cloud of marijuana
You're getting to know me

[Pre-Chorus]
I need someone to love me right
Who will give me peace of mind
Who gon' be there day and night
Alright, uh huh

[Chorus]
We got the classic image

Bringing back all that good shit

Touching you just like you like
Every kiss is timeless
Our love is vintage, uh huh
Our love is vintage, uh huh
Our love is vintage, uh huh

[Verse 2]
Feel the bassline on the speaker
And my waistline on your fingers
You're killing me slowly
(You're killing me slowly) Uh huh
Now we're dancing on the border
So romantic, pull me closer
And right there you told me, uh huh

[Pre-Chorus]
You need someone to love you right
Who will give you peace of mind
Who gon' be there day and night
Well alright, uh huh

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Valentines Day is creeping up on me
Still staring at you on my computer screen
Writing a fan-fic in the middle of the night
Because, you know, this will bring us closer, right?
"You've never met them" the peasant cried
Shut the fuck up bitch, do you want to die?
I've told you before, are you deaf?
I've fallen in love with a GIF

[Chorus]
OTP, we're my
OTP, baby you and me
We'd be so sexy
OTP, we're my
OTP, baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

[Verse 2]
Bieber fever, One Direction infection
Whatever floats your boat, what's your addiction
And you, Tumblr, you make it so much worse
You make me feel the feels, right where it hurts
I'll love you always, I'll love you 5ever
I'll love you as much as I love Nutella (almost)


[Chorus]
OTP, we're my
OTP, baby you and me
We'd be so sexy
OTP, we're my
OTP, baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

[Outro]
OTP, we're my
OTP, baby you and me
We'd be so sexy
OTP, we're my
OTP, (We're my OTP, baby)
Baby you and me (OTP, OTP)
We'd be so sexy



[Verse 1]
Tell each other you're the one
While we're laying by the poolside, poolside
Getting tired from the sun
Fading in and out of long nights, long nights
There's no limit to your love
East or west we got the north lights, north lights
Oh oh, take in it all

[Chorus]
What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

[Verse 2]
When our prime has come and gone
And our youth is all but melted, melted
We can listen to this song
So we don't have to accept it, accept it
Just as long as you'll be home
In the world we've manifested-fested
Oh oh, just take in it all

[Chorus]
What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

[Bridge]
Just take it in all, all, all, all
Just take it in all, all, all, all
Just take it in all, all, all, all
Just take it in all, all, all, all

[Chorus]
What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you


Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

We're alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind?


Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Bend, and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
You make my heart shake
Bend, and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

[Chorus]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good
And it drives me wild
'Cause when you look like that
Never ever wanted to be so bad
And it drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild


[Intro]
(Heart shake)
(Bend and break)
(But I can't turn away)
(And it's driving me)

[Verse 1]
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool
Ow yeah

[Chorus]
You're driving me

[Verse 2]
White noise in my mind
Won't calm down
You're all I think about
Running on the music
And night highs
But when the light's out
It's me and you now, now


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool
Ow yeah

[Chorus]
Wanted to
Wanted to be, be, bad
Never, never
Driving me wild, (wild)
Wanted to
Wanted to be, be, bad
Never, never
Driving me wild, (wild)

[Bridge]
Heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild


[Chorus]
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild

[Bridge]
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

[Remix Instrumental Break]


[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
We're alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind?

[Pre Chorus: Alessia Cara + Troye Sivan]
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

[Remix Instrumental Break]


[Outro]
You're driving me...
You're driving me...
You're driving me...
You're driving me...
You're driving me wild

[Verse 1]
What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna grow up
I wanna stay young 'till I had enough
I'm keeping my youth 'till my youth grows up
But if you know me you know that's a bluff
We've got people 'tryna live their whole life by the safest route
Trying to live their life just like everyone else
But if your God gave you a gift then you can expect for him to give you a chance to make him more profound with it
I'm not saying life will be easy no
I'm just saying that life will come and go
So you can expect for me to take this life and do with it what I feel that my God has given me to show
So ignore the risk and take the fall
And if it's meant to be it'll be worth it all
Don't be immune to your blessings, but trust in them
But trust in God and God will bless you, oh


[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Verse 1]
What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Verse 2]
What if, what if we start to drive?
What if, what if we close our eyes?
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body; timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go


[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Outro]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth is yours
My youth is yours
