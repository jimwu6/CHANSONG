[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake, you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself


[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Part II: The Catch Up]

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

[Verse 2]
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real


[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up



[Intro: The Game]
Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

[Verse 1: The Game]
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, "Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?"
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
"We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical"
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 3: The Game]
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, "Here it go"
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Chorus]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 1]
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

[Chorus]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 2]
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

[Chorus]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 3]
I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

[Chorus]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Outro]
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri




[Verse 1]
Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G though
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Baby girl on that Mclaren
You gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could
You know what it is, Drake and Tim Westwood




You're from Timmins and I'm from Toronto
You worked at McDonald's and I eat McDonald's
We should be together, I think we should be together
All these other girls they're totally crazy, oh, oh, oh
Only you can make me feel the way I feel
Damn, I'm dying to make you feel like a woman, baby




The first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was "Pon de Replay," and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called "Work."

Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.

Captivating from day one, the iconic being that is Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, that's often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.

When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style, she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.

What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.

This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one.

She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.

Yeah, Pluto, he just spilt a sumo with me, now I'm sideways
I could park a hundred Escalades in my driveway
They be rockin' ice but then they talkin' like it's Friday
Next nigga to call me out, I'm goin' on a tirade (Yeah)
Yeah, my birthday in the 6ix gon' be a holiday
I say I need a table for like thirty, they accommodate
Women [?] down the interstate
Take her from Dominican and make that shawty immigrate

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
I'm a headache to society
Real shit, Kylie Jenner, that's a side piece
I got twenty mothafuckin' Kylies
Nigga, I got twenty damn Kylies

[Bridge: Future & Young Thug]
I got twenty, twenty damn Kylies (Woo)
I got, twenty, twenty grams of Molly
I got, I got twenty big bodies (Woo)
I got twenty bitches outside (Hey)


21 salute

[The Weeknd Sample]

“They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving this crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving this crew”

[Drake Sample]
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Chorus]
Let me tell you a truth
It is amazing what this game could do to you
Fake cold may lose your soul too
And if you  a fuu, the hook can get you though
If you knew what I do
What I went through
Thank you to the crew, I salute you
And if you go, I will give you a 21 salute as if you are camo
And we are good fellas mixed with regular dudes
So who knows if it could be me or you to salute


[Verse 1]
Like they say in the marines
Everyone wants to go to heaven
But no one wants to go with sleep’s cousin
And with death, it is not the greatest loss, but the greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive
And that is far worse crime if it kills time
But I guess it is also good to go with pride
And I want to express what’s inside outside but my enemies want to see my insides outside and I got to bottle it up and make whatever outside inside

[Chorus]
Let me tell you a truth
It is amazing what this game could do to you
Fake cold may lose your soul too
And if you  a fuu, the hook can get you though
If you knew what I know
What I went through
Thank you to the crew, I salute you
And if you go, I will give you a 21 salute as if you are camo
And we are good fellas mixed with regular dudes
So who knows if it could be me or you to salute

Where is your backbone, or your code at
A paradox that that make the real die quick
It’s hard to separate friends from enemies
Always show love but in their hearts they envy me and wait for the right opportunity to backstab me
Ride for me but still sell me
I got to ask dogs cause they have better answers than those snakes in disguise
But I guess righteous choices don’t pay no more and only god knows
But I promise for my crew I will hold you down


[Chorus]
Let me tell you a truth
It is amazing what this game could do to you
Fake cold may lose your soul too
And if you  a fuu, the hook can get you though
If you knew what I know
What I went through
Thank you to the crew, I salute you
And if you go, I will give you a 21 salute as if you are camo
And we are good fellas mixed with regular dudes
So who knows if it could be me or you to salute

Headstart, ready for war, raise your sword and play with fire
War without failure with a taste of pleasure and pain
Change the system, new gen revolution
Shifting powers, new forms of throne
Fear of getting out the zone
Pressure of making the right move
Play it wrong, you may lose your soul too

[21 Savage Sample Outro]
I'd rather have loyalty than love
'Cause love really don't mean jack
See love is just a feeling
You can love somebody and still stab them in they back
It don't take much to love
You can love somebody just by being attached
See loyalty is a action
You can love or hate me and still have my back



[I: 2 On]

[Intro: OB O'Brien & YG]
Let's get it, I can't wait to trick, man

[Outro: Drake]
I love to get on, I love to get two on
I love to get on, I love to get two
She loves to get on, she loves to get two on
She loves to get on, she loves to get two

[II: Thotful"]

[Verse: Drake]
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad, girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasin' that paper
Even though you're exhausted, you're still gonna make it, girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so

And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something you know
And you know, you love to get two on

Drop down, drop-drop (Shit is real out here)
Drop down, drop-drop
Drop down, drop-drop, get it, get it
Drop down, drop-drop

[Chorus: Detail]
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it

We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it

[Verse 1: Drake]
They don't work hard as you, damn that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl you just did it
I get it I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit
12 months on the lease, that's a come up baby don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man
The spark ain't enough for you

[Chorus: Detail]
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it

[Verse 2: Drake]
Tonight was your night, go get you some lobsters and shrimp

I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it you did it
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm working too hard let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city, heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl get your paperwork right"
I get it I get it, what's up for the night?

[Chorus: Detail]
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it

[Outro: Drake]
Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday
You just go to LIV after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymore


[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse]
Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I'll say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together (6)
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga, out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google, yeah
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle, then take a girl to the movies
They been droppin' out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghostride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready case we need to retire your jersey, yeah
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championship celebrations durin' regular season
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Aw, nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to "Closer to My Dreams"
Wide-eyed and uneducated at nineteen
I can't rap like that, all young and naïve
Not after all the shit I seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
Four thousand square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna see you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passin' to you all of the sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put they arm around you, now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number 'cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you
Or convince you that they care and see where it goes from there, but
These ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The hate is just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie, then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep the shit to ourself
Papi champú, young Pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I.
And Young Dro was poppin' off with "Ain't I"
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doin' macarena
But, who am I to complain now? I'm still around, they know
Yeah

[Intro: Arthur Russell]
Baby lion goes
Where the islands go

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You say you never saw this comin', well, you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ándale, ándale E.I, E.I, uh-oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though

[Chorus: Kanye West]
But I still drove 30 hours
And I, I still drove 30 hours to you, yeah


[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, three stars for you
You call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time
Well, I guess a blowjob's better than no job

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I drove back 30 hours

[Bridge: Arthur Russell]
Where the main ties onto the sail
Better on sighting
For astern, oh


[Outro: Kanye West & André 3000]
3 Stacks, can you help me out?
30 hours
Yeah, this type of shit you just ride out to

The pyramids shall rise

[Intro: Birdman]

Yeah, so priceless
Life's so priceless nigga, you understand me? It's just like that
My car so priceless, my bitch so priceless, my familia is so priceless nigga, ya understand me?
Either you wit us, or you ain't wit us
Or either you in the huddle or yall could huddle
Either you ridin up or we pass some flyin by sayin "Fuck it"
It's Young Money Cash Money playboy
That's bout the size up
At the rooftop, so hot up in here nigga
Yeah, let's go

[Chorus: Drake]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, all hail Mr. Lyrical
Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?
I can show you new things, have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes - miwacles
Yeah, okay, they say that I'm the one, in fact
Some say that I'm their favorite but I ain't hearing none of that
I’m about my team, ho, Young Money running back
Cash Money superstar, where the fuck is Stunna at?
Damn


[Verse 2: Birdman]
Untouchable 40 with my AK
Mastermind, big money heavy weight
On the grind, flipping money in every way
Headline, my bitch shine everyday
Pearl white Don P, Marc Jacobs gloves
Cartier Louis case with a dope plod
From the mud where they what you leave in your blood
Going in, flipping hundreds get the young plug
Show ‘em where it go
Floating on the floor, getting more dough
Grind hard, go, black diamond show, watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded? Cash no go
And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow
And how you stay shining? Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro
Diamond minks, fur, February snow

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown (CJ)
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around (yeah)
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown (Stunna)
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground


[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, you know you paid when you got Baby with ya
It's Young Money like Ben Frank's baby pictures
I’m a lady twister, I kiss her whiskers
I been running this shit - blisters
Sticking to the script: movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car running
I’m a big smoker, I’m a little drinker
My peace sign is just the trigger and the middle finger
Wha-what you know about it, man ya’ll clueless
I let two women ride me, that's car-poolers
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers
If y'all in the building then we are intruders
Simmer down, pimpin', let me handle this
I know the game: analyst
Man I’m the shit, and y'all janitors
Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the cameras

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound (Tunechi)
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town (Yeah)
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground


[Outro: Birdman]
I see you boy
Mula, ya [?]
Behind the sky
Who next, [?], believe that
[?] cloud and smoke, yeah
We up here boy
Straight over old school, just like
Just like that, CMB
Drizzy, 1 hunnid
Brr-eah

[Verse]
Yeah
All you self-promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since "No Scrubs" and "No Pigeons"
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs
They hit my phone like, "You did that"
They even hit my line like, "Where you been at?"
It's always on some shit like
"When can I get a favor?" or, "Where my bitch at?"
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?"
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this
Yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind


[Outro]
Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this, uh
I'ma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha, ha
Bad breed, bad bwoy
Uh-huh, yeah
That's right, yeah

Lyrics from snippet

[Intro: Conway the Machine]
You know, this shit gettin' too easy lately
M-M-M-Murda
Look

[Verse 1: Conway the Machine]
As we all know, consistency is key
And nobody been this efficient more consistently than me
This the shit niggas play when they in the kitchen with a ki
Maybe two, whippin' it to three, they listenin' to me (Talk to 'em)
Look, I had reality stars tryna seduce me first (Hah)
Seen her on Instagram sellin' Nutraburst (Hahahaha)
Tummy tea and waist trainers
Yeah, she tryna run her money up, so I can't blame her (Not at all)
The way I turn over my bucks, I can leave the league
But I ain't [?], I'm stayin' me, I will lead the league
But I ain't changin', elevatin', doin' more, I'm not just maintainin'
That's why I hate when I see a nigga
And I ask him what's been up with him and he say maintainin'
That shit be weighin' on my brain and I ain't [?]
Eighty pointers up in the necklace (Huh)
Insane jungle boys sellin' cookies 'cause I'm connected (Woo)
Yeah, whip it in the pot, this shit is lockin' (Cap)
I really play with a bird like I'm Dennis Johnson (Hah)
While niggas milly rockin', we got the city poppin' (Uh huh)
Twenty-K on Rodeo what I consider shoppin'
I can tell your record deal was horrible
I got rich on my own, that's real applaudable (Talk to 'em)
This new album a wave, boy, I'm feelin' nautical
Sold crack on May Street, now I'm in Billboard articles (Uh huh)
Shot in the head, they said my grill ain't marketable (Okay)
Now I get DMs from bitches sayin'
"I seen you lookin' good on Jimmy Fallon show, that's real remarkable" (Hah)
Hundred-K on my wrist, how's that still affordable?
Machine


[Verse 2: Drake]

[Intro]
Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though

[Verse]
Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?


[Outro]
Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah

Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
...and wanna take your ass up and down the court
[?]
Fly across the border to the 416, 416, 416

[Verse 2: Drake]
Oh, come up of that motherfuckin' fame nigga

[Produced by Boi-1da and SykSense]

[Intro]
Rrrr Ting (Brrt, brrt)

[Verse]
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (Ga, grrra-ga-ga-ga-ga)
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy (Watch that)
Get hurt, boy (Get hurt)
Aww, here go another muhfucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy (First)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy (Work)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy (Work)
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy (Worst)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business (Get it)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
Rolling swishers, hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it (Naw)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (Why?)
You too worried 'bout the bitches (What you worried 'bout?)
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it (Try a ting)
She'll admit it, she'll admit it (Try a ting)
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished (Why?)
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy (Hot up in the 6)
Shit hot up in the 6 right now
Shit hot up in the 6, boy (Hot up in the 6)
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now (Ga, ga, ga)
Come see us and get it fixed, boy (Hey)
Black Benz on the road, boy (On the road)
Already had a Rolls Royce (On the road)
Sold a couple Bentley last week
Them were my old toys (Man, this shit is old)
I give a fuck about old boy (Man, that boy old)
I give a fuck about his squad, boy (Man, that thing old)
I give a fuck about your mob, boy (Oh)
I'm the real 6 God, boy (Whoa)
I'm about to say a true thing (Yeah)
I'm about to say a true thing (Yeah)
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
Goddamn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
Yeah, so I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Boomin out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm (Lou)
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like MacGyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

[Chorus]
(Yeah) Work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Work, work the night shift)

[Verse 2]
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with nigga's souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

[Chorus]
(Yeah) Work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Work, work the night shift)
(Lou)

[Outro]
If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I've never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me




[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to "R.I.P." about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it

[Outro]
Yeah, gotta love it
*Laughs*
Yeah




[Intro]
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
Sing it, sing it

I know you care
Smack it, smack it
Smack it, smack it
In the air
Smack it, smack it, in the air

[Chorus]
Wave your hands side to side, put it in the air
Clap, clap, clap like you don't care
Smack that, clap, clap, clap, like you don't care

[Verse 1]
Clap it, clap it, clap it, clap it
Foot up, my foot up, hold up, now my foot up (Spinnin')
I'm spinnin', my foot up, foot up, yeah my foot up (Spinnin')
I'm spinnin', my foot up, put my foot down, yeah my hands up (Drank)

[Bridge]
Hold that cup like alcohol, hold that cup like alcohol
Hold that cup like alcohol, don't you drop that alcohol
Never drop that alcohol, never drop that alcohol
I know I'm thinkin' 'bout alcohol, I know I'm thinkin' 'bout that alcohol

[Verse 2]
Man this feel like rollin' dice, damn this feel like rollin' dice
Seven eleven, seven eleven, seven twice, man, seven twice
Man, this feel like rollin' dice, damn, this feel like rollin' dice
Man, this feel like rollin' dice, seven twice, seven twice
Man, I'm tryna kick it with ya, damn, I wanna kick it with ya
Man I'm tryna kick it with ya, I spin around and I kick it with ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoulders sideways, smack it, smack it in the air
Legs movin' side to side, smack it in the air
Legs movin' side to side, smack it in the air
Shoulders movin' side-to-side, smack it in the air
Smack it in the air, smack it, smack it in the air
Smack it in the air
I know you care

[Outro]
Wave ya hands side to side
Wave ya hands side to side
Wave ya hands from side to side
Wave ya hands side to side
Ooh wee Bey be freaky deaky, think me see she pink bikini
Rock that groovy dye dashiki, Nefertiti, edges kinky
Sweatin' out my blow out, sweatin' out my press
This trick about to go off, mad 'cause I'm so fresh
Fresher than you, fresher than you
Fresher than you, oh


[Intro: Drake]
Too rich for who? Y'all just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
I've never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight, we like to, we like to, we like to—
Yeah, if shit was at a eight, we like to make it ten
1da sent this in, I'm goin' up all the way
I don't like to talk when there's nothin' else left to say (True)

[Chorus: Drake]
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin' play, your trainer is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— (True)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I gotta breathe real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole 'nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only blessed when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin' to (True)
And the product is still the best though
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate man, I had to Copperfield like presto
Voilà, tada (True)

[Bridge: Drake]
Never a matter of "could I?" or "should I?"
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—


[Verse 2: Drake]
Miss makin' 'em pay
Helipad from Will Smith crib straight to the stage
Three Forum shows but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is smokey, y'all stay safe in this place (True)

[Chorus: Drake]
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your niggas is pressin' play, your nanny is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— (True)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to go and hit reset, now we here
I been on top for three sets of three years
I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with
I can't fly if I could sit on the wing of that shit (True)
I try to pay it less mind
They been keepin' tabs on me like I'm payin' next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys (True)

[Bridge: Drake]
Yeah, never a matter of "could I?" or "should I?"
Kiss my mom on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—


[Outro: Plies]
Hahaha, I can't argue with you, no! You mad!
Look at you, you mad! You big mad! Haheheh
I'm happy! Leave me alone!
I just want some money, a lot of money
I don't get paid to argue with you
No! Who is you? You ain't nobody!
You mad

[Intro]
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)


[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Outro]
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am....

[Verse]
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, "I guess it does" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah


[Outro]
Uh, yeah, this what yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup
June 15th in this bitch wasup
Noel That’s it Ahhhhhh

[Intro: Drake]
Ho, yeah, uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her


[Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

[Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game


[Bridge: Trey Songz]
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)

[Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

[Alternate Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

[Verse 2]

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Alternate Hook]

[Verse 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, I just got clean rap
I don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me

[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!


[Verse 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy


[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Outro]
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down

[Verse 2: Jade Thirlwall & All]
Slaving in the kitchen, iced you a cake
Then I served you a plate, but that ain't what you ate, no

While we listen to Drake, we on that hot love and emotion


[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne Pinnock with All]
I never had somebody who

So come on baby, baby, come on, pretty baby

[Verse 3: Leigh-Anne Pinnock & All]
Excuse me, do me or lose me
Get me to the bedroom, do your duty

Like a wave gonna come, tsunami
Wanna take this ride, better hurry
'Cause me one, you there's a million
And they all wanna, huh, my Brazilian [laughter]


[Outro: Leigh-Anne Pinnock, All & with Perrie Edwards]
They say that it's overrated, well, they ain't doing it right (No)

[Intro: Static Major]
Haha, haha
Yeah, ayy (After dark)

[Chorus: Drake, Static Major & Both]
In the whip solo
No one's gotta know (After dark)
Knockin' at your door
I don't gotta work anymore (After dark)
You can
Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands (After dark)
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 1: Drake & Static Major]
Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'
Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (After dark)


[Chorus: Drake, Static Major, Ty Dolla $ign, Drake & Static]
In the whip solo, no one's gotta know
(No one's gotta know) after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more) after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night (Ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes


[Chorus: Drake, Static Major, Ty Dolla $ign, Drake & Static]
In the whip solo, no one's gotta know
(No one's gotta know) after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more) after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year it’s all business
It is a shame that a couple of ‘em are off limits
No offence to my nigga, it’s just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he ain't trippin’
I know I got a couple things that Lil’ Wayne dipped in
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Don’t let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I can’t let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it’s lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warhol’s for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like I’m driving into something
Bitches on the kid like I’m Iverson of something
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!


[Intro: Popcaan]
Yo, Unruly

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cinnamon, and your body is righteous
Tight as I want it
Tight as my lips when I lock them in silence
And your cellphone is ringin'
And you're worried 'bout somethin'
And you're walkin' outside on me now
Which side are you on again?
What room does he have you in?
What time do you leave again?
How long do we just stay friends?
What role do I play again?
I can't even make new friends
I'm here with no move again
I need to know how this ends

[Chorus: Popcaan & Drake]
That's all I need, and that's all I need
Weed and girl on me, that's all I need, ye-eah
Mhmm, that's all I need, and that's all I need
High grade weed and girl, that's all I need (Dem dead)

[Verse 2: Popcaan]

And yuh know the killy just ah pree when yuh breast swing

Roll up yuh tongue pon di ting slowly

Put down the iPhone, stop text

Only 'bout weed and sex
Gyal me concerned 'bout your tightness
Concerned 'bout your tightness
Yeah mi concerned 'bout your tightness
It tighter than a vice grip


[Outro: Popcaan]

High grade weed and girl, that's all I need
Dem dead?

High grade weed and girl, that's all I need

[Intro: Aziz Ansari]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do


[Verse 1: Drake & Bun B]
I said, "Tell me what's really goin' on"
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on


[Chorus: Drake]
You should come with me
If you got some time this is where you wanna be
We can go all night long
This can last all night
Bet it's goin' down, we gon make it right
This is what they mean when they talk about the life
We can go all night long
This can last all night
I'm with if you with it

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Tell them open up the doors, they gotta let us in
It's rap oldest rookie and it's youngest veteran
Go get us Sprite its for the drink, back together bitch
Mr. Doin' It doin' it, what could be better bitch
The dynamic duo, a two-man dream team
My pockets stay swollen, call me Mr. Cream Jean
Rocking white diamonds, that vanilla cream bling
They got the game locked down, call it sing sing
You cats straight down in Houston, me proper dos
In a corner booth chilling with some proper hoes
I hit Toronto girls, hold me for ransom
Til I let 'em buy me Polo or they throw me ransom
Damn son, it's like the best of both worlds
That's your wifey and your side, ya getting the best of both girls
So I'ma go ahead and leave the clock running
I ain't finna stop going, you ain't finna stop coming
When the head boy banging, it's like the Funky Drummer drumming
I go right to left and left to right, back to forth, it's nothing
This is something for the gangstas, something for the riders
With a pistol and the money and boppa right beside us
We highly flammable, you better not ignite us
You suffering from put one in the pussy nigga ride us
Goddamn we killing it, ya kids gon' have to hide us
So if you ain't coming with us then you gon' have to write us
Cause it's on


[Chorus: Drake]
You should come with me
If you got some time this is where you wanna be
We can go all night long
This can last all night
Bet it's goin' down, we gon make it right
This is what they mean when they talk about the life
We can go all night long
This can last all night
I'm with if you with it

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said "If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em"
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!


[Chorus: Drake]
You should come with me
If you got some time this is where you wanna be
We can go all night long
This can last all night
Bet it's goin' down, we gon make it right
This is what they mean when they talk about the life
We can go all night long
This can last all night
I'm with if you with it

[Intro: Choir]
All of the lights
Lights, lights
All of the lights

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Post-Chorus: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are (All of the lights)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights), lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life every night (All of the lights)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Them courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights), lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life every night (All of the lights)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get your own
Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get your own

[Verse 3: Fergie, Rihanna & Drake]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
'Kay, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

[Chorus: Choir]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Outro: Alicia Keys & Elton John]
Woah, woah
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say was oh)
Woah, woah
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say was oh)
Woah, woah
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say was oh)
Woah, woah
(I tried to tell you, but all I could say)


[Intro: Choir]
Lights, all of the lights

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this "give or take" world I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'mma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh
No lights but them infrared lights
Long knife, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life

[Chorus: Rihanna]
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights


[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ready, set, go, go, go, go, go
Go til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
"Westside bitch," quote, unquote
Woah there boy, don't go there ho
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named "Big" got bodied, huh?
But every rapper named "Sean" got money, ooh?
Well I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20 so I be counting a hundred 100's
Oh my Allah, Lordy lordy lordy, I took your chick
Now you want beef and I am chuckling like I'm Porky
Cause you spend all day with her spooning
I spend all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
They want these bullets to book it for me
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gonna book report me
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard, because bitch I'm an emergency

[Chorus: Rihanna & Choirs, Big Sean]
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby (B-I, Good, G)
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this (I do it)
Turn up the lights in here, baby (Boi, boi, bo)
You know what I need (Yeah)
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights (You know a nigga so good)


[Bridge: Alicia Keys, Big Sean, Elton John]
Whoa, whoa (So good, Westside, Lights)
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh (I'm so hood, I do it)
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 3: Drake]
Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding, Weezy with me
I just stepped out of the strip club, made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I ain't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some "me time"
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
I'm really about to go Spring Break now
And start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one, so call it a night, call it a night
And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that, all in the Sprite, all in the Sprite


[Interlude: Kid Cudi, Drake, Rihanna & Fergie]
Gettin' mine, baby (Yeah)
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah (Shout out my nigga Cudi too, that's my motherfuckin' nigga for real, man)
Gettin' right, babe (Shout out Cole)
You should go and get ya own (Think we got a buz now, nigga, fuck y'all niggas, man)
We're going all the way this time (I'm here!)

[Outro 1: Fergie, with Rihanna, Choirs]
We going all the way this time
Lights, lights
We going all the way this time (All of the Lights, all of the lights)
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time (All of the lights!)

[Hook: Rihanna]
All of the lights
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Outro 2: Rihanna, Charlie Wilson, Elton John, John Legend, Ryan Leslie, The-Dream, Tony Williams, Drake, Alicia Keys, Alvin Fields & Ken Lewis]

This another one from your boy V-O
I'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!

[Verse 1: Voyce]
Girl, I've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day
And I want to know, if You Feel The Same Way!!
Because I'm in and out of town, that's just how I got's to get down
But you understand, that's why I'm your man!!

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know

UH, UH, UH (You want me to drop to this beat?)
UH, UH, UH (HO!)
YEAH YEAH (Let me get a little gospel on them. Yeah. Uh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
They say he wanted the bounce back
I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't explain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!

[Bridge: Voyce]
Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!




I am grateful to be able to call America my second home. Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened, emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something.

It's impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues.

This is real and I'm concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends, and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step.

My thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence.

Be safe out there. More life.




[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club, I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two, my nig, 'bout to be twenty three, ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck

[Hook: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T-Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!

[Hook: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I just wanna thank God

All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health

And lettin' me ball on these niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]

Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'ma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill and (Jeremih)]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto, cause it's a lot of...

Yeah, its drizzy baby
Ah Ha uhh I’m ready, alright J fresh I got 'em

Look, I’m really the heir to the fortune of a millionaire
Talking money with me is really unfair
At the border like, "I swear, I have nothing to declare
I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year"
Even if you never met me you can tell I’m on the same shit
Loyal as a mother fucker nobody be saying shit
Dope boys know me cause I often speak they language
So well spoken man I should have went to Cambridge
Y-o-u-n-g ho, women they can be so
Motivated by money that’s why they be on me for
Ask your favorite rapper homie guarantee that he know
If he is the one I’m the zero, (pshh damn)
Please comprehend I am a Surf Club general
I’m Mr. consistent I have never come in intervals
You don’t want be caught in the middle like a center fold
I'm committing suicide if we're ever identical
Click clack pow how you like a nigga now?
In control of my domain
They can do what I allow
And I know Toronto miss me I'mma be home in a minute
That's my city and I run it you just run around in it
They see me out in person and say I ain't heard you sing yet
The world is my playground dont fuck with my swingset
We get the pitching then that's when it gets to piling
I'm calling your bluff don’t act like you can’t see me dialing
I'm in, low cut Louis with them hard denim jeans an a beige jacket
Hands down the best in my age bracket
Holla at me


[Intro: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

[Pre-Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Look at, look at, look at
Look at her butt

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Thi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...


[Pre-Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Yeah, I got a big fat ass (Ass, ass, ass, ass) (Kyuh!)
Come on!
Hey
Hey
Hey

An Evening I Will Not Forget :

When love was found
I kept my hope just like I'd hoped to
Then sang to the sea for feelings deep blue
And coming down
We've had problems that we've grown through
But I bet you dream of what you could do

At seventeen, I was alright
Was like nothing I could feel inside
And wishing you were here tonight
Is like holding on
But I still get to see your face, right?
And that's like nothing they can take, right?
So there won't be no feeling in the firelight
Hoping this will be right
Time to show your worth, child
I remember when her heart broke over stubborn shit
That's no way to be living kid
The angel of death is ruthless
And I'm always thinking summertime with the bikes out
Pushing our luck getting wiped out
Days with nothing but laughing loud
Underneath my coat won't you tap my shoulder, hold my hand
Nights with nothing but dark in there
You can be my armor then
Island smiles and cardigans
The nights that we've been drinking in
We're here to help you kill all of this hurt that you've been harboring
Confessions should be better planned
Alone, that night, I'm surely damned
Run away. I'll understand
What's important is this evening I will not forget
Purple, blue, orange, red
These colors of feeling, give me love, I'll put my heart in it
And I think about it all the time
The lights went out, you were fine
You kinda struggle not to shine
I still love you though
I still love you though
I still love you always
So hold me when I'm home, keep the evenings long
Crack and break and part ways
I still love you though
I still love you though
I still love you always
So hold me when I'm home, keep the evenings long
Let's not crack and break and part ways
And I wonder if I could let her down


Furthest Thing :

Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know, yeah

And I hate that you don't think I belong to you
Just too busy runnin' this to run home to you
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she were mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same


I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect

An Evening I Will Not Forget:

And I wonder if I could let her down
It's for real, it's for real
It's for real, it's for real



[Verse 1: Drake]
Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone, I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

[Chorus: Drake]
Come right in, set your bag down
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
I been waiting for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So, baby, I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone
'Cause I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top, so let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl, I'm gonna turn the lights off, but keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what we're about to do

[Chorus: Drake & Lloyd]
Come right in, set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

[Outro: Lloyd]
Oh, it's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio




J.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in "Jodeci Freestyle". I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J. Cole and I believe that it is the right, responsible, and respectful decision to remove the lyric from the song.

[Intro: Nickelus F]
Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day


[Verse 2: Drake]
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this"
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy



I swear to you Lord
Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between
*Back against the wall like a plasma screens*
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and e'ry night is New Year's
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin'
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And it's cool if you spill suttin it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colour only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin' today
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move, sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm giving away
You feel me?


[Intro]
Um, you know when I get my Aston Martin
I'll be in there, seats on recline, bad bitch in the passenger
Spliff burning with Matesa on, you feel me?
Lay back, just cruise

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele & Tory Lanez]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
(1 Verse Killah)
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all (Uh, Canada)
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Tory Lanez]
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go (yeah)
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing

[Verse]
Uh, everybody saying remember me
But where the hell is y'all memories?
I'm searching through walls of my membrane
It's insane, I'm entertainin' the big names
Through diamond, silver lining on my big frames
Niggas stressin' all I'm seeing through the Oakleys
Shit depressin', so we investing to blow trees
Had a dream I was chillin' in the OC
Then I landed out in Cali where they woke me
Discrete mumbles, from summer to street jungle
Voice from my uncle he tell me to keep humble
But at times I slip into deep wonder
Would they show they support in the event that my feet stumble?
See, when you already on, it's harder to say shit
Like the feelin' when you dazed and caught in amazement
Girls gotta stay separate from all of your statements
'Cause for the most part, hoes want a part of the payment
I'm relaxing in the Rolls Royce
Getting money 'cause I give these hoes no choice
I'm all alone in my box, blunt burnin' in the zone with my thots, wait


[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
Sometimes a nigga change for the money
Ladies that love me and all of these whips I roll
But buying all the dollars, so why would I holla?
Tryna put my pockets on swole
And I ain't got no time, no-no time (I ain't got no time)
I just got memories, oh no-no, yeah
(And I just got the memories, yeah)

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Tory Lanez]
(uh, Mr. Peterson, January 1st, 0-11)
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the...

Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take, wee


[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride

I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100


[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Interlude: Drake]
Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -

[Verse 3: Drake]
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

[Drake]
Are you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
The type of life you first timers could soak in
That virgin pussy's waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated, I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em', and keep em'
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heaven's our's
And you don't see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, that's a pensive look there
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
And yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged

Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch

I don't ever pay a percentage of the retail
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
You was having hoop dreams
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Young money old accounts
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts
Man, I don't even know my name anymore man (laughs)




[Verse 1]
She be jumping up and down
Trynna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour
Just to get that belt to fasten
All she wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Don't know where she going
But I do not plan on asking at all
Cause her spirit is free
And she, lets nobody else in except for me
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree
I’m the only one she loves
There’s no copies of the key
Homie, that’s a guarantee

[Verse 2]
Don’t forget that Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashin’
Other dudes would suffocate her, I don’t want her gaspin’
Don’t know where she’s going
And I do not plan on asking at all
I’ve never been the type, felt alike
My connection with niggas that wanna fight
Over women, that's not right
There's too many in the world
Homie, you can have your pick
But I swear that ones my girl
I swear that one’s my girl!




[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Zone, zone
Zone six!

[Chorus: Drake]
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm just an East Atlanta nigga with a body on his belt
I done had a million beefs but I ain't never call for help
I'll take a nigga bricks and I done took a nigga reup
Put that pistol on your partner made him piss all on himself
Got your bitch so pissy drunk
That she done threw up on herself
'Fore I send her back to you
She gon' have Guwop on her breath
I'm the last real nigga left
I'm on an island  by myself
I'm my only competition so I'm battling with myself
Facing prison, drug addiction
It's like I'm battling with myself
I done shook off all my demons
Now I'm back to myself
You didn't keep it real nigga so just keep it to yourself
Waiting on Gucci Mane to call you
Nigga better not hold your breath

[Chorus: Drake]
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
These niggas faking like they happy but they mad I'm home
I'm the 2K16 Al Capone
I slap a nigga with a strap and then I throw him a hundred
He be like "fuck going to trial, man just throw me the money"
Can't eat, can't sleep, man I miss these streets
Muhammad Ali and these streets miss me
I went from trappin' on the block to niggas trappin' for me
I left the trappin' went to rap thought you’d be happy for me
And then your jealousy turned to hate
And you wrote a statement on me
But when they let me out the gates
My bitch was waiting on me
See I ain't mad at you homie, we ain't got no beef
But I ain't got no rat for you, I know you must love cheese

[Chorus: Drake]
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back




[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

[Chorus]
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

[Chorus]
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)




Lyrics to Drake's song "Bad Breed" will be available when Views From The 6 is released on April 29th. Please continue to check Rap Genius for further updates!




[Verse 1: Slakah]
Lady, you say I stay in the house til four
We don't even go out no more
Its always the same eh
Always complainin
Its obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby
And people are shady

[Bridge: Drake]
My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at

[Hook: Drake]
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[Verse 2: Slakah]
Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next
Lend me ya kleenex
I'm tellin you baby
I think I'm a bout to cry
Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you
I hope that I see you again... again
Hope that I see you, see you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
Thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good


[Verse]
It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers
And me, I'm rolling with some brokers
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers are cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face, like, "No speak-a la ingles"
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me, I'm aware, and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives?
'Cause if you like it, y'all should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee
But I'ma try and have you on the trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point, I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays, rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here, baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they paid me
Mr. Bet You That's Expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it, girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that 'Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well, I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga, keep your two cents, I ain't tryna leave you broke


[Refrain]
Life of a don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds



[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, the blues is now kickin', and dinner is three Michelin
I don't eat red meat, but still got beef sizzlin'
Know that I need discipline
I keep singin' for all these hoes, they keep listenin'
Niggas love to bro up with the boy and dap fists-es
But we are not equivalent, dawg
I been an only child, don't need siblings
And I'm past them like the times that he's livin' in, okay
Man, if you saw what I flew here, you'd be like, "He's sickenin'"
If you not runnin' some top, we not gon' keep kickin' it

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
No Ceilings 3
Lil Wayne and Drake, let's go

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, the blues is now kickin' and dinner is three Michelin
I don't еat red meat, but still got beef sizzlin'
Know that I need discipline
I keep singin' for all thеse hoes, they keep listenin'
Niggas love to bro up with the boy and dap fists-es
But we are not equivalent, dawg
I been an only child, don't need siblings
And I'm past them like the times that he's livin' in, okay
Man, if you saw what I flew here, you'd be like, "He's sickenin'"
If you not runnin' some top, we not gon' keep kickin' it
Classics, I keep scribblin', lights in the Universal building just keep flickerin'
Money just keep comin' in, you would think I'm Irish the way that it stays doublin'
I could feed a country with the tax that I pay governments
Whatever they're doin' with my cash is very troublin'
Okay, February came around, I used to get paid shovelin'
Sold clothes, walked dogs, trust me, I stay hustlin'
When it came to school, there's no way that I'm A-plus-in' it
So I just dropped out of it, trust me, I'm not proud of it
Niggas get too comfy in they spot, they get knocked out of it
Niggas get a gun just so they can make props out of it
Shawty make a scene in the house, she get locked out of it
Yeah, you not 'bout to be chillin' in this bitch with kicked feet up
I'ma make you bounce out this ho like Big Freedia
Pete O. used to throw a purple tint on a two-liter
First private plane I ever rode was a eight-seater
Before that, I got the bedroom hot with a space heater
On top of that, I didn't have shit to my name either, that's real
But now I'm givin' house tours 'til it's back to world tours
Play that "Mask Off" when they find the real cure
I might not be good for her, but I'm real to her
Got no time for her, but give Richard Mille to her
That's the only way I know how to express love
My dawgs love sticks and drums like they Questlove
All them jokes about Aubrey, they got me messed up, for real
I come with a lot of complications inside me
It's always people misleadin' me that are tryna guide me
Everyone wants to try me, but no one wants to buy me
Everyone wants to meet me, but no one wants to keep me
Everyone talkin' lemons when everything is peachy
Everyone got they hands out, and it ain't to reach me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Mhm, yeah, mhm
Everyone got they glass out, let's drink to Weezy
Every nigga that stare me down just came to see me
Choppin' up a lil' cash cow, that's steak I'm eatin'
Check deposits, high-risers with extra closets
The sex platonic, I talk intelligent, text Ebonics
The electronic guitars whinin', that's just Nirvana
Tommy gun on the counter, I call it Mr. Thomas
That'll keep niggas honest
I'm dozin' off in the driver seat 'cause the seat give massages
Decimal point money, these numbers too steep for commas
I'm eye to eye with niggas, I can't help but to see beyond 'em
Got a two-seater problem
Niggas thinkin' they cold, I knock the flu-season out 'em
Bitches forget they hoes, and that's when Tunechi remind 'em
I used to fuck Gucci models, I'm fuckin' Gucci designers
I keep it too G regardless, I'm gettin' too deep for divers
Let me resurface, I'm flexin' on purpose
She especially curvy, bet she be servin' every purpose, perfect
I'm better than perfect, I'm sick, I need to see a medical person
Eatin' all of these rappers with these edible verses
All I gotta be is all that I can possibly
She really, really into me, then suck it all up out of me
I'm proud of me, I don't know how to be sorry, apologies
You fuckin' with my math, you better know some trigonometry
'Cause I'ma be bustin', leave your lima bean at your mama feet
I flip the economy like Dominique Dawes
They say I'm trippin', I guess they wishin' I finally fall
I don't need war, I need a bitch that know I'ma need yours
I'ma need more, niggas is shifty like Honda Accords
Fire alarm, ain't got no ceilings, we climbin' the walls
Higher than yours, I fuck your bitch and she die in my arms
Lion has roared, No Ceilings 3 with my mind on the fourth
Holla at your boy

[DJ Drop: DJ Khaled]
This that B.B. King, Lil Wayne featuring Drake
Classic shit (DJ Khaled)
No Ceilings 3, Lil Wayne!


You can't love, but I bet ya
Yo can't hine yeah

[Verse 1]
Here we Gooo
The 1st time around
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhyme-in Now
I'm seeing it clearer, the season is nearer
And still I must change, I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm out spoken still
They not sure it'll work but their all hoping
He'll emerge the victim, my words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that you heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin' before ya'll
I barely get tired, I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week is What I'm daily required
I'm meetin' quotas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova
Be in the throne instead of being ya own
But look

[Hook:]
Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin' on the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go


[Verse 2:]
It's like I'm makin' moves in my city though
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin' to get with me though
Important and vital
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not
Play me
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin' the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh

[Verse 3:]
Look... I got few days left
And I'm a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We handin' fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin' up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up
Holla!

[Refrain: Lloyd]
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Young Money)
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl (Kane is in the building, nigga)
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag


[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right
He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, "Nicki don't stop, you the bestest"
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

[Verse 4: Drake]
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, "Shake'n Bake" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her


[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

[Refrain: Lloyd]
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

[Verse 5: Tyga]
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: "Don't you ever show this!"
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said "Your words get me open"
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment


[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock (Young Money, Yea , Yea)

I wanna ride you out for Yokahama
Your body baby
Is shaped like my guitar
I wanna tune it up and play it all night
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Cause she wanna Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh do baby

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
She got that good good
She Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, For her attractive ass
And now we murderers, Because we kill time
I knock her lights out, And she still shines
I hate to see her go, But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day, hot as a summers eve
Young Money thieves, steal your heart with ease


[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flinstone I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock girl

I-I-I can make your bedrock

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
In the bed girl me be trouble
I can make your body rock me no rubble
So holla back when you see me you heard I tear that pussy up me and young jeezy it's gettin late
We can see the sun come over to my house & play on my drums brum bum bum bum give the drummer some girl here the drummer come

[Verse 4: Drake]
I Love Ya Sushi Rolls, Hotter Than Wasabi
I'm Race'n For Your Love
Shake And Bake Ricky Bobby
I'm At The W, But I Can't Meet You In The Lobby
Girl I Gotta Watch My Back, Cause I'm Not Just Anybody
I Seen Em' Stand In Line, Just To Get Beside Her
I Let Her See The Aston, And Let The Rest Surprise Her
That's When We Disappear, You Need GPS To Find Her
Oh That Was Your Girl?
I Thought I Recognized Her


[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the G-spot

[Outro: Lloyd]

[Intro]
Yeah, look

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 1]
Stay in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust


[Interlude]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

[Verse 2]
Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck 'bout jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that



[Intro]
Yeah, Link Up TV, Behind Barz
Big up man like Rashid, Joey, Tadas, yeah
Shoutout Giggs for settin' the ting

Mm-hmm, yeah, look

[Chorus]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe

[Produced by Boi-1da and Vinylz]

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah


[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'


[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that


[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

[Outro: Drake]
Rip rip, nigga

[Verse 1]
Shit's all good
The deal got signed
And my split's all good
And these haters pretending
That it's all good
Say that shit in person
Man I wish ya'll would
I'm a mothafucking genius goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you
I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat
If you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket
And these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chilling in the cut, nigga what
And I'm feeling like


[Refrain]
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie

[Belly]
Here I go
Street report
Balling over here
We need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house look something like a resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
When this money run slower than Eyore
If your life is a movie you an extra
I'm so fly, I glide Clyde Drexler
Mr. Pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now
Fuck next up


[Refrain]
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie



[Verse 1]
Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda coulda wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin’ my time
'Cause she heard it all
'Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But she heard it all
Well, I'ma say it anyway shawty

[Refrain]
I’m from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You ain’t gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I’m just tryna say
I’m from the city, oh
Where the money makes a difference
But it never made us different, oh


[Intro]
You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause


[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it

When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying


[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it

You're the best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had

[Verse 2: Do I Wanna Know]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get the feeling you can't shift the type
That sticks around like something in your teeth?
There some aces up your sleeve
You've no idea that you're in deep
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep

[Chorus: Best I Ever Had]
'Cause baby you're the best, baby you're the best, baby you're the best
You're the best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had
Baby you're the best, baby you're the best, baby you're the best
You're the best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had

[Bridge: Sunlight On Your Skin]
So go, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Things don't feel the same when I'm out of town
So go, let's watch the rain as it's falling down

[Chorus: Best I Ever Had]
'Cause baby you're the best, baby you're the best, baby you're the best
You're the best I ever had, you're the best I ever had
Baby you're the best, baby you're the best, baby you're the best
You're the best I ever had, you're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had

Ha! And you ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chilling with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm working, I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one to never get confused with, 'cause...


[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

[Chorus: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
I say you the fucking...

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, you the only one that see the real Nicki
I can show you "Chill Nicki" 'cause of how you deal wit me
When they knock my blocks down
You come and you build with me
Even though you real busy, you still fuckin' real Drizzy
It's so amazing
I figured out this world is ours with the taking
I figured out that when I go out and all those people scream
That's some of them are living vicariously through me
That's why I put that "S" on my chest and I'm gone
But on another note, let's have sex in my dorm
And I'ma make you beg, 'cause you look pretty when you beggin'
So meet me on the campus, I'll be there around eleven
So let me put my books down (Down)
Excuse me if I look down (Down)
Guess I'm a little nervous, but I'm at your service
Look at what you took down (Down)


[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything, other niggas never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
That's why I hold you down, every time you hit me up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
I make you beg for it, until I give it up
You say the same thing, every single time

[Chorus: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
I say you the fucking...

[Verse 3: Drake]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee, 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double-cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix? Then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back, and make your fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots
I'm saying!


[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

[Chorus: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)

[Outro: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
Ugh! Aww, yeah! (Aww, yeah)
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
(This is...)
Just make sure they that special somebody (An essay)
Young Money! (...Baby!)
Yeah, yeah



[Verse 1: Drake]

Okay I just got back from another label meeting and
I ain't what they looking for I ain't what they looking for
I ain't really Atlanta I ain't really Brooklyn or
I dont fit the appeal for them shows that they could book him for
Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall
I'm famous so I get approached fast, Louie and Coach bags
All up in coach class, gem like Topaz, cool like slow Jazz
Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass
I promise this is me, me

[Hook: Drake & Slakah The Beatchild]

I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you

[Bridge: Slakah The Beatchild]

You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2: Drake]

Yea
Ok, I'm floating in my zone without a scheduled descend
The rising and the fall was never my intent
I want this shit forever printed in cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
I'm only tryin to win I ain't tryna present
You gotta listen close like it's coming through the vent
These rappers can't see me I live behind the tint
And just to get a visual them niggas gotta squint
There I ammmm
Little me in row 23F real reconize real is there none of yall left?
Everybody in the game can't none of yall ref?
And filter out the bullshit the fuck is yall def?
You'r now tuned in to the new comer of this summer
The Chris Paul of this fall exist yall - Yea
And is the realist nigga still I?!
A bitch could love you to death and you still die
Ahhh!

[Hook: Drake & Slakah The Beatchild]

I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit is wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
I'ma tell you, I'ma tell you this right now
If you, if you woke up this mornin', nigga you winnin' for real
(Buddah Bless this beat)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I got a big amount, I took a different route
I am the pick of the litter
I was in juvy, they gave me community
I had to pick up some litter
I want it easy, please do not tease me
I wore my Yeezys to dinner
This is the season, I got the seasonin'
Don't make me sprinkle you niggas
I got my reasons, you wanna please me
Send me the pussy, not pictures
Met her this week and fucked her this evenin'
She turn a freak on the liquor
Yeah, I am a boss on these bitches
Yeah, I pour some Voss on these bitches
Yeah, I have no thoughts on these bitches
Yeah, rock double-cross on these bitches, yeah
Dearly departed, gather today
On some Prince shit
You know what they say
Me and my safe, got a friendship
Ten on me, thin weight, flip weight, gettin' paid
Gettin' laid
Bitch made, took off sick days
6 trey, 6-4 bounce, bitch, bounce
Hood nigga, favorite spot was the Waffle House
Patty melt with the hash browns
Tryna avoid all the pat-downs
Tryna avoid all the lame hoes
Weirdos in the background
Blackout when I back out
Blow the horn for a pedestrian
Shawty ride like an equestrian
I bought the dress that she in
Red bottoms in his and hers
Got a Rollie in his and hers
Got a car in his and hers
Walk in the zoo and say, "Pick a fur"
Last night was a blur to me
This mornin' I got two with me
I don't know what to do with me
Goin' ape like the zoo with me
Got a tool with the screw missin'
Two girls in the pool kissin'
Everywhere I go, the rod with me
'Cause these niggas actin' too fishy

[Interlude: Drake]
Fuck y'all niggas on, man?
Duffle bag forever
Just left V Live
Atlanta could never die as long as Tit alive
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I got a big amount
I think I'm the biggest out
Got hits and I ain't even put 'em out
Lit and you can't even put it out
Got the Billboard melodies
Rap is somethin' I do on the side
Crossed over to the other side
And I didn't even have to die
Got the money and I never show it
Let a nigga try to play heroic
Michael Jackson talkin' to me in my dreams
And he say, "You bad and you know it"
Better shamone with my check then
I'm a J. Prince investment
Niggas love to talk reckless
Then see me like best friends
Got the sand-colored FN
And I've never seen the inside of a Marriott or a Westin
Five stars, nothin' less than
Fuck niggas on your payroll
And you let 'em know the safe code
And you knew him for a month though
But you call them niggas big bro
You could move in the Hidden Hills
And we still don't live by the same code
I'm respected everywhere I go
Nigga, long live Bankroll
Skip the rainbow, funny style shit
And it's straight to the pot of gold
Somebody, everybody know
6 God with the god flow
Yeah, yeah


Big bank fr

[Verse 1: Drake]
Wisdom tooth, got Perc' in my system
I've been buyin' Birkins in rhythm
Save 'em for my wife when I get her
Right now, not the season for givin'
Bossin' up the city, that's a big mood
Niggas we don't even fuck with gettin' Ms too
But just know we could cut that off again too
Sparkle up the wrist, now that's a big mood

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, things going my way, big mood
Exotic up the driveway, big mood
Double up the contract, big mood
If we don't have no contact, then we ain't cool
Had to hit up Jimmy, hit up Mike and tell 'em double
Triple, double, Chubbs is hoodied up, I feel like Russell
Baka, he a star, but still around to burst a bubble
Bitch, you crazy, don't pull up at 3 AM to cuddle

[Verse 2: Drake]
'Member when I used to go to clubs and pay the cover
Bitch, this not Fugazi, but my neck still changin' color
You haven't found another 'cause there ain't another
I break down a hunnid bag and give it to my cousin, ayy
Cashville, I got bands still like a boss
All they do is PR double-E me like I'm Dolph
They say "holy" when they see the chain, that's not a cross
Put the owl on it, you can never take it off


[Verse 3: Future]
Wisdom tooth, I'm pimpin' like Goldie
Brand new Phantom cost me ten Rollies
I've been buyin' rings like I'm Kobe (Pluto!)
Fuck Trump, that's for my woadies (Gang, gang)
Bossin' up the gang, that's a big mood
Niggas we don't fuck with get them bags too
I think you should know you can get whacked too
Pinky ring splash like a swimmin' pool
King Pluto, might as well nail me to the cross
All I do is run my bands up like I don't walk
I get Boosie in the Lamborghini, wipe me off
Cashville, I got racks still, fuck the law
Presidential suite filled with Birkin
Wisdom tooth got Mollies and Perkies
Fuckin' with my gang and get murdered
Shout out to my city, they murder
All-All I did was boss up the city, that's my fault
You not touched a hunnid Ms, I don't wanna talk
Shut yo mouth, you talkin' too basic
We put yo BM in rotation
Shit, niggas woulda did the same thing if it was me
King Pluto, I gave all my exes to the streets
King Pluto, I got pink diamonds on my teeth
Pink weddin' ring on my pinkie too
I got slimes with me, they got sticks too
I got nine bitches, I got fifty coupes
I got nine main bitches, I got fifty coupes
They say "holy" when they see my chain, it's not a cross


[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, things going my way, big mood
Exotic up the driveway, big mood
Double up the contract, big mood
If we don't have no contact, then we ain't cool
Had to hit up Jimmy, hit up Mike and tell 'em double
Triple, double, Chubbs is hoodied up, I feel like Russell
Baka, he a star, but still around to burst a bubble
Bitch, you crazy, don't pull up at 3 AM to cuddle

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
I know we just signed a deal, but
I need my advance on the next one too, they know I'ma be around
Yeah

(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

[Chorus: Drake]
'Cause I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team

They need some really big rings
They need some really nice things

[Verse 1: Drake]
Man, what a time to be alive
You and yours vs. me and mine
Oh, we talkin' teams? Oh, we talkin' teams?
Oh, you switchin' sides? Wanna come with me?
Look at the smile on me, look at the owl on me
I do not chase girls, but they run a mile for me
Say she gon' ride for me, I'll buy the tires for you
This game is different, you only get one shot when niggas go foul on you
Man, fuck 'em all, man, we want it all
Don't get too involved, we gon' knock ya off
And to top it off, I'm with all the dawgs
It's a new season and we still breathin'

[Chorus: Drake]
And I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things

I got a really big team
They need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team


[Verse 2: Future]
Man, what a time to be alive
I'm drinkin' lean, they thought I died
I run with kidnappers, I'm talkin' 'bout kidnappers
I'm talkin' 'bout murderin' niggas, I'm talkin' 'bout carjackers
You just a battle rapper, I'm an official trapper
Niggas be droppin' subliminals, nigga, they just some jibber-jabber
We take a Mello Yello, then we fill it with red forever-ever
These niggas so jealous, jealous
Man, these niggas get scared, they tellin', tellin'
I fuck a check up on everything
I bought some ice when the feds came
I bought that bitch new Celine, I got rings, I got racks like Serena
All of my rings Aquafina, my bitch Aquafina
Pluto and Jupiter, I go to Venus
I'm fresh out the store, but I'm not out the cleaners
Who keepin' score? 'Cause these niggas, they losin'

[Chorus: Drake]
'Cause I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team
I got a really big team
They need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yeah
(Gotta be something wrong with you baby)
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up

Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama (Damn)

Hey!
Hahaha
You crazy man for real
Ho!
Oh well nigga fall back ho!
Goddamn
I said it without sayin' it man

I know everyone is enjoying the circus but I want to clarify this image in question. This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This picture is from 2007, a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best Friend at the time Mazin Elsadig who is also an Actor from Sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry, and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed much

[Verse 1: JD Era]
Look nigga I can murder anything
Retro, techno, electro, slow flow, fast flow
Hottest in the metro
I spit hurricanes
Copy that like an echo
On my Flo-Rida shit tell'in everyone to get low
Respect me or die thats the stance that I'm taking
A prince but a story is a legend in the making
Cause few niggas spit it with the temperature of Satan
On my Betty Crocker shit you can say a nigga caking, waiting
Summer opportunity escaping
Right through the cracks of a sticky situation
My balls reach stars tell these niggas who they facing
Who the fuck I gotta battle
Four or five mic rating
The upper echelon
Top of the totem you looking at the best
Tell these magazine to quote em
This next bars for haters you still don't know em
I dont got enough room
So get the fuck off my scrotum
Go for the gusto
Built for the hustle
Mixtape murderer still don't gotta adjust though
Tryna be a mogul like Jay, Puff, or Russell
The floor has warm machines made for Hercules muscle
Nervous, you should be
Born where the hood be
Good be a legend
Baby girl I could be
You can be
Find the exit once you find your panties
It's Black market ATF
Who fucking who with the family, nigga


[Verse 2: Drake]
Know more, ask less
All verses get dummied like crash tests
I say your favorite rappers subpar at best
These whack niggas couldn't find me with an address
Yes, guess who's back at it
Stage an intervention, it's apparent I'm an addict
Balling isn't my hobby it's more like a habit
These niggas acting like every day is the Sabbath
My life move faster then a leopard sprint
Round the world got a lot of spots like leopard print
And I'm fresh like peppermint
Always claim Toronto most of them are scared to represent
Cause success we've never had it
Many came close but never managed to grab it
It must be an omen
The curse so tragic
Til they give me a Grammy
Then poof, black magic



(Intro)

I want cock
Peepee, i want peepee peepee

[Intro]
Unruly, unruly, maddas
Who keeps bringing more? I've had too many
This Virginia done me off already
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Chorus]
Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Verse 1]
'Cause I know what I like
I know how I wanna live my life
I don't need no advice
You're not here and we both know why
So, move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I'm buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, I'll go crazy

[Chorus]
Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Verse 2]
I know we can't keep it together forever
'Cause you're crazy sometimes
And I only see you sometimes
Move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I'm buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, I'll go—, look just

[Chorus]
Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Lionel Richie]
Together forever
Good morning, good afternoon, good night!
I'm here to talk about More Life
One second


[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... up)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God


[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man


[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I


[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed

Some niggas bitter with life and they hate me
They wanna put knife in my ribs, whoa

I told her I'd pray for the kid


[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Future]

[Verse 1]
Why are we in Chanel talkin' 'bout life and shit?
Got my emotions on open mic and shit
Fancy, all this pink champagne on ice and shit
Off one glass, girl, I can see how nice you get

[Chorus]
Buzzin' your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me

[Verse 2]
I know, you know, I'm in too deep to let it go
I know, you know, it’s in my nature to get distant
I know it's been a year since I left you alone
Unfortunate, I think you know there's somethin' missin'
But you never say shit, don't know how to take it
We're good on our own, but
I miss being on Wiltshire at your place, and
I drink you under tables, got you misbehavin'

[Chorus]
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me



Who else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
Treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
I'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose
I don't get shit confused
I'm not with different crews
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes
We live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Tell me today's weather
I know they say they good but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If there's a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby, what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he's a hater baby he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lyin' to the kids, like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Mary's
But I ain't playin' high school games
Pulling McClarens through a McDonald's drive through lane
I'm too fly, keep it hip-hop like Afu Ra
Girl on that McClaren, you gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I don't usually do this, but the drink has got me moody
Got me thinking 'bout decisions, man, I shoulda left with Juve
Got me busting with my cutie, I can't trust her nor her booty
Every night, she acting new-school, I am not gon' be a student
I got class, I got trash, I got bills, I got pills
Heard them boys gon' write me off, I hope they also writing they wills
I got beam, I got flash, I got dreams and nightmares past
I'm allergic to the *brrrr*, I'm using wings to wipe my ass
Right now, I'm high as shit, I'm on the Bumbu, straight
I just got out my bitch, felt like the Sunken Place
She give me drunken face, she give me highest praise
And when I'm in LA, I'm smoking Kobe Bryant eighths
I watched my father whip the yay up like some mayonnaise
Moms would come home, they would argue, he didn't put away the plates
Taught me how to do my dirt and clean up at the same time
Right now, I'm on a couple percs and leaning at the same time
Remix, baby! Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high

Uh, okay, started, yeah, uh

Verse 1:
I started from the bottom now I'm here
They called me in for the lead ain't you supposed to cheer?
They go "if you ain't poppin' D I'm about to veer"
Positive the tires ain't rockin' it so I'mma just steer clear
Of the hating, non-appreciating
Bump getting faded, I ain't made it
Feelin' jaded for these cowards turn and face it
Spacing out, never in, why the hell you so complacent?
I'm just tracin back, riddle that
Tic tac, paddy whack
Her and I, same direction
Are we parallel or adjacent?
You just tell me "Well, depends on the pavement."
What is that, the paver's shaking?
Sir you are not mistaken
Yet it's your asphalt that she's pacing
That cristal, going raw you know without any contraceptive
Flesh pressing, undressing, you know that dirty method
In and out, no doubts you'll be bustin' any second
That nut don't add up to 18 years just for the record
Nah, heh, don't get to stepping
Yeah, right there just check it
It's positive, your prerogative was to chill and just wreck it
Now try and be a good father, acknowledge her otherwise
Cause leaving her hanging ain't sending too good of a message
Not messin, just pressin' records
Checkin if her tum hurts
Giving her medicine, yet again, what's worse?
A text message saying "Baby, this ain't gonna work"?
Or legging it whilst pregnant tryna to make it to work?
She a municipal clerk, yeah you straight menacing jerk
You weren't complaining, raining money on her when you was watching her twerk
She paining while you gaining, put in the work
Or she'll do it by herself, no help
She a Maverick, I call her Dirk

(Drake - Started From The Bottom Hook)


[Verse 1]
This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask


[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
Late, late, late, late

[Bridge]
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Show me if this is brand new (Brand new)
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
New, new, new (Brand new), oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Drake)
This here is on some truthful shit
Its seems like everything I do your use to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with!
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damned
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new

(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(Aye Aye Aye)

(Drake verse 2)
This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I can't even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?


(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new girl
(Aye Aye Aye)

(Lil Wayne)
This here on some remix shit
Seems like ever thing I do they leakin it
And I hate hearing stories of who im sleeping with
I swear I got to hide what I got in my ride
So she still think im confident and damn
How long will this last
My life is on the pedestal, am I moving to fast?
Feel like im in crazy competition with my past
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything im doing brand new

(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(aye,aye,aye)

(Lil Wayne)
Remix baby if he can do good then I can do better
Dont blame me if any man would if he knew better(um huh)and dont won't to here about him anymore
But I know you heared this song before..


(Drake)
Is anything I'm doing brand new(6x)
Is everything I'm doing too late(6x)

Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed
On the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late?

(chorus w/Drake)
Is anything im doing brand new?
Brand new brand new
Show me if this is brand new, new
Ooh ohh yeah yeah yeah

(Lil Wayne)
And this is the remix baby weezy baby,drizzy, yung mula baby

All alone when I am gone

Yes, I'll be there, yeah, yes, I'll be there
'Cause when I'm all alone, I think about your face

Promise that I won't forget

Yes, I'll be there, oh, yes, I'll be there, oh
About to board a flight, sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you but I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh

[Chorus]
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me
(Check it out, check it out)
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me, fly

All of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces, but there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the GOAT and talk about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga


*Lyrics from Snippets*

[Verse: Drake]
...the offer you give me was preposterous
Papi, this bird won't fly, you sold me an ostrich
I'm just another nigga tryna keep his money up
I'll wipe that smirk off your face, you think it's funny, huh?

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't playin' my nigga, go ahead and giggle
But bullets don't tickle
If you think you playin' with Elmo, hell no

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
If you was in a pine box (Box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in an-and fall asleep (I fall asleep)
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me ('Cause you are)
If you was in a pine box (Box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep (I fall asleep)
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me
'Cause you are, the-the death of me, you-you, the death of me

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar, women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all
'Cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as… myself
And it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you're outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died


[Intro (Throughout): Alicia Keys]
You should say it right now

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?


[Chorus: Meek Mill & Nicki Minaj]
Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited


[Chorus: Meek Mill & Nicki Minaj]
Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Its a heart for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's crying
Its trust for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's lying

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, hey, hey, come on
We're having too much fun right here

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
She's got a secret, but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low
'Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it into something major

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timabaland)]
It's a cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more


[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Fantasy play the role
And all these new moves that I'd like got me feeling like a stranger
Say my name, do you know
'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we are laying in the Manger

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timabaland)]
It's a cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

[Verse 3: Drake]
Okay, this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long 'til you get off from work, but listen
I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya, girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know, I’ll keep a secret for ya


[Bridge: Drake]
I'm tryna ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in

[Verse 4: Drake]
Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, or it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timabaland)]
It's a cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

On the hood you see the Stallion, passenger a stallion
Niggas gettin' nervous, I'm passin' out the Valium
I suggest you pop it, but please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin' up in 400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes'll see me, be like that's how you feelin'?
Used to stay up at The Twelve, now you're worth like 12 million
Boy, you did it, boy, you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fuckin' women that knew Biggie, so it really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO, and Freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I'm Tony in my city, huh

[Chorus: French Montana]

Call me Montana (Yeah), Frenchy Montana (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on the low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before

[Hook]
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)

[Verse 2]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it -- all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next ting, YMCMB (ah)

[Bridge]
Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight I’ll ease your mind
That’s why I’m calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It’s hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you

[Hook]
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)

[Verse 3]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, like the new king with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)

[Bridge]
Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight I’ll ease your mind
That’s why I’m calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It’s hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you

[Outro]
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)

Just mail me my ring back, can't keep that shit.




[Intro: Drake & Beyoncé]
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Yeah, can I, baby? Can I, baby?

[Verse: Drake & Beyoncé]
Can I bring you to the six where I really stay, baby?
Show you why I am the way I am
Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, baby?
'Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
Can I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?
You do so much more than that for me
Can I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?
'Cause that's the side you never get to see
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be

[Outro: Drake & Beyoncé]
Can I, baby? Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Can I? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Before I turn the lights out

And yeah I got a deal now and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so excitin' I get bored with it
I'm the best one outta my peers
And everybody pray I'm runnin' outta ideas
Pass my Moselys it's all so bright
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures man the flow is a collage
Critics have a hard time pointin' out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky through the roof of your garage

Ever since I was a child, I just wanted to be a star
Before I died, make it to the top of this [?]
I heard the sky is the limit, so I'm gon fly
Step on the diving board [?]
Look boy I'm a man and I'm grown

My fame [?] that mean it's perfect timing
Got a team called Young Money, and the coach called Weezy timeless

And we making money, the money don't make us
Cause the money changed niggas, don't break us
YM OB, till I'm gone, nigga
Young Money on tour, but I'm still at home, nigga
Purple spright poured in my stirophoame cup
Mama praying for me, hoping that I slow up
But I proceed to act an animal
What comes up, goes down like a cannonball
I'm just tryna reach my peek, nigga feel me
And lord knows most of the shit I love [?]
But I'll proceed to keep going until I'm filthy
Cause one of my niggas just faced the judge and found guilty
So Imma spread my wings, and Imma keep flying
And hope I don't freefall and dive in

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy but I'm still the man, come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands, then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17

[Chorus: Drake]
Want a lot, can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything

[Verse 2: Drake]
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

[Chorus: Drake]
Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything

[Verse 3: Drake]
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, "Are we straight?"
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face, watch with the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area

[Outro: Sandi Graham]
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.




[Intro]
Uh, yeah man, uh
I feel real good right about now
I feel like im, im making a return
I ain't even been gone yet I ain't even
Taken a leave of absence but I feel like I'm back
Yeah man

[Verse]

Check, I roll with the coalition, when no one listened
I spoke out now niggas is throwing this in
You gassed up, my vehicle low emission
I can enter your field trip with no permission
Slip, i've done it before told ya I run it before
Now the city is mine, and what you thought it would be
Ain't a rapper working harder than me I put my heart in T
Uh, ?, carry the city on my back like a Jansport
Or even in a victor bag, so if you quick to brag then u get clipped to tag
Homie, u make a lot of music niggas ain't feeling
You rappers shouldn't rap, you rappers should paint ceilings
That's why I ain't competitive y'all, cuz deep down I know im much better than y'all
Watchu mean do I actually flow, wanna know if I actually flow just ask V-O
Im tryna make the wrist on my cousin ashley glow till she waken up by someone and it actually snow
Stop snitching if your man seen a killer, you never ever seen it, it can't seem familiar
We keep it on and poppin like the dance scene in Thriller
This the new version fresh prince and andreana miller
And d-10tion the boi-1da
And people focused on keeping the boy under
Probably cuz I don't act like y'all
And I ain't gotta sell crack like y'all
Well not really, I mean I do move crack in a disc form
But thats only because I don't rap like y'all
And now its occurring to them
Its starting to be my friend is reassuring to them
Either that or every verse im referring to them
So catch me in a zone till they leave me alone
Uh, yea, and its down south for the summer ima leave them at home

[Outro]
Uh, and thats just what it is
Uh, everybody that mess with me I see you
You feel me
Benard I see ya homie
Precise I see ya
Ransom, brandon I see ya
Uh, niko I see ya uh
Yea richie sosa I see ya uh

That's how I do it holla at me
And thats it


[Intro]
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Ayy

[Verse 1]
UberX to Hidden Hills
Give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills
Then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road
You could hit it with a stone
I be out here on my own
I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town
'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

[Chorus]
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke


[Interlude]
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm– I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

[Chorus]
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke



[Verse 1]
All night I've, been staring, can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know

[Chorus]
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

[Verse 2]
I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy

[Chorus]
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

[Outro]
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night

How'd I do? How'd I do?
Baby tell me how you feel
They say real girls ain't never perfect
Perfect girls ain't real
I'd agree but I guess we'll just wait and see
'Cause I swear you act like perfect is the only way to be
N-N-Nothing matters 'cept for you
Don't let no one out here blind you
Don't remember why you love me
Please allow me to remind you
And I know you left me once
But I came right back to find you
Even though I like being in your past
You got a bright future behind you
Oh, damn, oh
Girl I must admit I look amazing next to you
Girl you crazy, sexy, cool
And you stayed obsessed with school
But that's good
Cause you know that them grades impress me too
And my free days are just for you
But I don't get many
It's like every time we spend time
It feels like the first time
'Cause we never spend enough time
You catch me at the worst time
It ain't like you're not worth time
Just I don't control it
But tonight I made it happen, just to celebrate the moment
Give it up one time

[Bridge: Tank]
Ohhhhhhh

Five, four, three, two, one

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
And I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Boy, you got me down, and got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started gettin' dressed and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some dudes I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
And I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing
(Two one four, witness!)

[Verse 2]
Some people just said let it go
And on and on and such and such
But they don't ride around with us
No, no, no
Ain't that too bad we love to hang
And for a while, it stays the same
But now you tryna change the game
No, no, no


[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
And I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing

Late night when you need my love
Late night when you need my love
Late night when you need my love

You've reached the Erykah Badu hotline
If you're calling for Erykah, press 1
If you're calling to wish her a happy birthday, Kwanzaa, MLK, Black History Month, Juneteenth, or Hanukkah, press 2
If you're calling because you just saw her on B.E.T, MTV, or any other social media outlet, and you're checking to make sure you're still in good standing, press 3
If you're calling to beg for some shit in general, press 4
If you're calling to beg for some shit, but this is that pre-call before the actual begging, press 5
If you've already made that pre-call and this is the actual call to beg, press 6
If you're calling to ask for some free tickets in a city near you, and know she don't really fuck with you like that? Press 7
If you're calling to book Erykah, to flip the first burger at your company BBQ, or to DJ at your little cousins slip-and-slide party, press 8
If you're calling to say peace, and don't really fit into any of those descriptions
Text me, because I don't really answer voicemail

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
You used to call me on my cellular device at night
And I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing

Pound cake, cheesecake, I love cake
You like cake too?
Cake with the money, cake with the clowns when it’s funny
Uh, check this, yo, yo

Verse 1:

I’m beating on my chest like a primate
I’m Up in the clouds cause my climb ate
That CO2, O2 diatomic
I’m doing more than spitting yeah I’m trying to vomit
That was a little bit of a stretch
Least I will admit it so don't you think of me any less
Tired of people taking these shots they all suppressed
If you can walk in these 16’s please be my guest
Yes, I’m just being honest, Tea
Made with brewed leaves, honey, cane sugar and filtered water
I’m glad to be apart of
This organization My thoughts racing so I had to put it on paper
My handwriting is more erratic than a damned pilot
On E, percosets doing exotics
Chill homie I’m vibing
This a no topic, free zone, no cops
V-Vrooom
Creating magic like I’m on a broom
People been shooting up for centuries
16 before it was 1, before history was made by him shooting them guns
Before the information was sent to me
I showed love
Uh, i used to be wearing them gloves
Some protection against them foreign weapons
I kept em snug
Walmart and all them 7-11’s were the plugs
Heard females looking for their baby fathers
Wasn't us
Rode the bus, 121 to 21
131, hold up I ain’t done
40, 76, 100
Can’t forget 15-16, 157
Got a lot of brothas thinking that they ain’t something
You can get everything even when you came from nothing
Just because you jumping doesn’t mean you stuntin
And just because you crushing doesn’t mean you blunt and
Um, I keep it kosher, until it’s over
Chilling on the sofa and I ain’t sober
Guess I wanted that closure
I’ll never have it
Sometimes in order to get the crown ya gotta snatch it
Uh, yeah
Cash rules everything around me, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar-bill y’all
Hey, yeah let that shit ride out

Lyrics from CLB Merch

[Verse]
Put my feelings on ice
Always been a gem
Certified lover boy, somehow still heartless
Heart is only gettin' colder



[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now
This took dedication
This is meditation, higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up, crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This is that: run and get a dollar for the ice-cream cone
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharica
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erykah
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, "Money ain't a thang!"
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game
They know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Tell me one thing you won't do: settle
Give me one word for your chain: yellow
Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A.I
Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah, I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don’t let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, let's celebrate

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Verse 4: Nas]
What up, Nicki? It's Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
'Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after
Champions

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Sixty naked bitches, no exaggeration

[Verse 1: Future]
This Adderall got me to the ceiling (I'm to the ceiling and I)

I peel them hundreds on hundreds
I get that money on money
I get that guala on guala
I get them dollars on dollars
Then throw out them dollars, them bitches gon' holler
I got more style than the stylists
I like that money is piling
I see that money just piling
I see it's piling and piling and piling and piling and piling and piling
We do the favors, them bitches gon' cater
We fuck the models, then we fuck the neighbors
Fucked all the strippers, then we fuck the waitress, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Sixty naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitress

[Verse 2: Drake]
Two in the morning, my mind is on you
Four in the morning, it still hasn't moved
Hit me to tell me you get off at ten
Come here, I make sure you get off again
Roxx got a case, but they get off again
Fuck all the opps and the shots that they send
I let off first, then I let off again
You will not hear from them ever again
Me and my friends, we got money to spend
Reps Up, you know there's a hundred of them
FBGOVO, hundred percent
Don't ask me shit when it come to my set
Don't ask me shit when it come to my set
FBGOVO, hundred percent, yeah
Six summers straight and I run it again


[Pre-Chorus: Future]

[Outro: Future]
Sixty naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Take it to the head, baby, penetration
Money not a problem, you can finger trace it
Drinking on the syrup, taking medications
After this club, we just change locations
After this club, we just change locations
We don't take it in, we just change locations
We don't take it in, we just change locations

[Verse 1: Jenna Gawne]
They can say that you're no good, so hood
Truth is that you hold me down, my baby, just maybe
They just can't see how much your love changed me
It made me who I am right now so they don't phase me
When they blaze me with all of their worries

[Pre-Chorus: Jenna Gawne]
You probably ain't gonna change but I'm okay with that
Yeah, baby, I stay on track, 'cause you know that I got your back
And you probably ain't gonna change your ways but that's alright
Still be down to ride, 'cause you're my one and only

[Chorus: Jenna Gawne]
Anything that you need from me, boy
All that you do is just let me know
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all
Anything that you need from me, boy
All that you do is just let me know
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all

[Verse 2: Jenna Gawne]
They can say what they want to but it ain't true
They can't see you're [?] for me
Cause I know better than to let a
Bunch of them stop telling me
Cause I would never wanna give you up, so why
Do they keep talking when they know that it ain't right?
No, no, no
Can't tell me nothing 'bout my baby


[Pre-Chorus: Jenna Gawne]
You probably ain't gonna change but I'm okay with that
Yeah, baby, I stay on track, 'cause you know that I got your back
And you probably ain't gonna change your ways but that's alright
Still be down to ride, 'cause you're my one and only

[Chorus: Jenna Gawne]
Anything that you need from me boy
All that you do is just let me know
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all
Anything that you need from me boy
All that you do is just let me know
I got you, girl
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all

[Verse 3: Drake]
Stance on, lean, the same old thing girl
There ain't a damn change that the fame gon' bring, girl
Uh, I'm first string, girl, handle a lot
'Cause up north is a scandalous spot
They think I'm pretty and rich
But pick one I'm on a Canada block
In some sweatpants, sandals, and socks, 'cause I can do that
I heard rappers wanna get into it
Until they hear the mixtape and they get into it
I used to pay just to get influence
And now I host [?] with [?], so questioning me
Is nonsense, my advancement is a definity
Something that you rappers pressing to see, and I can do that
You need cash? Sure, I'll make it rapid for ya
You need it faster? I'll make it happen for ya
I bring drama in town, but don't worry
I'ma pull my pants up when your mama around, girl


[Chorus: Jenna Gawne]
Anything that you need from me boy
All that you do is just let me know
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all
Anything that you need from me boy
All that you do is just let me know
Cause I know deep down who you are
And I ain't tryna change that part at all

[Intro]
Stop, stop, stop…
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

[Hook]
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up

[Verse 1]
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so and so’s that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up


[Verse 2]
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin'
Trust me this information is vital
I’m tryin' to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!

[Outro]
(Stop, stop, stop, stop…)
Have you seen me?
I’m doing so good
Every time we meet:
"Oh, I’m so sorry."
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)


[Sample]
"You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak."

[Intro: Drake]
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot (x4)

[Verse: Ayesha Curry]
Put it in the freezer just to chill quick
Oven 0 to 100, yo, real quick
What you cooking with? These is real mitts
Knowin' all the chefs gon' feel this
I'm the real Chef Curry with the pot, boy
Stove is gettin' hot, boy
Olive oil by the box, boy
Avocados for the guac, boy



[Chorus: Giveon]
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

[Chorus: Giveon]
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, "Babe, I think there was a typo"
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday, Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

[Chorus: Giveon]
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?




[Intro]
Breaking news, my niggas
If your girlfriend has went to any
Season opener basketball game
Best believe, she's fucking some niggas on that team
She's fucking somebody on the basketball team
If she's at the game
Right, right, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like woah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?
You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes, she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back

[Chorus: Drake]
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like woah

[Refrain 1: Drake & Ha-Sizzle]
Yeah, rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
She rode it like a, yeah, yeah
I got it, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
You don't wanna fall in love, I know
I'm not someone you should trust, I know
I give Chanel out like a hug, I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...

[Refrain 2: Ha-Sizzle]
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
Burrrrat stick it, b-burrrrat stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it

[Outro]
Thank you, thanks, Drake, thanks baby
Motherfuckers drunk and tired
Tired, I'm tired, boss

[Produced By: Noah “40” Shebib]


[Verse 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, I just got clean rap
I don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me

[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!


[Verse 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy


[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Outro]
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Tyga]
I ball out like the San Diego Padres
TGIF, thank God it’s Friday
Smokey Friday, so high might fly away
Competition’s small so I live big like Tom Hanks
Big bang, 22, nigga don’t believe in caine
Tried everything from sellin’ weed to counterfeit
Counterclockwise, clockwise
Now we countin’ hits
Superfreak bitches made a milli off a porno flick
Good nigga, clean dick
Fuck her right she’ll call again
I ain’t got time for modelin’
Show up lookin’ how your pictures did
Bitch, no call to niggas, but we at the Ritz
Super duper fly nigga so they bug me for a flick
Get it? Flick, flick, choppers on the hip
Make a band, chop a drum clip, I’m T.I. with this
Too ill to reheal or fix son a nigga eclipse
Hotter than Middle East is, pledge allegiance
A star bitch you the realest, I’m a realist
Father, son, holy spirit
‘cause I brought the ghost with me
Let’s toast to the Rolls I driven
You could live in
She give me clit and my clique winnin’
Bank murder up in this


[Verse 2: Tyga]
I got a fuckin’ problem
Baby on me like a toddler
Keep my phone on silent
Vibrate, make that ass shake like a violin
College girls on me while you pressed like dialing
I been everywhere you niggas ain’t
Can’t go where your bitch go, got her up late
Make my dick plank, she gon’ drink it straight
Rotate, let her friend taste
She from the DMV but I ain’t tryin’ to wait
DC, Maryland, them phones they be wirin’ them
Shout out my nigga Wale we be fly like a terrorist
Get money like inheritance
That pussy I’mma wear it out
Yeah we in the strip club
Blowin’ money, air it out
Talkin’ big shit
Let me show you what I’m talkin’ ‘bout
Stacks for the freak show
Told her bring the circus out
I ain’t gettin’ married ‘cause these hoes
They just go around
Ridin’ on the next clique soon as they up in town
Cause I’m the nigga, the nigga nigga
They hold me down if it’s drama
And if it’s drama, I got that loud
Told my girl, Jeffrey Dahmer, and eat her out
Then I follow, and then I follow, dick in her mouth
They say Tyga only got like one hit
Shit, at least a nigga got a hit
Banana make her pussy split
Pornstar, loose lips
Ain’t no room in my circle like a hula-hoop is
Bitch


Groupie ass nigga…

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now

[Verse 1: Drake]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like [Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say "My baby's famous and I knew it" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out

[Drake Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill

[Hook: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And "Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest"
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home

[Outro: Drake talking]
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)

[Hook]


[Intro]
Ha, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?"
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go"
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, "Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home

[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Verse 2]
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home


[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Verse 3]
My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?"
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home


[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

[Outro: Bob Marley]
Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians – them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth here

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout "We" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like "Do you wanna hang right now?"
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she ever say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded, no (Yeah, you said that)
And I believed you when they told me don't
(Yeah, I thought you meant that)
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you


[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Drake]
Swear these days all you say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once, oh
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

[Verse 3: Drake]
Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

[Verse]
I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, "Is that a rose?"
"You mean Rosé? Why yes it is"
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style, you're in need of ya own, man

[Chorus]
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay to say that you made a mistake
You loved me, love just don't fade away
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay to say that you made a mistake
You loved me, love just don't fade away
It's okay, okay to miss me

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay to say that you made a mistake
You loved me, love just don't fade away
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay, okay to miss me
It's okay to say that you made a mistake
You loved me, love just don't fade away
It's okay, okay to miss me

[Verse 3: Drake]
Too mix up in drama to go outside
Too mix up in drama to free my mind
Jealous people around me, I need to change my life
I just turn colder every time I try
What would I do without you, my chargie?
I don't feel that way with anybody
Tell me your secrets, I'm not messy
Steady it for me, girl, hold steady
I wanna put you in my life
Your hair smell like the tropics, your body look nice
One fuck cyaan hold me, we gotta go twice

[Chorus: Wizkid]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Verse 1: Drake

I always wonder why you bother putting makeup on
You don't need it
And even though I always tell you that you're beautiful
I'll repeat it
Cause I don't want no singer, I don't want no model
And I don't want no fashion designer or nothing
I just want your love
I promise you that's more than enough for me
Chorus:
All you gotta do is come real
Shawty what the deal?
Dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way (2x)

Verse 2: Kyoko

Baby just because I wanna look good
Don't mean that I ain't real
Not in the least bit
All the clothes and doing of my hair, face, nails
Make me feel good
And I'll keep it up
Im not sayin what you been stayin to me
Ain't exactly
What I need to feel and know
You're the one I'm wearing for
And where I'll always go when I need a real love


Kyoko Chorus:
So stay real
What you make me feel
Is true beauty of the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way (2x)

[Intro]
Yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same

[Verse 1]
Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through


[Verse 2]
Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through


[Bridge]
Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

[Outro]
Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been? You deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight



[Hook: Drake]
You tryna come up, I am the come up
I be standin' right here when the sun up
You be gettin' done up if you niggas try and run up
You livin' good, go 'head and throw your one up
You tryna come up, I am the come up
I be standin' right here when the sun up
You be gettin' done up if you niggas try and run up
You livin' good, go 'head and throw your one up
Scream out, blat-blat-blat-blatow, blat-blat-blat-blatow
Blat-blat-blat-blatow, how ya like me now?
I'm like blat-blat-blat-blatow, blat-blat-blat-blatow
Blat-blat-blat-blatow, how ya like me now?
It go blat-blat-blat-blatow, blat-blat-blat-blatow
Blat-blat-blat-blatow, how you like me now?
I'm like blat-blat-blat-blatow, blat-blat-blat-blatow
Blat-blat-blat-blatow, how ya like me now?

[Verse 1: Game]
My nigga Funeral Fab told be back in '03
Rap ain't nothin' but cash, money, bitches, foreign cars and trees
Cristal by the cases, bad bitches by the flocks
I know I promised my niggas I'd never leave the block
But, shit changes
I done been through six Ranges
Hand on the Eagle, yeah I got them Mike Vick fingas
Throwin' bullets on par with the accuracy
Hit your whole faculty, like, ain't nobody jackin' me
Before you do, you be layin' in a box
While Jay kiss that ass goodbye, *mwuah*, locks
First shot, leave the niggas in shock
That second shot, that's when that body drop (Ya heard me?)
And niggas still askin' 'bout Detox
I'll tell you if you tell me who killed Pac
Aight then, I'm at this Pacquiao fight then, with Tyson
The way he's stickin', and movin' the knife, Floyd might win

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lifestyle]
Testarossa, keep an extra toaster
It's Hub city's finest, they respect the mostes
My nigga Game do that, my nigga Tyga do that
Heard about the new cat, I whipped the Range through that
I'm in Toronto, DeMar got a condo
Sittin' courtside with Drake, Hector and Rondo
Bitches know my name, it's Lifestyle, she fuck with that
My dick's too big, like my lifestyle, you fuck with that?
Poppin' champagne, we do the damn thing
Standin' on the couch, it's money Game, that's the campaign
Big in my pocket, Obama on my wrist
At the Ronald Reagan airport, yeah, I'm on my shit
Louis Vuitton luggage, peanut butter with the red wheels
Started when the RED Album dropped, I'm gettin' head still
In the club, lookin' past you niggas
These bitches gas them niggas, Drizzy, ask them niggas

[Hook]




[Drake talking]
Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen

[Verse 1: Drake]
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin'
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!

[Drake talking]
Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow

[Verse 2: Drake]
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!

[Drake talking]
Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is

[Verse 3: Drake]
And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime

[Bridge (Drake talking)]
I miss you, most of all, my darling [Beat fades out]
(give me a second to gather my thoughts)
[Fades back in] Strolling in the park (Ho!)
And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)
(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)
(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)

[Verse 4: Drake]
I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive

[Voice]
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring


That shit was wack as fuck

I was like, 'You won. Why are you posting your text message? Just chill. Take your W, and if you feel you didn't deserve it, go get better — make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?

This is how the world works: He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. Whether people wanna say it's racial, or whether it's just the fact that he tapped into something we can't tap into. That's just how the cards fall. Own your shit

To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you robbed everybody. We all need text messages!



[Verse 1: Drake]
I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what? I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky, I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to
But we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin'
On some "why-you-love-these-strippers?" shit
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit, oh!
Oh, me, I don't deserve it (at least you fuckin' know it)
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man, I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer
Hit me when you're done your shift, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
I need some company, I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

[Interlude: Travis Scott]
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby, heat baby
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby
I'm in heat baby...
Mo City trip! Mo City trip right now! Yeah
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
Ayy, ayy, a Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now, yeah
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm a dog
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby, heat baby
I'm a dog, I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off (Broke her off)
When she get too on, we take it off (Take it off)
Drank so long, for a year I didn't cough (Cough)
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions (Straight up!)
Do you mind if we just menage just a little? (La Flame!)

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Mo City trip right now, Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip right now




[Round 1:  Dumbfoundead]
Shoutout to King of the Dot and OVO one time
For flying out Jet Li on a Learjet ‘cause Lil' Romeo must die
My last battle was Battle of the Bay 5
That was 5 years ago when I was ‘yay’ high
I feel paranoid on a yay high
‘Cause with these cameras, this host, and this little pussy…
Am I on Dateline?
I could kill you in six seconds: I should just make Vines
Let’s save time, just say “time!”
He’s probably gon' say some Asian shit
And pull out shoguns, Peking Duck, Ching Chang Chong
Wait, slow that down, did I accidentally diss you?
I said pull out yo' guns, peek and duck, ching chang chong
That shit is easy as fuck, I don’t like to slow it down
When I spit a line, I want y’all to know it now
You always over-explain
That shit is overly done, ain’t y’all over it yet?
Ironic, the shortest motherfuckers always tryna go over your head
How you that small?
You look like a male Bratz doll
You know I actually auditioned for Wild 'N Out
Then I looked in the mirror and said, “That’s not what I’m about.”
They had me rhyme in a Chinese accent
I told 'em I’m from Korea town
Then they asked the black guy next to me to wear a wig and a Madea gown, y’all know him as Conceited now
You’re a D-list celebrity, I’d rather keep my integrity
I’d make more money in my sleep while you sleep with the enemy
I couldn’t have bought my condo with Con dough
I got Dumb money—and that’s not a pun, dummy
Now I got young money for the artist fee
And you also got young money for modeling the cover of Carter 3
Look at his baby ass with his baby tats
You buy your guns at Baby Gap
Your first job, you babysat
When you throw out punches they feel like baby daps
Your favorite rapper is Baby Bash
That’s not a punchline, that’s real… baby facts

[Round 1: Conceited]
Listen here, Dumbfoundead
Now you going against the hoodie type
The gun’ll spit, give you a bunch of tips
I ain’t talking about good advice
Nigga you ain’t cookin' me, the only thing you cook is rice
Aight, which one of y’all Dumbfoundead
Both of you niggas look alike
So y’all finally put Dumbfoundead in front of me
They say you are what you eat
No wonder why this cat kept duckin' me
Nigga, me and this Chin shoulda been battled
I woulda served ya and flamed ya
Don't think that the Dot is determined to save ya
‘Cause they gave me the body I always wanted
Like a personal trainer
So I’ll pull up on that set you rep
Get your stomach cut without doing sit-ups
You better dip, it won’t work out
If I spot you with the pounds that I lift up
When the MAC's out you ain’t doing squat
Y’all better see Dumb bail when I send this Chin up
This kid Dumb is the worst dressed in battle rap history
I mean I hate your shoes, b
You only roll in somethin' fresh when you makin' sushi
And what you wear doesn’t match
Like the lips and words in Asian movies
Y’all move y’all mouths a million times for just one word
And it still be off—why?
They be like, “...........Hi.”
The sound effects never on time either
It’s either like *kshch* or *huhhuh**kpshpsh*
But try that kung fu shit with me, I’ma grip the 8
You don’t want me to cook your noodle
Well, get low, mane, like what’s on your dinner plates
Don’t believe anything this ninja say
Or one word he spit today
‘Cause just like your YouTube clip
We know everything you kickin' fake
This nigga’s name is Jonathan Park
That’s not a punchline, that’s real facts!
No cab when you see an arm wave
You can get hit with the knife
But a toast'll spread when I give Park, K’s
I’ll show up at your front door with a large 8
Right where John stay, it’ll be lookin' like Monopoly
‘Cause I got the metal piece at Park place
You will get wet—grab a poncho, nigga!
I point with the 9 like Rondo, nigga
And you gonna hear a lot of steel like I’m a Toronto nigga

[Round 2: Dumbfoundead]
How you say that kick video was fake? That shit was real
It’s as real as you grip the steel
If I can’t kick it, yo, your bitches will
There's perks to being short, I don’t care what y’all think
When you got small feet, you can get the Jordans all cheap
When you order a shot at the bar, that’s a tall drink
He got three hot tubs at the crib, all sinks
I know these short jokes are getting old
But I ain’t even gotta use those
They’re just starting to grow on me, but you won’t
So I had some of my North Korean homies hack into your emails
I found some very interesting details
Keywords like latex, shaved legs, jpegs of Taye Diggs
All types of gay shit
But I know you ain’t gay, ‘cause you into Asians
But yours look like cavemen
I stay with a bad bitch, what you think is a dime is maybe, ehhh, 6
Like, if you went to a Thai whore house
They be last pick and have dicks
I get the top hoes at the Brothel
You couldn’t reach the top row at a Costco’s
It’s impossible, you’re hella short
You, Emmanuel Louis, Gary Coleman, Martin Lawrence
Lil' Bow Wow, Big Bow Wow, and Kevin Hart
Black Hollywood’s seven dwarves
A bunch of midgets in the woods living large
You seem all tough in Hollywood
But it’s all an act in the end like Bollywood
When I’m talking K pop, I ain’t talking Gangnam Style
I’m talking Gangland files
In L.A. words can get you killed like a hangman round
Lately the battle scene has gotten Iggy Azalea
But I ain’t talking black and white
I’m talking make-believe and actual life
Hear how you glorifying guns and probly gon' have a blast tonight
There’s some kid in every major city in America who’s gon' get blast tonight
You have imaginary guns
Some people have mandatory ones
I seen them Wild 'N Out reruns of you rapping having fun
The homie died the other day, the news ain’t ran the story once
Sometimes I think we both forget that we both sell rhymes
But hook us up to a polygraph, bet I won’t fail mine
With your folktales of dope sales, ain’t no shells flyin'
‘Cause real rounds don’t end when the host yells "Time!"

[Round 2: Conceited]
You and your whole Asian gang, I’ll just use one fist to hit ya
I’ll put my right hand on that yellow circle: that’s Twister, nigga
Double deuce-deuces with these little blickers
I’ll grip the trigger, you could get shot down by the twins
More than Roger in Sister Sister
I’m quick to grip a Wesson or a 12
I’ll let the weapon give you hell
Just like your fortune cookies you can get the message from a shell
You cuff your bitch like she in jail, but she give me mad choch
Yeah, you’re part of the Swim Team, I give her back strokes
She give me fast throat, and do good when she south
Since she eat with chopsticks, she should be used to having some wood in her mouth
But she has the flattest ass and chest I have ever seen
She's such a small skeezer
If I was you I wouldn’t be wrestling to hit that raw neither
I mean she's from China, why would you take her?
No matter what she rock, nothing big shows
From any angle that John seen her
This large nina make sure your nephew and niece are slaughtered
And your aunt may find your uncle been killed like Peter Parker
Nigga, the clip will be on your head, you don’t need a barber
And that shit will “BOW!” like you when you greet your father
I’ll kick in his door, walk in his home
Start wavin' like I’m finna go
When I’m lickin' ain’t no envelope
I’ma hit your sensei, your grandfather, I’ma kill your folks
I’ma bring the Maggie to that yellow family like the Simpsons show
Y’all niggas know I’m gonna sling him
Them 9’s I’ma bring him
And I bring the war to Park like Wild Water Kingdom
I’m bringin' the heavy can
Any problems, I’ll let the semi blam
If things go south, Park, soon as you walk I’ll
Make sure you get caught, man, how can he stand?
Y’all catch that? Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Stan?
Man, that’s why this chinky hates me
If it’s problems I’ll get the shit jumpin' like Mr. Hanky
Now lastly they told me
By the looks of his eyes he might be sleepin' on you
So I better come with it, I should be scared of his freestyles
And be horrified of Dumb's writtens
Had me like, “Shit, in this battle, Dumbfoundead gonna cook and eat me…” nah, just kiddin'
SLOW IT DOWN! I JUST DISSED YOU!
I said, Dumbfoundead gonna cook and eat me? Nah, just kittens
HAHH!!!

[Round 3: Dumbfoundead]
I’m opening up for Pat Stay and Charron, shake my head
I started this nerdy shit, this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
I get the club going up like iLoveMakonnen
You get in the club droppin' names like, “I’m with Nick Cannon.”
He rocks expensive shit and licks his lips, LL Cool J over here
Difference is you’ve been rappin' about dudes your whole career
By the way, what’s all that shit on your neck?
What’s all that shit mean?
Oh, I get it, we all make mistakes when we’re fifteen
This is where me, Tunechi and Wiz link
We got grown-man tats, lil tyger, that shit is kid ink
How much work could they done on you?
Matter of fact, that’s the only time you’ve had a gun on you
Ratatatat butterflies on your back
And some Chinese letters that don’t mean jack
Every battle you do is a short film
Oh, you got unlimited ammo?
Does that mean I could have force fields?
Does that mean I could have orcs, swords, shields
A giant hammer that Thor wields?
Does that mean I could have orbs, pills
Potions to level up more skill?
Just ‘cause you talk about guns doesn’t make it more real
You’re a dork still!
While you and your crew were playin' Gangster: The Gathering
I went on a couple dates with your family
Met his mama on Tinder, thought we had something special
I leaned in to kiss her
She said “SLOW IT DOWN! I JUST MET YOU!”
So I holla’d at his auntie, real polite, real respectful
I thought she’d want me
But she said: “SLOW IT DOWN! THAT’S MY NEPHEW!"
My last resort was his sister, I knew I’d be successful
I was like, all aggressive with it, like, “Let me hit it!”
She said: “SLOW IT DOWN! I’MA LET YOU!”
It’s funny how you think Organik is your friend
But he’s just exploiting you, he’s like Nick Cannon at the end
Yo, but after this, I may never have to battle rap again
But you, you’ll be back up here again
Battling with him, battling with them
Battling with enemies, battling with friends
Wait, what’s your name, sir? Jim? You’ll be battling with Jim!
For you, it’s a never-ending battle and the battle never ends
The end.

[Round 3: Conceited]
We was supposed to battle 2009 in Grind Time
With the bars you ran, so what we need relay for?
You was pissed, I was buzzin'
If we battled, you would be a corpse
So that shows I been made John mad in ’09 like EA Sports
I mean I thought you would sign a deal
You mad ‘cause my views are climbin' mills?
I know that shit was drivin' him crazy
Like when you behind the wheel
I shoot and fire steel that’ll pop at ya
And I light 8 sticks like it’s Hanukkah
Just to get you capped like a yarmulke
That erase this mark like a swastika
I load and flash steel: that’s photographers
And the can it’ll cap it all like Ottawa
Yo, I’m boxin' ya, if we brawl up in this place
You’ll get knuckles all up in ya face
And your head be knocked-off like the Jordans that y’all make
So y’all go and gave me this Chino in TO
Who eats soup named miso, and he’s called a hero?
Nigga, I will take every dollar you got if your gwap got zeroes
Like that movie they was shooting, Heat
Al Pacino’s in the cast and Rob De Niro
SLOW IT DOWN! I JUST DISSED YOU!
I said we’re shooting heat
I’ll put Chinos in a cast and rob dinero
You take this Asian pride shit so far
Your favorite battle rapper is probably Math
I mean there’s nothin' left to talk 'bout
You’re so Asian, when you get hungry, you argue with your girl on purpose so she can put you in the dog house
You take this Asian pride shit so far, you probably love Ryu
And your second favorite battle rapper's Tsu Surf
‘Cause he puts his rhymes in subtitles
I should let the snub light you right now
You’ll let the pipe blaow? Nigga, pipe down!
You ain’t got the Magnum for protection to pop Con, Dumb
It’s not in your lifestyle
I need you to tell me right now
Why do you use “R’s” instead of “L’s” when you speak?
He be like, “Herro! My favorite rapper is Ril Wayne.”
I mean, now that’s the truth, I ain’t racist
I don’t know if that’s somethin' you do ‘cause you’re Asian
But in this battle I’ll give you a L so you can use it in your language
That Ruger get to bangin'
Put you in your place if you comin' for Con dough
Go realer with the bananas
For the monkey business wherever Con go
Why would you think a 9 would miss?
Bullets have no name, but they still comin' for John though
Y’all know S.O.N.S. created a lane for any battler that has bars
Even when you Asians will break
And somebody down and killin' 'em, that’s ours
No, when you Asians will break
And somebody down and killin' 'em, that’s SARS
So even if he did say he’ll burn me like ether when he busts guns
These blickers kick back like 3 Ninjas
You Rocky? Put the Colt to your tum tum
And if you did have a gun, you would give nobody the bucks
You like Lush One


Lyrics from snippet

[Chorus]
All I gotta do is put my mind to this shit
I like all my exes ...

[Verse 1]
Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations


[Verse 2]
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right, uh


[Verse 3]
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off your chest"
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention



[Intro: Shawn Lawrence]
"There’s 3 balls and a strike. Here's the pitch. It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!"

[Verse 1]
Isn't it amazing?
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time

[Chorus]
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends, if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby
Yeah, swanging

[Verse 2]
She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

[Chorus]
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
I'll be here, just swanging

[Verse 3]
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good, girl, like you're famous
I know I'm late, it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl


[Verse 1: Drake]
Right, my yiy just changed
You just buzzed the front gate
I thank God you came
How many more days could I wait?
I made plans with you
And I won't let 'em fall through
I, I, I, I, I

[Chorus: Drake]
I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Jodeci "Cry for You"
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla, yeah
Like controlla, controlla, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Okay, you like it, when I get
Aggressive, tell you to
Go slower, go faster
Like controlla, controlla, yeah

[Bridge: Drake]
And I’m never on a waste ting, shawty

They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree


[Chorus: Drake]
Knowing I'd lie for you

[Break: Beenie Man]
Gyal a tear off mi garments
And a bawl fi come inna mi apartment (Woi!)
Di gyal dem want di length and strength
Action speak louder than argument well

[Verse 3: Drake]
But you can't just diss and come tell man sorry
You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story, nah
It don't work like that when you love somebody
My old flex is my new flex now and we're workin' on it, yeah
And that's why I need
All the energy that you bring to me
My last girl would tear me apart
But she'd never wanna split a ting with me

[Chorus: Drake]
But when it comes to you, you
I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla, yeah
Like controlla, controlla, yeah


[Bridge: Drake]
And I’m never on a waste ting shawty

Every now and then
Counts as a year
For all the things
We do to help
The seasons change

We no longer fear
The bad things that
We caused and it
Doesn't even count
When every second
Is thrown away

Don't think about it
No don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

You gotta do what He demands
Or there will be
Serious changes on the world
Don't look at it
Don't imagine it
For you I'll guide you up


Don't think about it
No don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

Don't think about it
No don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

This is the end
Of it all
Don't mourn about it
Sometime it will
Be put back together again

I don't care
Whether you want to live
Or to die on your own
You just need to trust me
Or you're done for

Don't think about it
No don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval


Don't you think about it
Don't you do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need to support me

That's right
This is the end
This cannot be undone
Freezing to death
Or burn in Hell
It is my choice
But domination rages on

Don't think about it
No don't do anything
You desire to
Live your own life
For you need my approval

Don't you think about it
Don't you do anything
You desire to
Live your own life

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ooh (There's a, there's a)
Whoa, yeah (There's a)
Ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland
Why? 'Cause

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving this crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving this crew
They loving the crew

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Whoa

[Outro: The Weeknd]
'Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4

[Verse 2]
If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city
Need proof, ask your girl's titties, she on the right side
SSL on the left, saying we the best
She wants to be friends with the crew
Take a lot of pics and travel where we move
Model on stage while I'm singing in her ear
20,000 fans get jealous up in here
They don't even care, girl, give it a rest
Ain't no fucking pussy gonna stick out from the rest
Girls with big breasts ain't shit without legs
'Least in my books so put me through this test, so I could care less
Penelope Cruz, Natalie Portman, please holla at your dude
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Don't you forget it, girls like Gia, girls with no visas
Addicted to the life, french girls named Mia
'Cause my chick might be the next Keira Knightley
So baby, you can talk if you want, talk if you want
Talk if you want, talk if you want

[Chorus]
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew

[Hook]
You better cuff yo chick
When you see us out nigga
You better cuff yo chick
You better keep her close to ya
You better cuff yo chick
You better grab her tight cuz you know we got millions for real

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
You better cuff her like a cop
Every time you see bow wow wow wow come around
She love my swag
And she already know how a young nigga puts it down
She said she want a baller, not a bench warmer
You ain't even in the game yet
Can't keep yo broad, you so lame, damn where yo GAME at
And if we in the club you better cuff yo girl super tight
Cuz it just might be your girl who end up in my room tonight
Big pimpin, no simpin, you know just how I does it
Take yo girl, in front of you, and you ain't gone do nothin
She want me to take her home, she blowin up my phone
Even got, "you can get it all" on her ringtone
You girl so out of pocket, you know that she be boppin
She know we ballin, so she wants to ride my Houston rocket

[Hook]


[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Would you please take them handcuffs off of her
Cuz there's so many things I could offer her
Tell her "dead that" and I got the coffin bra
I'm sorry for your lose it must be awful huh
My money tall, yours is like a dwarf so uh
We kick it, I'm down like it's 4th and uh
I think she wanna give me head, how thoughtful huh
You see me in new york, see me in LA
See me in miami, see me in the A
Might see me in houston, or see me in the bay
But its gonna be hard to see me with that nigga in the way

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
No it ain't drizzy, its ya boy em dolla
No I ain't rich, but cuff yo chick by the collar
Cuz if a little nigga like me tryna holla
Then I gaurentee ya'll breakin up tomorrow
I know she your everything, I just feed her protine
Beat it in the bed sheets, and put her in a deep sleep
And when she wake up she always askin for a repeat
I know she rep the "A" but I put her on my B-team
I ain't gonna sell a dream, but the last girl I sold D
I had her relapsin like a fiene
Nino Brown type, what she want in her life
Is a nigga like me layin pipe, you better cuff yo chick

Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood
Came to town with Death Cab for Cutie
I stayed home with my wife and child
And a six pack of beer
I pondered that name for 15 minutes
After I saw the poster stapled to a phone pole
On the corner of Grand and 21st

That was a couple of years ago
I was already in my forties then
So I didn't go out on a whim just to see
A band called Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood
Just because I liked the name
Just because I'm 25 and every day's a stoned summer day
My band's always giggin' then
REM was still kickin' then
I drove that Ford Grenada Mom and Dad gave to me
After they got 'em a Ford LTD
And there was music on MTV
I smoked my manager's pot
And got laid quite a lot

Planes hadn't flown into towers yet
And we didn't have a loose cannon president
We didn't have all this credit card debt
Hangin' over the house like a cloud
Ensurin' there's not much more druggin' allowed
A body won't take it, wallet can't hang
Singin' all the songs I've sang for years
And when it's a band gig it's rockin'
And when it's solo the people are talkin' while I'm singin'
Make me depressed, you think I could take a hint?
My time came and went
Hell there's many nights I came and went
In a manner of speaking my conscience is sleeping
The world is changing the good times are gone
We get to be the folks who greet the dawn
Of an age of distrust, surveillance and sleaze
And bombs in shoes and way too many enemies

I bet their name was Menstrual Blood
And the A&R guy said "That's no good
Make it Mystery and then we can target
A broader base of Goth dog lover market"

I love my boy, he's becoming a drummer
Got a drum kit from Santa, at this rate by summer
He'll be keepin' a beat in a world that needs a metronome
Shoved up its ass so hard that
All voices will raise in the heavenly choir
Shit'll get straight, brothers will hug
We'll dance like we did in the decades of drugs
I'm spittin' my genes in an ocean that's risin'
Clingin' to Jesus with some compromisin'
Of how it was handed to me from my mom
And my daddy the preacher who watched all that TV
In a cream recliner
Scroungin' through life like a stoned hardliner
You couldn't faze him, he knew Jesus
Died for his sins and was raised from the dead
And I've always wondered, why can't he stay dead?
It doesn't change any good thing he said
What matters is his life and not how he died
Why can't he just be a nice Jewish guy?
Who was super clued in and showed us the way
To salvation from sin
And that doesn't mean that you're not quote-unquote "saved"
You fry like a piece of country ham in your grave
It's a great big world, life is a joke
Arabs and Christians, Pepsi and Coke
People so gorgeous it causes 'em pain
And nobody gives any  sympathy for something like that
You suffer in silence or form a band
With a name that appeals to Goth dog lovers everywhere
On a poster that's seen by a forty-ish bastard
Walkin' to work at 8:15
$11 an hour for all that he does
Can't be a has-been if you never was
Goin' all day long without eatin'
Till all my nerve endings are seriously overheatin'
I get wobbly walkin' down the stairs
To smoke me a cigarette in the cold fresh air
Wonderin' why I do the things I do
And I do 'em every day
And it can't turn out good livin' this way
But live this life I must and
In some fuzzy God I trust
I'll kiss my wife, I'll kiss my son and
Maybe someday I'll go for a run
Maybe someday a song will stick
I'll walk around like I got a big boat
Maybe someday my boy'll drum in a
Hippie jam band that plays out some
He'll take after Daddy, get in the van
Go somewhere only young people can
Doing things only young people do
Bangin' those skins at Bonnaroo
Rockin' the dreadheads, dancin' in the mud
Before Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood
God go with him, Amen




[Part I]

[Verse 1]
KM, hop into the building on that gamer business
CEO mindset couldn't cure my mental illness
Ugly and dissociating, man, I feel like Salad Fingers
Hop out of the pool, mutate and kill these horny bitches
This is the place I wanna be, like Jack Black at Freddy's
I be making classics like a Redditor make JoJo reference
Had to leave your girl on read 'cause she don't vibe to gecs and
I'm just gonna dance and die like I'm Michael Jackson

[Bridge]
Like I'm Michael Jackson
Like I'm Michael Jackson
Like I'm Michael Jackson
Like Michael Jack

[Verse 2]
Kylo Ren looking bitch boy
That is not a compliment, bitch boy
Hunt you down by your stench, bitch boy
Mountain Dew code red type, bitch boy
Ayy, bet 2015 was your peak
Just take the fucking L, it's real like Luigi leak
Mentally deranged, but my look's still sleek
Told you I make noise, bitch, I do not speak

[Bridge]
I'm just tryna dance and die

[Part II]

[Hook]
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every

Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Tired every, tired every day

[Bridge]
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here

[Verse 1]
Yeah, why you keep askin' me about... (Why?)
She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it with for the drama?
I've got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now

[Chorus]
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

[Post-Chorus]
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

[Verse 2]
Why you keep askin' me about... (Why?)
Couple other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now

He's not holdin' you down, he's holdin' you back right now

[Chorus]
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Interlude: Drake & Rihanna]
Yeah, ayy
Yeah
I I threw my hands in the air and said show me somethin', yeah
Ayy

[Verse 3]
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house
She made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "When that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' 'bout, "You gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley four-door already
Even as a boy, I was the boy already
So you know that that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy
You would prolly...
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy, yeah
(Why? Fring)




[Verse 1]
Who you think you're talking to
I spent time alone long before I met you
These days lookin' like a dream since I've been on the road
Seein' shit that I ain't seen before and still there's no place like home
Spendin' all my days on the west side oh
It don't feel the same on the other side no
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryin' to put tomorrow in my own hands right now
I ain't like these other bitches ya'll just don't really know
Tryin to box me in that FM Stereo
Where the fuck was you when I was broke and I needed help
Ain't nobody put me on, did that shit myself

[Hook]
I'm tired of you not doing your research look me up
I been on it since I was 3 so look me up
Bet you never know I was so focused about my business
Got no time for all the flirty bullshit I ain't with it

[Verse 2]
Who you think you talkin' to?
I been working too damn hard to let you feel that way boo
Ninth grade I'm done with this school shit man my nigga fuck it
Been on this make my own mind and create my own look shit
Spendin' all my days on the west side oh
It don't feel the same on the other side no
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryin' to put tomorrow in my own hands right now
Prayin' that my family gonna last a little more
Livin' in a city that they can't afford
And that's why I'm 21 and Imma grind baby I don't play
And Know its hard to stunt right here in time check the resume

[Hook]
I'm tired of you not doing your research look me up
I been on it since I was 3 so look me up
You showing me how deep your ignorance is by your comments
The Internet really breeds bullies with false sense of confidence

[Breakdown]
(Why's it so hard to believe)
Why's it so hard to believe that a good... good
And a real one
Really be so on the shit that all these niggas tryin' to hit ya
Shall we need one
Yeah it's so hard
The double standards that we have break my heart
Why's it so hard to believe that she love to
Be selective
And somehow magically could still control her pussy
And be happy bout it cause she gets it
Yeah it's so hard
And all the stigmas that we have break my heart
But you're not ready
To open up your mind and be mature already
You focused on the shit you seen before already
Never laid no visions till they pure already
I'm bored already
Of all the judgement they so insecure already
I was makin' my own music in my home already
You know I'm due for mixtape number 4 already
Already




[Verse:Drake]
Ayye Yo DJ Wristpect let's get em'
Veterans like "How dare all of this arrogance"
What you expect when all they do is draw comparisons between us and Americans
And tell me go hard well I'm going harder now
Bumpin Shawn Carter cause there ain't a Shawn Carter now, feel me
Get with it, I'm trying to overthrow a nation using fade to black as a nigga's only motivation
I'm picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent is proven
A show of hands who's in?
And if you must know, this year I'm going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am  have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that Prada love me
I'm a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for Trinity Chris word
See my role models roll with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough than the whole lotto
So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mimosas with the clicquot
What up Nikko, Jordan, Lucky and TJ nicknamed the Night Fox clique we take it easy
You Prime Ministers claim you repping the T, I need a Motherfucking president to represent me nigga


[Drake: talking]
I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I'd like to ummm
I'd like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Guess I'll call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments

[Verse 1:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes you Aunt Viv
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive
But what you expect though
Kinda direct yo
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick


[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Verse 2:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that y'all believe in
Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling
You losing appealing
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick


[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Verse 3:]
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too
Sayin' to my self you deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin'
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin'
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin' it
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick


[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Drake: talking]
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man (yeah)
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk about

[Intro]
For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'


[Chorus]
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

[Verse 2]
Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention


[Chorus]
Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'



What am I doing?
What am I doing?
No seriously, what am I doing and how did I get here?
Who am i?

This Hermés from runway, this ain't Ralph Lauren
Tell them again, loved her way back when
Drunk so I type "Je t'aime" but don't hit send
Send some bread to the pen
All my G's are blessed, we check in for them
Whole lotta charges laid to this day
No confessions for them

Sponsor (Sponsor), I take a Perc, now I'm turned to a monster (Turned to a monster)
Uh, I'm in the court like "I'm sorry, your honor" (I'm sorry, your honor, lil' bitch, baow)

And I'm a shark up underwater (I am)
I got shooters in New York
And I got shooters across the border (What?)
I call Drake and tell him off 'em (Drake)
Ayy, I call Drake and tell him off 'em (What?)
If they Woo walk, I probably taught 'em (I did)

Fuck sale, so I'm givin' out gift stamps (I am)
Highway, me and Fivio lifted (What?)
London, man, I need me a thick bitch (A thick)
And a Louis bag just so I can fit me the grip in (Grip)

Mike Amiri, best believe they fitted
She wanna fuck, but I ain't with it
Headshot, knock him off his fitted
Punch him out, send that boy to that dentist
Talkin' Henny, it better be Privilège, ayy
Baow, what?

D. Hill (D. Hill)
Ayy

[Chorus: Drake]
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 1: Future]
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string

[Chorus: Drake]
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires


[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy
Self-control has never been your thing
Don't think it'll help if there's a ring with a rock in it
Where I'm from, they serve the soda clean (Clean, clean)
You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan, but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it

[Chorus: Drake]
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires


[Verse 3: Drake]
Ooh, shawty, you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lotta secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, should've stayed solid
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Déjà vu, you wanted things and you got 'em
Déjà vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Déjà vu, déjà
Déjà

[Outro: Mark Robinson & Drake]
Alright, so unfortunately, I'm still here (Hahaha)
But, you know, if you're here, it's still up
In the building
And you just wanna hear some chune, some music
I think, you know, you found the right spot
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
You know, shout out my brother Drake, for you know (Too turnt, baby girl, you know me)
Popping this off real quick



[Intro: Future]
Put that Christian Dior on a Muslim, she feelin' like she was sinnin'
Her family lose faith in a genocide, I told 'em bring 'em all to Finland
I don't mean to admire you, just passion, I'm winnin' (D. Hill)
(Said I was in that UK, get closer to feelin' it)
Had to double back up my double-cup, yeah, yeah
You gotta put up out the city, she can't get any closer
Especially when you're driving a bandwagon after
You gotta put 'em on, she like that

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Woo)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 1: Future]
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees everyday, had to talk to Messiah
I'm in that '81 and this that '82, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all of your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city
You actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I shoulda moved you away from Houston, before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the section

[Chorus: Drake]
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you (Find you)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

[Chorus: Drake]
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 2: Future]
You should have did what you said you would'd do
You should be movin' in silence
See the type girl you hang with, the wildest
Need a better environment
I bought bags to fill up your closet
I pop tags, I know where I'm rounded
I do the dashes, get higher than the mountain
You need class to be with a celebrity
So sad, you lookin' like charity
What you wanna do? See niggas bury me?
All of my brothers are black, carry me
I can't answer you through the legacy
At the embassy speak, it was like therapy
Bought a Patek Philippe in your currency
Bitches can't keep it real with a nigga movin' so desperately
You the one that did the Twitter shit first to see how these hoes react
The only one that can make me feel some way 'cause I love you back
You wanna be my queen, niggas fuckin' on you, think I'ma take you back?
Your bags are secured at home, relax

[Chorus: Drake]
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

[Outro: Future & Drake]
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
California, Santa Barbara, you know, an early retirement (Oh)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know

K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture (Oh, oh, oh)
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah, woah)
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her


[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout


[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs


[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her

If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice

Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper (Nice)
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!

I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her


[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
The farewell email (Yeah) from a female (Yeah)
But I'm a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she's not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can't ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store
And leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her, ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this was all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited, she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It's hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it's juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her



[Intro]
K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture (Oh, oh, oh)
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah, woah)
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two-ish? You ain't gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

[Interlude: Chris Brown & Drake]
So you gonna diss me
Even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gon' miss me a little when I’m gone

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
Drizzy voice
Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper
Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper (Nice)
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!

[Verse 7: Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)
Got a racin' Lamborghini, have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin' ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame (Ugh!)
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself

[Verse 8: Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there

I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her




[Intro: Future]
I'm able to, uh
The stage in my life where I'm
Where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Drake]
Sippin' on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Poppin' tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Ballin' in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor 'cause I been drinkin' that dirty
Bring that Ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup, my drink with me

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

[Verse 1: Drake]
And you know what I need
From you when I get home (Yeah)
You better not be on the phone
Talkin' up a storm like you usually do
Talkin' to your friends like you usually do
Tellin' them I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time, we been

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Drake]
Sippin' on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Poppin' tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Ballin' in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor 'cause I been drinkin' that dirty
Bring that Ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup, my drink with me

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin', you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you can vouch for me
I put the cocaine and the powder in the couch, homie
Whenever I step outside the house, I keep that glocky on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely want her
I'm barely paying attention, baby, I need substance
I know you spent some time puttin' on your makeup and your outfit, but

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

[Outro: Drake]
You doing me dirty (Dirty, dirty)
You doing me dirty
Doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You know (Yeah, dirty, dirty)
How we let it get like this, I don't know (Yeah)
But that nigga can't save your soul (Nah)
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Haven't even heard from you (Yeah)
How can you live with yourself?
I haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself? (Uh)
Ungrateful
Ungrateful (Hmm)
Your mom'd be ashamed of you
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful (Hah)
I'm too good for you, too good for you (Yeah)
You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable (Hah)
Doing me dirty (Dirty, dirty)
You're making me nervous
I haven't even heard from you
You look drained, you look exhausted
Girl, them late nights ain't good for you
Really starting to show on you
Don't hit me up when it's good for you
Ungrateful




[Intro: Wale]
Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm, kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya, I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking 'bout no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you what's better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or, temporary forevers
Shorty get it together, hah, diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'til you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If it's not it baby, hope it's progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby
No more talking baby

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib, I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh (ugh)
Sex all night, couple shots of CÎROC
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing, baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG, them other niggas fell off
Baby girl, I just wanna see you well off

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, Thug Passion
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated
Balmain, rich denim, out in Vegas
French Riviera, baby girl lets take a trip
I'ma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission, hopefully you'll learn a lesson (ugh)
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk
She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 3: Wale]
Something about her, probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on her fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won't ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you? (sweet is you?) Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying to eat, and we don’t need a spoon

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah




[Part 1]

[Chorus: Drake]
Pussy, yeah
Penis down, dry humping
That's how we know, I not cumming
My DaWg would suck my dick for a Louie Belt
That's why he gay, he don't want nobody else
I tried to rape him
I tried to rape him
Goin' on your chest with my dick and ass
Whiteboi Carti, he in shitting mode

[Part 2]

[Verse 1: Whiteboi Carti]
Woooooo, Big round rear, oh yes I like to send 'em nudes
Yeah the gays outside, he like to fuck until we loose
Yeah, dildo boys, that's dildo practice with the lube
That dick way too big, when we pull up send me the nudes
(Send me the nudes!)
I jerked his jimmy, I rubbed his hooves
Had to grab my own towel to clean the lube
Booty always locked down, the cum shoot
Now it's 4 AM and them backshots is feeling coo'
I just sucked your man, slurping up the cock like Jamba Juice
Different colored cocks, so that penis probably looking new
And I'm chokin', man, know them women wish they was a dude

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Some-some-someone said
To swallow the meat, the dick must go deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' with me, let me tickle the feet (Someone said)
To swallow the meat, the dick must go deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' with me, let me tickle the feet

[Verse 2: Whiteboi Carti]
Yeah, this shit way too normal, y'all know I might suck the crew
Big round ass, most of these butts don't have a clue
All of these hoes I fucked with semen I produced
I might take all this booty and put it all in a group
Hit my eses, they send me nudes
'Bout to turn this orgy to dick and poop
Told 'em "Hop in, we fucking too"
On the anal side, niggas suck me 'till the cum shoot
(Don't stop, lick that booty!)
Had to throw my top off, we gettin' loose
He said, "Where you goin'?" I said, "The room"
Then he grabbed me, then my booty groomed
He thought it was the ocean, it's just the lube
Now I gotta open, he sending nudes
Who put this dick together? I'm the glue


[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Some-some-someone said
To swallow the meat, the dick must go deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' with me, let me tickle the feet (Someone said)
To swallow the meat, the dick must go deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' with me, let me tickle the feet

Slept through the pipe, ayy
Knocked for the night, 767, man

Made a right
Cut the lights, raped me twice
Niggas think I'm straight, it's on sight
Nothin' nice, booty lookin' right
Jesus Christ, dicks over rice
That's what I like, that's what we like
Lost my respect, that booty wet
When I suck the cock, I get wetty with my neck
See the cock that I took, that had me shook
Jerk on his jimmy

Like where is he? (Fuck yeah)
No one seen him (Ah, yeah)

Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies

I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest

She want a picture with all of my niggas to just make the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask

[Intro: The-Dream]
I wanna see what's under therrrrrrrre...baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who's that peekin in my window?
Uh, you should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
Wii can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt + Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie?
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs ?light up? when they're in them shoes, ohhh
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off

[Hook: Jamie Foxx] (The-Dream)
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
(She's my digital) girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, GIRL, girl
(She's my digital girl)

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Hook: Jamie Foxx] (The-Dream)
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
(She's my digital) girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, GIRL, girl

Baby, I wanna see what's under therrrre... {It's easy, look lemme explain..}
(Oh baby, yeah baby!)

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
When you take the picture, cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch 'til I reach 3rd base
And when I get home I'ma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date?
"'Ye, the picture just looks so trash"
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacey Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady aaaaat, it
You know what's a crazy thing?
Some girls'll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, 33-Year Old Virgin
That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress white, but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck, I hit her with the text say
"Baby you up," Question mark
And she respond, "YES-S-S-I-R"

[Hook: Jamie Foxx] (The-Dream)
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
(She's my digital) girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, GIRL, girl
(She's my digital girl)

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, uh no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no {fades}




[The Dream]
I wanna see what's under there baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who's that peekin' in my window
You should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
We can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[The Dream]
Baby, not a day goes by, whoa
Without you on my mind, whoa
Donna Karan underwear
Babe, I swear you have nothing to worry about
Baby, I wanna see what's under there
It's easy, look lemme explain
Oh baby, yeah baby

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When you take the picture, cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch 'til I reach third base
And when I get home I'ma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date
Ye, the picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady at it
You know what's a crazy thing
Some girls'll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty-three year old virgin
That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress White, but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby you up, question mark
And she respond, YES-S-S-I-R

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, uh no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no


[Verse]
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, "Where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira


[Outro]
I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I

[Intro: Big Ant Dog & Drake]
I ain't dissin' Drake on this, okay
I'm usin' a sample for it
Shout out Drake
Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse: Big Ant Dog]
Bitches actin' all hard but have they lost they V-Card
Discard that shit I don't want it, But Nate you ain't on Life II
I took you off the album so don't act like that
You tryna move like that
You a fuckin' rat, you snitchin' on me
You bitchin' too I'd beat you up like I'm Muhammed Ali
Slammed you over this shit dissin' people
Like XXXTENTACION and shit you gon' die
I'm gonna shoot you, you conquer me but you masturbate
To Mario 24/7, hoe's ain't shit
I can pop you like a zit
You a pussy like an clit, yo' girl gave me my dick a titjob
She suckin' on my dick, you full of shit
I have the lyrical spit more than you ever do
I can be physical here you tryna hit you miss
I ain't hypocritical wit' the mic so shut yo' filthy mouth
You just tryna suck yo' own dick but it too small to fit
You eat shit off yo' ass this too explicit for these bitches
You just like Jess on yo' ass peggin' yo' ass
I burned her toys fuck the strap-on I don't do that gay shit
I ain't talkin' cap so don't get turned on talkin' beef
I'm too explicit for these hoes they gotta chill
C.A.S you's hoes blamin' me for 'em shit
I hope you shame yourselves
Don't claim me for that shit that's cap
I'm doin' a rap over the shit what you done
I'm done I don't like you bitches
You all insecure y'all gotta chill
Check the score I'm winnin' like NBA
Jess made you a whore Nathan don't fuckin' play wit' me
Knock on yo' door and it stank off shit (Ew what the fuck)
Nathan and Jess you two are dirty sluts
I hope y'all cut y'all selves after this shit
Nathan you got fucked by Jess in Strap-On
Y'all two are a mess I put this on Life II might replace the NB Raps collabs, I just make this like I make kebabs
I just need a map just to get to yo' location
Yo' brain is on vacation, you masturbation to Jess fuckin' you after
This diss track era is my sensation I ain't doin' this shit for clout
Nathan's doin' shit for clout tho' dissin' XXXTENTACION
If NB Raps die we'll smoke his pack (It gonna hit hard)
Damn Imma choke because this hit like a bitch
This ain't jokes bitch
What took this bitch 2-months to respond
Shoot you like James Bond
If you want beef and you a opp than you callin' the cop
You ain't no gangs, you's a bitch
You a snitch go to that pitch black ditch and die
Switch sides and a polices bitch and join their side
I hope you get some homicidal thoughts
I'm gonna catch you lackin'
I'm gonna smack you up and knock you out
Never be a snitch and track it down
I'll do it alone I'd do anything for the gang
I'll take a bullet for 'em
Fuck that shit I don't care if you conquer
You a queer if you talk like that
I hope you fear when I beat you up and you cry like a bitch
Fuck yo' shit, fuck this place
Racist shit now (Shit)
I hope y'all respond badly to get families involved
I'm coldhearted when I have beef
I hope y'all die


[Outro: Drake]
Listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen x10

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm a-a diva (Hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva (Hey)
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (Hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva (Hey)
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (Hey), I'm a, I'm a a diva (Hey)
I'm a, I'm a a diva (Hey), I'm a, I'm a a di...

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla
Of a hustla, of a, of a hustla
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla
Of a hustla, of a, of a hustla

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Stop the track, lemme state facts
I told you, gimme a minute and I'll be right back
50 million 'round the world and they say that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with Benjis, I can't spend it
Tell me somethin', (Tell me somethin')
Where yo boss at? (Where yo boss at?)
Where my ladies up in here that like to talk back? (That like to talk back?)
I wanna see her (I wanna see her)
I'd like to meet ya (I'd like to meet her)
What you say? (Not to me)
She ain't no diva (She ain't no diva)

[Interlude]
Oh no, no, no
Divas, y'all help me sing this next verse
Here we go


[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Since 15 in my stilettos, been struttin' in this game
"What's yo age?" was the question they ask when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her, you see how she gettin' paid?
She ain't callin' him to greet her, don't need him, her bed's made
This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags of that money)
We're gonna stick-up, stick-up (You see the mask, where that money?)
All my ladies get it done, I see you, I do the same
Take it to another level, no passengers on my plane

[Bride]
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
I'm a, I'm a a diva, I'm a, I'm a a diva (I need them bags of that money)
I'm a, I'm a a diva, I'm a, I'm a a diva (You see the mask, where that money?)
(I need them bags of that money)

[Outro: O.T. Genasis]
I be gettin' to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm gettin' too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him, then he bounced right back
I be gettin' to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm gettin' too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him, then he bounced right back
Gettin' to the money



[Round 1: Dizaster]
You American faggot! Now after all the talk about how you would show up and never back out
Drake offered to put three grands on this battle to judge it
And you fucking backed out! Yeah, you little fucking pussy!
I'm in front of DNA, wow! No fucking way!
This gotta be my lucky day
I'm about to tie him to a leash in case he tries to fuckin' run away
Yeah, the problem with you kids is that you lack respect
But fuck me over on money right now
And try to run out and I'ma snap your neck
‘Cause people know
That backing out of battles is not part of my plans
But you and Cortez always lie, so not to my surprise
All your alibis came as a bunch of unauthorized scams
Shit, even if I met you in the middle of the East
You'd find a way to say that I ran
But I'm from Los Angeles, I'm proud to say that that's my land
In L.A. we support our home teams
We got a lot of pride, but goddamn
The way you ducked me in L.A. proves
You'll always be more of a fan of The Dodgers than I am
You soft as hell, I'm not gonna lie, fam
In your battle with Rex, you almost copped a right hand
From Dot Mobb's hopping hypeman
When Rex made fun of your retarded mother
I know you wanted to fight, man
But then they called the cameras off
And you walked off and called it a night, damn!
Sort of like when Eminem told you
"Lose yourself in the moment, you only get one shot in a life span!"
And you answered him, like, "I know, Slim!
That's exactly why I'm gonna walk away from this mic stand!"
Your boy Cortez act on some G shit
We were supposed to battle here
He backed out, like, "I need more cash now."
And that is some weak shit; he's a sneaky latino
So I wasn't surprised when I came to find out that he skipped
He was already flaking like a tortilla
So soon as I saw the guacamole on the side with the green chips
I knew it was only right that that bean dipped
It don't matter what battling league you actually be with
If you gon' be dumb enough to bite the hand that you eat with
At least be smart enough
To cover up your tracks and don't leave prints
Someone call up Smack and tell him to cancel the field trip
Straps with the beams equipped
Like an active Marine ready to damage your queenship
Shells battering, the cannon ring until half of your team is seasick
The other half starts abandoning ship, panic and leap quick
In the same fashion that Hollow took his first chance to get green quick, turned his back on GT
Packed up his bags, took the cash and then he split
And the faggot hasn't been seen since
It's all a story that correlates if you go back and you read script
I use this all as a scenario to reference the battling scene with
‘Cause GrindTime is the ship
And this is bad as the Titanic sea gets
‘Cause without Smack you wouldn't be shit but lost talent stranded across the Atlantic sea without a raft to compete with
I got the long nose like X-Factor
I'll make the back of your Jeep flip
I said, you'd think we were playing Xbox together
The way I left half of your screen split
My guns are barely legal with magazines that'll make this teen strip
That's how you like it, right? Come back with a clean flip!
Yeah, I'm ready for the drama
Ain't no question marks, I'll rip your flesh apart like Jeffrey Dahmer
Let's get it poppin'
I'll take the beef and steady chop it like a chef from Benihana
Speaking of chefs, shouts out to Cortez's mama
‘Cause I heard every GrandTime East Coast event
She be fixing Poison Pen his empanadas
Speaking of him, you'd have to pick up the phone and Pen will call ya, ‘cause you too busy slumped over in the bed with Hoffa
Holding hands with Hollow
We all know you were raised by Dutch Vega and Sara Kana
What's the beef between us? It's been a never-ending saga
I'll leave you walking around with Bender's suppressed persona
When I Sketch Menace your necklace off ya
[…] deadly waters
I'll throw your body on the stretcher
And let the chopper off, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-bah-boom-bah
And drop your paramedic helicopter
I do this for my fans, you mothafuckas ain't shit to me
Are y'all kidding me? I'm fuckin' bum-rushin' the enemy
These knuckles will leave you bucklin' instantly
I’ll fucking get 10 men to start punching you viciously
Uppercuts will leave your stomach in misery
Like muscular dystrophy
That's for thinking you can come online publicly dissing me
You can pop your fists while I'm still crushin' you physically
This shit is child's play
You get ate side ways like the number infinity
I said, you need artist development
Before you come on the blog and then mention me
I'll stomp you out and make you a part of this history
Don't show me that, ‘cause this is about to be the bodybag of the century! Hold on! Hold on! You mothafuckas ain't shit to me
They say karma's a bitch, for you it's probably dentistry
Because the part of your mouth that's missing
Is only a reflection of what's scarring you mentally
So the gap between your teeth
Exists merely as an object of imagery to distract you from the real gap between us—and that's bars and delivery!

[Round 1: DNA]
November 5th… it's ironic, you know, my father died on this day
And I can still remember him telling me
"Son, say what you mean, and mean what you say."
See, I'm only 20, Diz
So in my past battles my emotions might have got carried away
That's why I flew here to Canada
To make sure that won't happen today
So when I grip the 9, rip your spine
Make your body rewind—man, I don't mean that shit
I'll probably never clap the shit out you
But trust I mean every word when I say I'll smack the shit out you
The difference between entertainment and real life
Like, remember when I said I'll fuck you up in Vegas?
Well, dependin' on how this battle goes, I still might
‘Cause, see, I still might
Move back, move back, what are you doing?
Gettin' in my face tryin' to go crazy
Tryin' to fuck me up when it's dead time
When Drake's here in front of the battle
But you ain't gon' make none of his headlines
What I was tryin' to say was
That the difference between entertainment and real life
Like, remember when I said I'd fuck you up in Vegas?
Well, dependin' on how this battle goes, I still might
‘Cause me missin' a tooth only means
I've been in a real fight and got real stripes
So until you get tapped with a sucker punch and missing yours from an uppercut, then you know what this feels like
I took this battle for YouTube views, promotion and fanbase
So I made sure I'm well prepared
Knowing my name would be buzzin' in Sweden
China, Switzerland, making them well aware
So once I get rid of this storm, and y'all see the weather clear
Just think about the end of every other natural disaster
You gone see DNA everywhere
Remember against A-Class when y'all was supposed to go 60 seconds, then on the day of the battle this guy switched it?
Then remember against Swave you had timed rounds
But he said fuck it and you wound up rhymin' for 9 minutes?
Then against me, this guy told Lush, "I'm rhymin' till I'm finished."
Which only proves further you got a problem with time limits
See, you the snake that's tryin' to hide your rattle
Which only shows the Canadian Quarter
Ain't the only bitch that flips when it's time to battle
And that's when I realized, hmm
You really got a problem with time
Like when you say you're a terrorist and a hijacker, I'm not gettin' it
‘Cause if you detonate a bomb
What you gon' set the time to? Unlimited?
You really got a problem with time
I discovered something, Diz, while I was watchin' your battles
And nigga, you have never wore a watch in your battles!
You really have a problem with time
It's not opinion no more, it's a fact, nigga
You do twelve lunchbreaks […]
Change times whenever you want with your hat to the back
What the fuck you think you now? Black, nigga?
Y'all all know, we really got a problem with time, but fuck that!
For the last two years you've been givin' me the runaround
I managed to stay relevant
With every battle reaching over 200 thou'
You done the same, but your music's trash
So the industry will never love your style
Which makes you a earthquake
‘Cause you always gone be a disaster that remains underground
See, you just an entertainer, Diz! In other words: a fuckin' gimmick
And it's for so long that the delivery can mask those fuckin' lyrics
Your rhymes are put together sloppy and unorganized
That's why besides GrindTime we ain't fuckin' with it
So battlin' DNA will be the first time his verses have structure in it
So when you spit all aggressive with conviction
I be thinkin' that you actually mad
And then understand why you hate us New York niggas
‘Cause he drive us around all the time in taxi cabs
Like his rap battle D, he's supposed to be the big bad Dizaster
And when I see DNA, I'ma shoot him and let the 5th clap ya
I said "Dizaster, let's fight!" – he said "Cool, I'ma bitch-slap ya!"
Soon as he hopped out the cab
All you hear on the radio is "Dizaster, it's your dispatcher
Please go pick up Plex Rock and Lush One
And stay away from DNA, you know you don't bust guns
You never touched drugs a day in your life or touched none
And hurry up, your mom's calling, rents due, you must come!"
So when you squint your fuckin' eyebrows
And spit with alllll that aggression
I almost think you might really bust your Glock
But then again we saw him against Arsonal
And you ain't look too good with that fuckin' shot
You gon' try to rebuttal everything I say
Don't act like you fuckin' not, but it's cool
‘Cause a good rebuttal only means I had to say somethin' hot
So don't be confused when he rebuttal every lyric I say
And think he's clever with frees
‘Cause every time y'all cheer for that great rebuttal
You only givin' credit to me

[Round 2: Dizaster]
Man, DNA, you are so fucking hood!
I'm gonna rebuttal everything you say?
Goddamn it, I didn't even know I was that good
Shit, but fuck it, since he wants to talk about time
Then we'll talk about time, when I roll up outside and hurt ya
But you're DNA, you never click-clack the burner
You never commit the murder
See, I do what I want with the time limits
I'll just extend them further: this world's mine, I control time
That's why they call me the Prince of Persia
But you wanna rebuttal too
I mean, you rebuttal'd your missing tooth
But that's not even a rebuttal topic
I mean, you wanna rebuttal a missing tooth
Then make a CD, put out some music, get some money off it
Wait 'til at least you have one deposit
Go to your fucking dentist office
Write him a cheque with a fucking number on it
And if it makes you feel any better about the situation
You can write the word "rebuttal" on it
Homie, listen, it's been since day one I ain't liking you, dude
We can go outside right now and I'm fighting you too
It ain't about punchlines, DNA
I'll just display how I'm a better writer than you
So stop talkin', pay homage, I'm spittin'
I solve problems, I'm an awesome magician
This street magic, I'll make your beef vanish
Like hot pockets, ‘cause all of you chicken
I wanna squab with him, but if your squad is honestly trippin'
That car stoppin', that Glock poppin'
Your top open like Top Ramen before you spark the ignition
I start boxin', Bernard Hopkins
Your heart stoppin', Chris Farley condition
[…] in an arm bar, caught in submisison
Now you lost in the mix, got a bunch of hostages with him
He tried hoppin' the fence, it's an impossible mission
I'm camouflaged in the trenches
Ready to penetrate your army's defences
With these binocular lenses I have a prophet's vision
Is that the hardest kid in your clique? I got a problem with it
‘Cause I'm the motherfucker, I'm what your role model isn't
I'm the armed technician here to remodel your kitchen
With a bomb in it, the islamic edition
Part of your crib gone with the wind, shards of you missin'
Carvin' your rib, disarm the opposition
Then plant the pipe bomb in the car engine
And have Queen Latifah set it off from the distance
My job description: I split wigs like a salon beautician
That .38 is Special like your mom's condition
I know y'all have a problem with the retard jokes
But I only use them ‘cause he has something in common with them
‘Cause when he says he's flippin' to mingle
And he's letting the machete spray
It's not hard for us to see the retarded in him
I don't give a fuck if y'all wanna donate to autism
The truth is — cover your ears, Bishop — the truth is your mom's not even a good example of what being handicapped's about
‘Cause she's a master at that wheelchair
In that I wouldn't have a doubt
Most people, getting around when they're disabled
They find it hard, and you live in a massive house
But she uses the fucking hallways as interstate freeways
Where she gets off at the nearest living room exit
So she can take the fastest route
Weaving in and out of furniture traffic
She doesn't even scratch the couch
But she's kinda like you in a sense, ‘cause whenever she's stuck in a corner she's really good at backing out
Stop touching me! Y'all gon' make a rapping discovery
I don't even know how I can battle you so comfortably
I still can't even believe this faggot's in front of me
Everyday I wake up and I hit a blunt before I even wash my face up
Then I think about your genetic make-up
And how we can make up such a fake fuck
You pussy you duck hunt  you're getting duct-taped up
I'll kill every faggot in your city, I'll even fuck Mase up
[…] now, you're on a one-way truck
About to get ran the fuck over over by a fucking one-way truck
You little fucking pussy! Your face is vaginal
Your mouth is like a vagina and in the center it has a hole
But fuck a camel though, you have enamel toe
It's Dizaster, you know I act like a crude jerk
Your attitude is past faggot, dude
You got a gap in your tooth, gagged and you yapped on your new shirt in your battle with Tsu Surf
I react, I'm rollin' fast, I let the tool burst
Kids will get hit in ass like the back of a Vatican school church
I take stacks off packages, this faggot don't move work
The only cleaning his gap out
Is the only time he digs up or actually do dirt
Two thirds of his life has been a root canal
Conceited influenced you in style
Everything you about to do he happened to do first
Your foundation is missing
Like the roof of your mouth, that is what you worth
I would slap this dude around
But the fact is life is already battling you worse
And that is reality, I know it's sad, but the tooth hurts

[Round 2: DNA]
Diz, you ain't say one thing hot
You still ain't say the fuckin' truth; I've been in about 18 battles
And he still gone mention my fuckin' tooth
And y'all gone cheer ‘cause you think it's nice, people
But that's wack, ‘cause its shit likes to go to the gap
Like white people — so why you gon' keep freestylin'
Actin' like you gettin' it? Diz, you ain't rippin' it
Even your hat knows I'm gonna win
‘Cause it's like Cleveland, you gone lose in the end
Then you wanted to mention my mom being disabled
That's why I hate that you rap, b
You just […] placed in your rap, D
My teeth is missing and I got a face full of acne
When that steel flare
I bet all of these fans will cheer, like Drake in Degrassi
People are rappin', you must be kiddin' me
I'll do you like Pun, have you dead in the middle of little Italy
Thinkin' you can spit with me, you ain't hot as humidity
So why would y'all give him props
For mention my mom with a disability?
I'll go to your mom's house, come through, smack her hard
Come through, see her right quick, then I snatch that broad
Catch her right in the kitchen while she's eatin' caviar
And put that bitch in a wheelchair out the blue like the Avatar
And this the point, see somethin' somethin'
You think that you so nice, you little old clown
You rebuttal half lines, I damn near just rebuttal your whole round
This the point where I pin you down and have Organik hold you
Beat the shit outta you like your pops did when he disowned you
Give you the same treatment
That you did every time you was disloyal
But wait, before I do all that, I'ma expose you
Remember what you told Organik about King of the Dot?
"Your league is fucking shitty, bro
If you ain't gonna give us the help in promotion and gettin' dough
Then why the fuck you attach our logos
Against your bitch-ass videos?
Fuck King of the Dot! We technically invented you
GrindTime's the prototype, we do what you pretend to do
I will never respect this chump!"
Now you over here two years later? I guess time flies loud
‘Cause if you ain't notice
King of the Dot is shittin' on Grind Time Now
And your last three battles been in Canada
So this league basically made you, bitch!
And you disrespected them in a battle? You ungrateful bitch!
You a faggot, I'm just tryna figure out what made you switch
I guess Grind Time held you down and then raped you, bitch!
I couldn't wait to get in your face to tell you I hate you, bitch!
Flew all the way Canada
To put you in a wheelchair: Drake you, bitch!
They said DNA fell off, well, now I'm back — thank you, bitch!
But how's his pop rich and you say you struggle, dummy?
You take battles for free but gotta pay bills?
I guess you don't care about no fuckin' money
For a couple of pennies he'll be ready to travel
So it makes sense when you ate that sandwich versus SMP
‘Cause that's the only time you had bread in a battle
Then you disrespected Jin and his whole race
But I bet you if you seen him you'd probably switch sides
And dick ride and be pole-dancin'
You whine and cry about every battle, I bet you have a fit
That you don't get your way at your folks' mansion
So it makes sense why you hate Asians
‘Cause you always throw tantrums
And everybody knows that battle versus Locksmith
That one counted, ‘cause you showed you hated Asians more
‘Cause when you choked you looked dumbfounded
"But if that's too low, then turn the volume on your speakers up
Your rhymes is weak as fuck
Like the last time Redman and Method Man tried teamin' up."
And when he said that line versus Swave
At first I was like, "Woooh, damn, that's hot!"
Until Method Man co-signed you
And you just disrespected a legend who gave you props
And then if you talkin' like that, then of course he's frontin'
There ain't a course, I get him off for nothin'
This battle's six days after Halloween
It's ironic, ‘cause he already lost to Pumpkin
And he said, "In the MC book, when you fuck up you keep goin'."
And in the eyebrow book, you keep shavin' if they keep growin'
‘Cause I'ma keep it a hundred
My tooth's missin' and them eyebrows is real bushy
So King of the Dot, let's keep it a hundred
One of us is lyin' sayin' we get pussy
When I run up on Dizaster in New York with a Knick's hoodie
He'll back down and get scared and get mushy
Okay, I lied, I see one of us does get pussy
But why do you keep on talkin'
When you act like you know you off the heat?
Me, right now? Nigga please! I'm off the beat
I'll take your body off the concrete and throw it off the street
You got that dog chain on right now
But I'm the one that's off the leash
So why you keep rappin' like you be rappin' when it's dope
You a faggot, I'll clap it, then jack it like your coat
You told Swave you pop the 9, show him like Columbine
You think that you, Blood? Stop it, five!
They brought this yellow tape here
‘Cause Organik knew it was a homicide
So don't act like your raps is hot or you'll blast the Glock
Time's about to run out, you can have your knot
You have a problem with time
So you don't know how to stop on time when your raps is hot
But this Caliente will make you die before the aftershock

[Round 3: Dizaster]
You dissed me about the Canada shit tryin' to snatch my props
I think it's funny how you have to mention Caliente and Aftershock
So you can ride King of the Dot's cock
That's how you fuckin' get around, homie, I'll stomp you
The only reason you mentioned Drake in Degrassi
Because he reminds you of your mom too
I'm basically nasty
There's a couple of questions my fans have been waiting to ask me
Does she really look like Drake from Degrassi?
Is Cortez really on the sideline raking the grass leaves?
You fucking... you wanna get paid more guap now
You wanna get paid like an athlete
But you're on lockout, ‘cause you stay in a rap league
That only caters to Math's needs
When you left your GrindTime family you disappointed them
You made them regret the fact they ever let you join with them
No one forced you off the boat, bitch, it was your choice to swim
Now the only thing you'll ever ever have in common with Poison Pen is the fact that you'll never be boys again
You know what else rhymes with Poison Pen?
Umm, I don't know, "backstabbing disloyal friend"?
When you say "bars over jokes," why you gon' pretend?
You don't truly believe bars are better than jokes
You're not keeping it a hundred and ten
‘Cause you switch it up to comedy too
I always hear laughter when your punches come to an end
Especially when you spit your gun bars
We all think you're the funniest then
I mean come on, dawg, you really can't fuckin' rap with me
I can go off the fuckin' top
And this whole thing will become a tragedy
Yeah, motherfucker, you ain't wanna be the man right now
You fuckin' can't even see me, you can't even stand right now
But I take care of my shit and I can fuckin' kill you all
Yeah, you little fuckin' pussy, I don't feel you all
But since I'ma change up on this topic ‘cause I'ma kill it tonight
I'ma touch up on a topic about why you lie
And everybody's gonna feel it, a'ight?
This is a topic I wasn't gonna illustrate tonight
I think most of the time your brains wouldn't be able to comply
But I figured y'all smarter generation are educated
And figured I wouldn't be afraid to try
See, mainstream science is a bunch of manipulation in disguise
They blindfold you from the real truth
To distract you from a database they hide
Charles Darwin is a faggot who thinks we came from evolution
And later on we changed in size in a different phase in time
What I'm tryin' to say to you is
Why would you believe in that and the Bible?
Those are all fairy tales, goodbye
‘Cause the truth of our genetics is written in the ancient scribe
Our bloodline was given to us from aliens
That came from spaceships in the sky
Now you're wondering why I'm saying this
It's ‘cause based on his name I can relate it to this guy
It's all reality based, all in this equation still applies
‘Cause based on reality
Everything ever said that was about DNA has been a lie
I'm embarrassin' y'all lames
I'm evisceratin' your jaw and I'm tearin' your small frame
Rippin' your fuckin' heart out and leavin' it there in the car lane
You st-st-stuttered when you tried to mention that dog chain
You stupid fuck! You have terrible blog game
Yeah, motherfucker, the "true stories" you're supposedly telling
They're lies and they're basically all lame
DNA hears a story one way
When it comes out of his mouth it apparently got changed
So you're not DNA, they gave you the wrong name
You should change your name into the American Arcane
DNA! Yo, I'm DNA! Hold on! Hold on!
Now I'ma roll up and I'ma come with the 5's and the 6 and the 7's
Now when I go from 8, 9 and 10,t hat'll mean you get hit with 11
That's what you sound like: A, B, C, D, E, F, G
It's always the same thing: if I bodied Rone and Rone bodied Okwerdz, then what does that make me?
Shut the fuck up! Alright?
You're just an undercard to the main star actors
What you gonna do now that Smack don't wanna pay off none of these maincard rappers?
What you gonna do now, huh?
Do like you did in Oun P and spit your little gay bars backwards?
What you gonna do?
Race me in a race track in a race car backwards?
What you gonna do? Come with the metal after you summon the devil from listening to a Lil Wayne song backwards?
What you gonna do? You wanna play that stupid little fuckin' game, then game on, faggot
I'll leave your little brain all trapped
Inside one of your own little gay 8-bar patterns
Like, go ahead, DNA, flip the word radar backwards!
Hold on! Hold on! I can do it, hold on!
So when I roll up with the AR and I spray off clappers
That'll be the result of this battle
If you spell the word radar backwards
Wait a minute, radar… that's still the same bar backwards!
Hold on, hold on! Now when I roll up with the […]
And I spray off clappers
That'll be the result of this battle if you spell the word radar backwards… goddamn it, it's still "radar" backwards!
Truth is, I'll break it down for y'all
Since your boy Cortez, a.k.a. José, won't explain this stuff
I was on the cell all day tryin' to set up this whole thang with Lush
While you in the background with him
Doing roleplay on the phone hangin' up
You think playin' with my money is funny, I'll blow this location up
And I won't leave until I make sure your face gets crushed
Add more flame, I turn your torso and face to dust
More flame, the propane take your soul, raise it up
I'll leave you fuckin' clothes […] in your skull breakin' up
And dislocatin' your shoulder bone from your rotator cuff
You smile like you don't use Colgate enough
Every couple of seconds when you're rappin'
Your nose face gets touched
Like your tryin' to point the way your cocaine is stuck
Or your just another faggot actor
Who thinks he's soulmates with Lux
But Lux is the man… Syke, you're both gay as fuck!
I'll rip Hollow's hand off
While it's still attached to his foam paper cup
It was, like, six in the morning
I saw you and your little sister Jennifer Cortez sit on the corner
Holdin' up a sign that said "For food we're willing to sit on a boner
Polish a ball sack and suck dick for a quarter."
And underneath it said "Please! All we had for dinner was yoghurt."
Your little Smack gimmick image here literally won't work
I bet Math used to punk you and make you finish his homework
This kid is like Conceited
Except he ended up hitting his growth spurt
Your boy Murder Ave doesn't even exist, it's not even a known turf
You guys are both nomads
The only home this ho has is literally his own shirt
Look at you rubbin' yourself tryin' to keep your composure
You ran away fuckin' Smack
Because the events they had were bigger and doper
Always bitchin' that Grind Time couldn't give you exposure
So you walked around for like six months
With a chip on your shoulder, before you decided to jump ship
Hoping to get you a little bit closer
But swiffed out on our interest
‘Cause you were the diva that was tippin' it over
And the sad part is all Smack had to do to bribe you
Was promise to put some rims on your stroller
They offered Cortez a new fisherman boat
So he doesn't have to swim to the border
And Hollow Da Don got a brand new Nintendo controller
People always said your boy Cortez looked like Pitbull
And even though he's the same identical poser
Now I believe he's a pitbull
Since I seen him switch up on his owners
Listen here, bitch, you have a listening disorder
Your mission is officially over
If you think you gon' beat me I'd rather hire Jin as my chauffeur
Yeah, I'm a F15 engine versus a 1960 Corolla
And you're missin' your motor
I'll run up in your crib with them soldiers while you're sippin' a soda
Catch you slippin', put you in submission and fold ya
Then jump up and put my kicks on your sofa
Like Tom Cruise did to Oprah
Yeah, what's going on, pussy?
It looks like that type of shit you cannot respond to
You said on the track 1.25 seconds on your song
About your dad gone that you never clapped a revolver
Yeah, remember? One minute, 25 seconds
You looked up to the light and screamed out
"I've never touched a drug or busted a gun in my life!"
You never clapped a revolver, I'll flat-line you
Snipe at your heart like the final boss you battle in Contra
So act like Manic, so act like Manic, I'll pop ya
Give me that deadly stare, I'll let it air
Leaving shells everywhere like Italian pasta
You roll with a pack of imposters
You don't wanna scrap, I'll pull a MAC and I'll sock ya
Get bitch slapped with the impact of A-Class crashin' his Honda
I'll strike you faster than the Black African Mamba
And send your body bag back to Rwanda
Battling me is worse off than sharing a bath tub with Blanka
Or getting a back rub massage from Mortal Kombat's Baraka
Your breath smells like asshole and cacka
You need to grab some Binaca
I'll backhand you and I will damage your chakra
The day you beat me is the day everyone in Canada considers Sno an actual Rasta
What you know about weed?
Your whole life you probably only seen two bags of ganja
I'm a YouTube superstar, everyday I have new fans
From Deutchland to Jakarta, from Buktan to Combala
Dominican Republic, and Yucads in Cabanas
Kuala lumpur and Sri Lanka down to Sudan and Uganda
But all you have is two fans: you're Kitana
I saw you wearing earrings that one day, fake-ass shits
Put on, probably put on, start wearing Prada
Instead of fucking worrying about what you wear
You should try and display some honour
You scared to come to California
Afraid I'll put them Grapes gangstas on ya
But every time you rap it's about how you bang your llamas
And how you give my brain caps and you be making trauma
And how your homies rolled around Vegas
And shut the whole baby down and start creating drama
But that doesn't make you crazy
That makes you like QP's baby mama
You never shot a gun in your life, like you said
Yeah, and that's the reason why I'm having major problems
With the way you were brought up
But it ain't your fault, that's why I blame Madonna
Come on, dawg, let's kick some facts and just be honest, huh?
You went to Smack, put up a stack and you peed on it
And that is a fact, I ain't gotta actually speak on it
Far as your Facebook statuses, the average is three comments
You leave today with a stash in your jeans pocket
Then I'm smackin' that green off it
You went to Smack, got jacked for your bread and didn't […] demolish you're average at best
And to add to that threat this MC's polished
Fuck what this faggot just said, I rapidly clap with that lead
And rip a patch up the back of your head like Rasheed Wallace
Your mom's fucking retarded, I mean it!
But it's not the same, ‘cause she's also a genius
She gives a lot of brain: she's a quadriplegic
I don't give a fuck about her eating problems
She can exercise some different feeding options
She can't use her hands, they shake
So if she wants to have some steak, she puts the knife between her toes and uses her retarded feet to chop them
But no matter how good she gets at holding the silverware
She always seems to drop them
And then stands back looking at 'em
Like, "If only I had longer reach like Dhalsim."
But I don't want no beef, your mom's a G from Compton
Any moment she might show up at King of the Dot
And get them heaters poppin'
So I better flee before she acts like Stephen and brings the hawk in
You rapped about your dad in the beginning
That's some shit I wasn't gonna say
But I'm an evil motherfucker, so all that shit you were talking about, I think that shit is gay
Yeah, I will fly him out of his casket and I'll slump the faggot
I'll fuck your mom in front of her and I'll soak the mattress
Then I'll throw the broken prophylactic on his open casket
I will forge a stack of boarding passes
Get on board a Concorde and crash it
Into an overpass during morning traffic
Who said that? Come on! Admit it, homie! Speak up, brother!
I'll go back there right now and I'll fuck your mother!
Callin' fuckin' Organik like he fuckin' owes you somethin'
Motherfucker doesn't owe you nothin'
‘Cause you don't know nothin' about strugglin'
Look at The Saurus and Illmac, yeah, look at The Saurus, cousin
They're battling for pride
If they lose today they're going home with nothin'
But you're too much of a pussy, a battle you won't go judgin'
You'd rather be a fuckin' homo and just vote on public
Yo, who the fuck is talking, bro? Yo, who's talking?
A'ight, I see you're offended because his mom is being brought up
Okay, that shit is some harsh stuff
But this is battling, what do you expect?
This is the type of shit that pops up
What? What?! Y'all fuckin' mad his mom is brought up?
I don't give a fuck if they have special needs
They got all types of foundations to get their guap up
I don't know about y'all, but
I've already donated enough money from my heart into that large cup sitting at the counter in every single Starbucks
Fuck you! Don't ever fuck up my battle!
I'll pick up your bitch and I'll hump her like my camel

[Round 3: DNA]
Did anybody see who he was talking to?
No! Me neither, so why'd y'all think that was hot, y'all?
‘Cause you looked up there for five seconds
And talked to something unknown, like a blocked call
So, Diz, why do you think you getting hot
And, like, you gon' grip a round?
Me, DNA, I'm in Canada my first time, I'll rip the town
Show you how I'm the illest
And I'm the realest with the sickest sound
He kept mentioning Hollow, but it's like his battle with Hitman
‘Cause when I pull it out I won't miss the pound
See, if y'all really think about that
Now I'm gonna try to stay calm and keep my cool, b
But I've been watching King of the Dot battles
And I saw a dude that had potential we would soon see
And I don't like bringing up people that died usually
But truthfully, this faggot should've died instead of Bruce B
You're not a shot buster, at Blockbuster you wouldn't move E
You dick ride and switch sides, you a groupie
I don't know that much about Canadian change
But I tell y'all truthfully
I know for a two dollar coin he'll be on his two knees
So, Diz, why would you even start though?
You act like you gangsta and you tough
Like you got the heart though
You a bitch, I'll have more whips at your house than a car show
Smoke him down, just like a Marlboro, never at heart though
Since he think he street in Canada
If it's war, then I'll mark him and leave his face with a scar, bro
Dizaster, I have a question: why do you rap like this?
You spit no punchlines, but do all of this
Why do you act like this?
See, you wanna act crazy, like, you could stop with this
This isn't a battle of battling
This is a battle of Dizaster battling Alcoholic Anonymous
He's standing here in front of Organik
Thinking that he's the rapping answer
And I bet you wish you can get a disease
So you can battle cancer
You think you're so nice so you can rap for weeks
Dizaster has insomnia on purpose, so he can battle sleep
I bet your grandma's 97
And listens to "Arab Money" to get her party off
You make bombs so much you wake up to car alarms
If your man's name was Puff Daddy
Then you'd suck off Sean and John
I show up to your mom's house
With pepperoni on a Papa John's
And take it back when she opens it and tell her it's ramadan
So, nigga, why you acting tight?
I heard they sling out here in Canada
I seen today you stayed calm, you ain't vexed
But how the hell you ever expect to be the King of the Dot?
Nigga, you ain't Rex
See, y'all don't get how I can switch that, nigga, when he's next
I broke that down, King of the Dot, Dot Mobb, T-Rex
Oh, see, y'all might not get that with that bar
Matter of fact, uhhh—that was okay when I make rhymes
But I bet you get the bar
When I let off this gun and let that K shine
Ran into his crib when I set you off with that burner shoot
And after that you get murdered
And murdered even worse just like Murder Mook
So why you keep talkin' like you the best, cuz
Now I'ma get on some other shit
Disconnect your body, they won't find where your head was
Now they over there with the morgue
The doctors don't know where your leg was
Your family come and try to see you in the morgue
And they don't know where his head was
Now, you looking, he's just a John Doe
So when his DJ goes to make a "best of…", they gon' have to put a question mark in front of his name, like ?uestlove
Now we here in this battle, Diz, so say what you say now
If you act up, then come through, I'll let off that tre pound
Why talk about a gun
When I got dawgs on each side, like Greyhound?
Beat you up to the part 'til you can't even stay now
You won't have a future, like that nigga from 8 Mile
Run around with the sixty
And leave your body on the playground
They'll be nothing but your soul left, just like James Brown
Pick him up, snuff him
And watch me spin money online, like PayPal
And he still gonna try to rhyme
‘Cause he gon' act like he's better
Dizaster, you think you so tough with these bars
But I really don't think you better
You can never come through and act like you fresher
I found out that his sign's a crab
Which means that he's a cancer
And that explains why you always crack under pressure
So, Diz, why you gon' act like you goin' when it's hot?
How can you respect the nigga
That disrespect the dude for making a song for his pops?
But he gon' act crazy like he fear harder
But since you mentioned my dad, you reminded me of him
‘Cause after this, y'all won't see your career goin' farther
So why you wanna act like you step beat fast?
Nigga, I pop and leave, like dead beat dads
And then he wants to talk crazy
Like you come through and smash your men
If I could do this then, Dizaster, we'd fight
And I'd beat up this fag again
I heard Hollohan's in jail, that's all cool
I wish he could be here to rap again
But if y'all all know the Bible the only way God can come back is when the disaster end
So how you think you dumb funny?
How you just say I was scared to battle for three stacks
But then you came at Drake? That's why you got young money
And you never have cash when you grippin' it hard
So, nigga, I'll blow your brains off, then blow your other brains off, then blow your other brains off
And keep changing wigs, like Nicki Minaj
It doesn't make sense, Diz?
So why you think that you straight hotter?
If I don't know what I'm saying when I don't make sense
Well, nigga, you don't make dollars
You never had money in the rows when know I'm getting silly
If this don't make sense
Then how come we only battled for $750?
Now come through when you act like you crazy
And you fuck with that; tell the truth, Diz
We could've battled on Smack for double that
But you tried to do it here at King of the Dot
And I said, "That's cool, I plan it."
‘Cause you never get nothin', you never act up and blam it
You're a waste of a nut
You shouldn't even belong on this planet
And, truthfully, you should've got fucked up
By the cops instead of Organik
So why you keep acting like you so tough
Like you can spray shells?
Aw, you're yawning while I'm rappin'
That's all cool 'til I spray well
You think that I can't do what you do
I can do it better when I Raylell [?]
Just think of this battle with the L.A. initials backwards
‘Cause that's what he's leaving with: a L
See, Diz, you wanna keep rappin' crazy
When you try to act like you flow like best
But you can't come through, nigga, I put a hole like chest
Now I ain't even come through to rap with it
I'ma show him how Smack and quick
Gon' dap this bitch after that I clap the clip
He keep movin' his head back until I smack it quick
You a faggot that I never come through and dap you, bitch!
I'll run up in your crib, real too, and smack it quick
And shoot him while he's writing with his pen
Now that's how you air a bic
And that was a half punchline, that ain't even the half of it
Now I'ma switch up and talk to this nigga in Arabic
Hedat, your family told me you're a maniak
There's a thousand words in the Arab dictionary
But my favorite one is Eddifat
Ella Stasi, ‘cause these dudes wanna keep talking with the clip
But after that I'm like "Pulla Misha Marka!"
‘Cause that means you're a bitch
And after that I'ma say "It's getting hot in here."
And Ik Fala Watchi! Y'all know what that means in Arabic
Get him the fuck outta here!
So why this dude acting up like he playing with me?
Oh, you thought we was in Canada
So they wouldn't say it with me?
Nigga, please! Why you play inside?
That slogan is like Boost Mobile, that shit's nationwide
So why you acting crazy with the best shell
These clips will make you sprint
And find your body in the next tell [?]
Why you keep talking like you bet for sure?
Oh, you know about the hotels we in?
You on the 6th and I'm on the 7th floor
That's cool, nigga, so stay up
After I blast with the shell, I hate to leave him on the elevator
‘Cause he'll be going on his way up
So you keep rhyming, Diz
Keep spitting all these bars when I clap ya
Acting all hard, but see, you not a real dude, you just a actor
It doesn't matter what you say
‘Cause you're gay and you just a actor
You can't do what you do ‘cause, nigga please, I'm the pastor
Break you down [?] crumble you're body like Ritz crackers
‘Cause I got a question y'all: what's a disaster to a rapture?
He can't move it on that blink screen
You so stupid you can't do what the blinks, D
I kill him in fucking 7HD, a HD, come through
Turn his body soul, rip it apart and have it lookin' like gangrene
Fuck up your soul, have your body lookin' like brinkscreen [?]
I'ma teach your old teacher stupid I make greenery
So after I do that when I spark fiends
Shoot him in his pockets with money
And you gon' see that wall green
And after I do that on a nice day, hit him with that nice tre
Then doctors and paramedics
Gon' be having to find the right aid
‘Cause I'll run up on that whip, when I'm steerin' now
I see that he's fearin' now, I clear the town
Bishop Brigante ratchets
I shoot it in your face and tear that mirror down
You clear the town when I'm offin' the dome
‘Cause right now, please nigga, frees, top of the dome
I come through—fuck that!
Like you said you always talk about poppin' the shone [?]
But after I shoot I'ma have to off his top, like Charron
And he keep thinking he coming praisin' when you on that
You acting like you can freestyle
And rhyme, nigga, like you move on that
You say that you like rhyming nerdy
But I don't get it when you cool on raps
‘Cause every battle you have with a street rapper
You talk about guns like you on Smack
So, Diz, how does that make sense, when it's so lovely?
You said that you didn't shit on King of the Dot
And now it's so lovely
Now you gon' try here get in my face and try to punk me
So let's break it down
On exactly what he said about this country
Nigga, who are you airin'?
You just stand six feet tall and didn't do shit
Nigga, who are you scarin'?
Like, what's wrong with this dude?
I had to tell him five times and maybe one time?
Like, we know, you know, we both freestylers
So why would you do that? So I can make a punchline?
Like, I don't get it when I blam it
Now back to what I was talking 'bout with Organik
Like I said, right? This dude gon' act like he's on his grown shit
When I mentioned King of the Dot, you should've said something, but since you didn't I'ma rebuttal your own shit
Like when I said you disrespected King of the Dot
And that was lovely, then you should've replied
Well, then Organik disrespected our country
And that's when I would've told you
I'm disrepectful for spittin' in your face
But I got more respect for Organik
‘Cause at least he did it in our face
And you pussy, you never hold the 9 and spray
Like when you said "Canadians are faggots!"
"Canadians are faggots!"—you did that shit miles away
So now that we here in Canada
And you said they have no military, they have no healthcare
And Canadians are faggots—say it again, Diz!
(Diz: DNA's a faggot!)
No, say it again, Diz, about Canada!
(Diz: Canadians are faggots! Boo)
Diz, what's going on here? Things startin' to change
You see you're on your way now
You heard all them boos, you kinda looking like me on 8 Mile
But now he acting crazy when he's poppin' it nice
You tried to talk about me with Eminem droppin' the mic
But you think it's all cool, somethin' somethin', the best in?
Well, you just booed in front of the same presence
In front of a worldwide legend
So, like I said, say Canadians are faggots again!
Repeat that! Exactly my point
He ain't do it this time, because, to me, I mean that
So why he keep acting crazy?
Acting like he all tough blammin' a razor
I just came to King of the Dot
And got rid of Dizaster—I'm Canada's savior!




[Intro: P. Reign & Future]
P. Reign! Reps Up!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Drake & Future]
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk

[Verse 1: P. Reign]
Life is great when you’re naked, you press the gas and I break it
I drink liquor don’t chase it and I get women don’t chase ‘em
I’ll put her face in the pillow and watch her bite on the blanket
See you tempted to taste it, get every drop and don’t waste it
I’m fucking with you, I’m fucking with you
The type of dick to make that white girl say ‘’I love that nigga’’
I’ll hit your Instagram and click like on like every picture
You get it from your momma? Well then bring ya momma with ya
And lots of liquor
Tell her "fuck me like you hate me," "You love me?" I said maybe
She said "boy don't keep me waiting"
And I say "go down, don't be lazy"
Yeah, now that's my baby, that's my baby
She love me for my drive, I love her cause she drive me crazy
What's up?

[Hook: Drake & Future]
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk

[Verse 2: Drake]
OVO I ride, OMO I ride
Reps Up, them my niggas from the Scarborough side
Don’t fuck with them, or hollow tips will fly
I don’t have to lie
Lot of people say it in a song just to say it
Man, I’m not that type of guy, hit me on the cell
I just might bring you to the city
Send you home with stories you can never tell
I’m tryna break you out of your shell (And what?)
You just turned 21 like Adele, that’s good with me
I put my business on hold
Let me turn off the phone, let’s explore the unknown
If you not drinking with me, you force me to turn up alone
No peer pressure, I just know you like to get in your zone
You say that you’d rather smoke, well, let me call up OB’s room
And tell ‘em roll up a cone
I know he probably got that extra special (yup)
I never second guess it
How's Villanova? What classes you taking next semester?
Man, she like, "Fuck the small talk
I’m not here to discuss extra credits or my professors"
No time for funny stories
It’s funny how she shows up late, but always comes before me
We both young and misguided, but that’s another story, yeah

[Hook: Drake & Future]
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on

Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk




[Intro]
T. Slack, I promise I got 'em, homie!

[Verse 1]
I turn the phone off, I let the seat back
I'mma be out for a minute, I'll bring the heat back
The jet-setta and forever will I get chedda
And y'all will only get cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Plus, the hoodie cover my eyes
I'm too pretty, nah, I'm just playin'
Heavy is how I weigh in
Top floor with a view of the water is what I stay in
But y'all don't hear me, yeah, y'all ain't relatin'
Well, let me tell you what happens when I be datin'
These chicks with ass fully skip they class
Catch me at the hotel and try and get they cash
But, I'm not stupid, nah -- I'm tight fisted
You tryna sex me for money is quite twisted
Prior to fall, I was lying to y'all
So if you gettin' one ring, I'm denyin' ya call

[Hook]
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doing his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feeling where he's at let him know
He just doing his thing
Gotta love that

[Verse 2]
Now my momma kinda iffy, My uncle kinda shifty
Expenses at this point have cost a little over fifty
The hummer and the range was in someone else's name
Hope my city's reputation for the summer's gonna change
I hope you stick around and see it
Cause if you ain't around I'll bring your chick around to see it
Until she catch feelings and I have to let her go
And when I park my car outside she'll stick around and key it
Repercussions of a cheap lash
Had me doing repaints, just to get em re-scratched
And get attached do insane things
Take new jewelry and put it down the drain things
But, that's just the drama that the fame brings
Fresh prince tryna touch sky like
Mr. Busy, Mr. Recieve the shipment
It's Mr. big dreams, no more than 2 months commitment

[Hook(2x)]
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doin his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feelin where he's at let him know
He just doin his thing
Gotta love that


[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one boy
And he's the reason it happened, but he's overreacting
And it's all because he don't want things to change

[Hook]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

[Bridge]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, he knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)
[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

[Bridge]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)


[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

[Bridge]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)


[Outro: Stevie Wonder on Harmonica]

[Hook]
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Verse 1]
Tonight I’m into breaking up
Somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone
I-I-I-I’m with my people
I know you love it
I don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
It's just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby, forget about it
I'm headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it
My judgment's never cloudy
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman, weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I’m polite about it
Baby, after you
I’ve had a glass or two so


[Hook]
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Verse 2]
Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to B.I.G. and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask what's up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love I don't think should happen
'Cause everything's easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, I still run the committee
N.Y. forever nigga, Diddy


[Hook]
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Uh, yeah, alright
Uh, well alright
Yeah, well alright
Uh huh, yeah
Feel good

[Verse 1]
It's a celebration, clap-clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscato
For the girl who's a student and her friend who's a model
Finished the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where ya tats is
Show me where ya hands at, maybe I can grasp it
They say if ya get her you can understand her better
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her
Yeah, and I got it together
So when they talk they try deter me it's like whatever
Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself

[Verse 2]
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya
These girl groups with they overprotective managers
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place
Yea... but if you never even been there
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air
I know that shit is exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself

[Background: Snoh Aalegra]
Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary
More Life



[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Don't let me fall asleep
I got something in my drink, babe
And it's pink, baby (And it's pink, baby)
Don't let me fall asleep, no
Don't let me catch no Zs, no
Keepin' it on "read", keep an eye on me
Oh, Keisha, oh, when you get done, done, done, done that work come over
Girl, come over (Ooh)
Come over girl (Girl)
You don't need no panties, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Do you feel? I feel, baby
I see all your emotions tonight, I'm floatin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
More blue dot, more champagne
More girl-love to feel the pain
Don't let me fall asleep
I'm tryin' not to

[Verse 2: Drake]
Keisha get done, done, done, done at work, come over
You got a lot on your shoulders
Listen to me 'cause I'm older
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But Keisha get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me
I wish you had met me way before I met you
You have no idea what I have seen and been through, no
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
You don't even drink at all, you're sober
More blue dot, more champagne
More girl love to heal our pain
Don't let me fall asleep

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Don't let me fall asleep
I got something in my drink, babe
And it's pink, baby (And it's pink, baby)
Don't let me fall asleep, no
Don't let me catch no Zs, no
Keepin' it on "read", keep an eye on me
Oh, Keisha, oh, when you get done, done, done, done that work come over
Girl, come over (Ooh)
Come over girl (Girl)
You don't need no panties, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, oh


[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing

[Refrain: Drake]
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

[Verse 2: Drake]
I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' (Stressin' over somethin')


[Refrain: Drake]
You, you, you, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart
Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart

[Verse 1]
Sent a message to my Instagram
You's a vegan but you going ham
Lotta niggas, lotta niggas
Lotta niggas wanna be like me
But you know the difference
You know it's different, baby
Yeah

[Bridge]
Only bang OVO for me
Let me know you're down
Let me know when you're downtown
Ring-a-ding, ding
Let me know if it's a ting
Out here with your Brampton tings
Fucking all your Pickering tings

[Chorus]
She said she wanna come to Toronto
She wanna come to the 6 side
She know that's the best side
Caribana, soca dancer, Machel Montano
Black red bandana, oh, a trip planner
She know who to check when she come around
She know who to check whenever she comes in town
She knows what I have to calm her down
She knows it's not something to run from now
Don't run, don't


[Verse 2]
Listen, all I wanna do is smoke with you
Sit down, have dinner with the folks with you
Touch road, hit Fring’s then Bloke with you
Don't par with a broke boy, I'll do the most
Would you tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Since when are you all grown up
Since when do you know Mona
Since when do you not come home
I heard you got too much on your shoulders
Your mother just called my phone up
Sounds like your party is over

[Bridge]
Girl, you know I heard a lot of things, don't joke with me
Girl, you know I
And I know you're down, I know you're still down
Ring-a-ding, ding
Let me know if it's a ting
Out here with your Brampton ting
Fucking all your Pickering tings

[Chorus]
She said she wanna come to Toronto
She wanna come to the 6 side
She know that's the best side
Caribana, calypso dancer, Bajan accent
Blue yellow bandana, oh, trip planner
She know who to check when she come around
She know who to check whenever she comes in town
She knows what I have to calm her down
She knows it's not something to run from now
Don't run


[Outro]
Pace yourself, pace yourself, don't run baby
Don't run, baby
I know you're scared
Inception is everything you're wanting
Just trust me
I'll take it easy on you, babe
Just trust me, just trust me
Just trust me, just trust me
I'll make it easy
Just trust me, girl
I'll take it easy



[Intro]
Yeah

You know what's different, baby

Let me know you're down

Ring-a-ding, ding
Let me know if it's a ting, yeah

She said she wanna come to Toronto
She wanna come to the 6 side
She know that's the best side
Caribana, soca dancer, Machel Montano

She knows what I have to calm her down
She knows that it's not something to run from now, oh
Don't run

[Verse 2]
I wanna smoke with you
Sit down, have dinner with the folks with you
Touch road, do Fring’s then Bloke with you
Don't par with a broke boy, I'll do the most
Would you tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me?
Since when are you all grown up?
Since when do you know Mona?
Since when do you not come home?
I heard you got too much on your shoulders
Your mother just called my phone up
Sounds like your party is over

[Bridge]
Heard a lot of things, don't joke with me
I know you're down, I know you're still down
Ring-a-ding, ding
Let me know if it's a ting
I stay with the downtown ting
Who the real Queenstreet king, oh

[Chorus]
She said she wanna come to Toronto
She wanna come to the 6 side
She know that's the best side
Caribana, calypso dancer, Bajan accent
Blue yellow bandana, oh, trip planner
She know who to check when she come around
She know who to check whenever she comes in town
She knows what I have to calm her down
She knows that it's not something to run from now, oh
Don't run


[Chorus: Dwele & Drake]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl? (Yeah)
I can't believe it (I know you got a man)
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything (Kick it to you like this)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Why you over there looking at me
While your man standing right beside you?
The temporary happiness he might provide you
But you know and I know that nobody gon' do you like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line-of-sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly, I'm kinda like
I don't really wanna hit this girl
And still, she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playing around
It gets deeper and colder, the funny thing is
I'm writing this in my head as she asleep on my shoulder, like...


[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Verse 2: Big Pooh]
Look, we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreating
But that was then, you know, some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus, your man still there, let's be fair
You'd do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past some late-nigh- smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he
Late nights, 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, 'cause I been the other man
And you not gonna trap me with your silly lil' plan
It's my bad, should've chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl, playing
I'm saying, you need to do what you do
I'm not tryna take it any further with you, c'mon


[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man?
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Ugh, ugh, I met her at the bar, sipping on Patrón
And now, it's been three years off and on
'Cause the same page, we are rarely often on
'Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (C'mon)
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb
But regained it while she was building a house and home
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that she don't know what to do with her life
'Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute, she mad at me; next minute, it's all good
And I'm in her body like "Gray's Anatomy"
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (Ugh)
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, "Damn, if only her nigga knew," but...
(Hahaha, yeah)


[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything, baby



Don't, don't play with him, don't be dishonest (Ayy)
Still not understandin' this logic (Ayy)
I'm back and I'm better (And I'm better)
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Boy, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
But, she only fucked you over 'cause you let her
Boy, I guess he didn't know any better
Boy, that girl didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say she been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of her right
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' my thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' she must be trippin'
Play this song for her tell her, "Just listen"

Don't, play this song for her, play this song for
Don't, play this song for her, play this song for

You gon' have to do more than just (Say it)
You gon' have to do less when you (Do it)
Lil mama you know I (Show it)
Always want you to (Prove it)
You gon' have to do more than just (Say it)
You gon' have to do less when you (Do it)
Lil mama you know I (Show it)
So you gon' need to more than just (Prove it)

Oh baby
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car, let it go
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car, let you know

I've been working on it, putting in overtime
Putting in overtime, putting in over-
I've been putting in work, you know I've been
Working overtime, working overtime
Working over-

Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change, yeah
But me I just see the switch and I'm dose
Can't tell which is which and I'm dope
I'm a just do my thang all the same
In my own lane way out of range, yeah

Boy says she keeps on playing games
And the loving ain't the same
I don't what to say, bout you
What a shame, if you were mine you would not be this sane
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switching lanes
And the thing on fire baby no propane, that good
Boy can I be frank, keep it 100 boy
Ain't no saint, she the only reason that I'm feeling this way
Giving you the world baby when you get space pain
Can you give me life baby thats been a treat, oh baby

I said don't
So give me all of you in exchange for me, yeah ,yeah
Don't
So give me all of you in exchange for me, for me
Yeah
Don't, play this song for her, play this song for, don't




[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 1]
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 2]
Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall

I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Bridge]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do




[Intro: Drake]
I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!

[Verse 1: Malice]
Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do

Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you’re clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It’s like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got ‘em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
And a pen for any beef trying to approach us
Let the sucker burn, I don’t even flip 'em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain’t seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, I'm hot as hell and I don’t even need a stylist
Spit the infernal like the Real World Challenge
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You’re running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis
I ain’t gotta use a fist, slap you with the chalice

Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later, how am I the man still?
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side, bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yellin' out, "Pay the guys"
Man, I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to—

[Verse]
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, "Okay, if you say so"
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah
I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to— oh, wait, sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
SZN

[DJ Semtex]
When we hooked up years ago, you were supposed to come on the show, it didn’t happen but we connected the day after and did a legendary interview in Hyde Park. I said it felt like you’re gonna make history

[Drake]
It’s been a while, that’s kinda how we ended up here. When I got here [London], I was just like in my room, just tryna find my lineage of coming to London and just trying to figure out where it all started. And I just watched that Hyde Park interview and I’m watching this kid, it’s me but to me it’s just a kid that’s just trying to talk, trying to answer questions in the best way possible. Just the fact that we were just walking around, just me, you, a microphone and a camera. I was like “man I should hit Semtex up, man we should talk again”. I feel like that was a good conversation, we covered a wide spectrum of things and I think it’s been a long time since somebody’s been able to sit down and do that with me, and that’s how we’re here

[DJ Semtex]
How’s it feel to go from doing mixtapes, So Far Gone was the mixtape that really broke, before that Lil Wayne mentioned you in an interview with me, and I started following you and it’s just grown. From there you’ve been non-stop, its crazy…

[Drake]
Yeah that was an amazing time for all of us… still doing it with the same people. It was just… our landmark for that project is 15 Fort York, which was “40” and Oliver’s apartment and we really started that project there. Then it moved to the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA, when we were first just getting around Wayne, I know Wayne mentioned me in the interview, but the real turning point for me was when Wayne went on stage at the MTV awards and rapped one of the verses from ‘Money To Blow’. Instead of doing his own verse he just impromptu rapped one of my verses. And at that time, people are like, people from back home who really didn’t….. I mean it was just a tough thing to believe like, “I know he says he’s over there but is he gonna come home with a Lil Wayne record, is this gonna really happen” at that time people were like “ok he just rapped Drakes song, if he gets a Wayne record this is outta here”
That was when I was able to come back off those trips with Ransom. I went back home with Ransom, which was the first time I had ever got a Lil Wayne verse. From there I had a bunch of songs that I had recorded at the studio called Hot Beats and Wayne just got on all of them like ‘Stunt Hard’ and ‘Forever’ was one of them, early early. Then we started crafting that first project and using the input of two people who again I still work with to this day and my music wouldn’t be what it is without them, that’s Oliver and ‘40’ – you know it’s funny cos we’re sitting here talking and they’re back in Toronto executive producing ‘More Life’. Oliver’s executive producing it and ‘40’ is obviously always involved, but kinda just a full circle moment for us, cos Oliver had so much input on ‘So Far Gone’ so I was like “man it would be nice to do something with me and you again”, so I gave him that task and he’s at home piecing it together. So yes it was a great start and from there it just became a wild journey that I guess we’ll talk about

[DJ Semtex]
A lot to talk about – ‘More Talk’…
Since we’re right at the beginning, I was in Amsterdam with Lil Wayne….and he tells me – Yo he’s been writing on ‘Detox’ that was like the mythical album, you gotta be about your business to be involved in that, or to be in the studio. How did you end up from doing a tv show to working with Dr Dre, writing for him on Detox? It’s taking it back…

[Drake]
Its taking it back, I’m not usually that good with the ‘taking it back moments’ but I actually remember this one vividly. But yeah, I was on the show and while I was on the show, I started getting less and less character time, because of the fact that everybody was taking a notice to just the fact that I was more focused on music. And at the time I actually had a studio that was right by the film studio for Degrassi, so I ended up working out a deal with the after hours staff where I would leave work, go home get my stuff – Degrassi was all the way in the east end, which is Scarborough that’s like an area of our city. I’d go home all the way back to the city, get my stuff, come back to the studio, I would record and around 4/5am I would sneak back into Degrassi, they’d let me in and I would go to sleep in my dressing room. Eventually they found out what I was doing and they got really upset. During that time I was crafting all these songs, and I had a song that Omen produced – it was me and Mickey Factz and somebody else was on it I think. So Dre had heard the song and he had hit me like, “man I need proof that you wrote this” (laughs), so I had to fax him the lyrics of the song, I had to send him a fax message, from my moms fax machine in her bedroom I sent him a fax

You know at that time, Detox was going on, it was more like he had just a camp of people, I guess churning out ideas and just trying to spark something. I was flown out to record at Record One, which is a legendary studio. Yeah I was in there for a while, I did a lot of work, me and ‘40’, always brought ‘40’ with me, that was like a stipulation in my career, I wouldn’t move without ‘40’, so brought ’40’. Got to meet a lot of great people, obviously got to work with Dre, and it kinda all came to an end, when I.. Dre brought me into his office and said “Man you’re doing really good work” and he gave me a $10,000 cheque, and it was the most money I’d ever had in my life and at the time I was in a relationship. So I got the money and I called my girl, and I flew my girl down to L.A and was like “we can get a hotel this is crazy”, it was just a joyous moment for me. And I had missed studio or I had done something wrong, I had let my mind deviate from work and I had missed something, and next thing I know I was sent home and that was kind of it. It was a huge life lesson for me and I still have that… Actually when Dre came out at the Forum, I brought him the $10,000 cheque cos I had saved the actual hard copy of it, even though I got the money for it, they let me keep a copy of the cheque
So yeah that was kinda my dealings with that very early on, and I had heard rumblings, like oh all these people are here and I had met Snoop, and I kinda wrote this song, that ‘40’ still has somewhere for Dre and Snoop. We listened to it not to long, couple years ago, its kinda hard. But yeah it was a great experience, a great learning experience for me and ‘40’, it brought us closer and it just taught us about how this shit really works and I think that set us on our own path

[DJ Semtex]
So lets fast forward to 2015/2016, VIEWS one of the most successful albums, the tour you did in America was the most successful tours. How do you feel about what you achieved with VIEWS and the reaction? It’s a very pivotal point for you, going from writing for Dre and being on a TV show all the way up to …


[Drake]
Yeah I mean, it was one of those moments in my career, where the album started to build and build and build and you know when anticipation starts to build, it can either result in massive failure or massive success. Obviously somebody’s watching over us and it resulted in massive success for us and it was also just an opportunity for me to really take a lot of risks that I felt I was ready to take at that moment. And yeah, I mean I was obviously very proud of it from the title to the cover, to just the styles of music that I felt we introduced almost as a package. It kinda started with ‘Work’ because ‘Work’ came out before my album, and then progressed into ‘One Dance’, ‘Controlla’, ‘Too Good’. But just the style of music that was making me happy at the time, because to be completely honest with you I was having trouble figuring myself out in rap at that time I was a very defensive individual just coming off the situations that I’d come off of. I was having trouble trying to make rap music where I was able to peel back the layers and every time I’d make a song – ’40’ is always really bluntly honest with me and was like “Man you really sound like aggressive and defensive” – and I was just trying to figure out why and I realised it was just a reaction to my previous situation that had kinda happened before that

So there was a time where I actually thought about taking the rap off of VIEWS and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody. But obviously I know why I’m here, I know who my core fanbase is, and so towards the end of the album, I tried to execute it as best as I could, on the rap end. You know I still listen to the bars and I know exactly where I was at and they are great to me, and they are time markers to me, but yeah, I guess we’ll get into ‘More Life’ after and how that situation progressed. But yeah VIEWS for us was, it was surreal, the numbers and all the things we were able to achieve, it was an incredible time for us. And of course in true OVO fashion we didn’t celebrate it all, we just kinda went on to working on the next thing. That was kinda it, it was just another album to us, it wasn’t my biggest album by any means, it wasn’t the one to me, it was just another chapter in the story but I’m very grateful for the people who enjoyed it and supported it. Whether people want to admit or not, the influence that it’s had on music, I feel is very evident, whether people don’t wanna say it

[DJ Semtex]
Did you know what you were doing when you made ‘One Dance’, Kyla’s on there, Wizkid is on there, it’s a truly global records, because I think very few people have done what you’ve done with mixing everything with the US, the UK and African sounds. Did you know how big it was going to be, it was the song of the year

[Drake]
It really all started with the Kyla record, it was just a song that I had played, we Dj at our own parties just because …

[DJ Semtex]
How did you discover it though, that’s like a UK underground Funky Sound…

[Drake]
I mean I just listen to a lot of music and I have friends with great taste in music, so I’ve been personally putting that song in my own playlist and DJ set for like four/five years now, I know it’s older than that, even just playing it and having people… What really set something off for me was having people in America come up to me and be like “Yo what was that song you just played?” and I would be like “man people really like that song but they don’t know it”. So I just, my brain started working of like how could I utilise a bit of it, there’s so many good pieces. So I introduced the concept to ‘85’ and I said to him like “man if we could make a beat, I don’t wanna do a cover I wanna write a whole new song, I just want Kyla to serve as the bridge or as a bridge to the next verse, or as a bridge to the next hook”, and he was like “alright alright cool”

I had the beat for a while, I was just trying to figure it all out, and at that time I had met Wizkid through Skepta, cos we did a remix of one of Wizkid’s songs together and it just kinda all really fell into place naturally. And when it was all said and done, it was one of those moments much like ‘Hotline Bling’, I just didn’t really know how people were gonna feel about it, and that was part of the reason why I dropped ‘Pop Style’ along with it, cos I was kinda almost nervous like man I don’t know, this is just so different, let me just make sure I drop a rap record, so people just know I’m still on my shit. And I remember Boi1da had walked into the studio one night and he had heard ‘One Dance’ and he just looked at me and he’s like “man that’s gonna be the biggest song of your career to date” and I was like “c’mon man it’s like, that’s a lot to say, we hope it does well”. And yeah he was right, and it was just the perfect marriage of a lot of things, so many thank you’s to Kyla for being so supportive, she came out to South Africa and shot a movie with us for this song, and you know of course Wizkid doing his thing, and yeah just the entire UK for supporting it and the world for being open to listening to it

I love that tempo, I love that cadence, those melodies, that’s the music that makes me happy in life, so it was great to just be able to just make something like that and shine light on a song from the UK that deserves it, because that’s truly a classic song

[DJ Semtex]
With ‘Pop style’ what happened with that, because when I got it originally it was Jay-Z and Kanye on it and they kinda weren’t on it?

[Drake]
Yeah, I was dealing directly with Ye and that’s the version that he sent me and that was what we talked about and he was like “man you know this is like ‘Pop Style’ featuring the throne, this is huge” and I was excited obviously anybody would be excited to see them link back up. And then I didn’t know what I was gonna hear. So when I heard Jay had two bars, I was like alright it is what it is, it’s cool I like that, it’s a little intro and Kanye goes off. And then you know I’m not really sure the details between how that conversation was miscommunicated or what they were going through at that time, or what anybody felt towards me or whatever it was, I’m not really sure but next thing I knew it just became a bit of an issue. And you know from there I don’t waste too much time, so I just was like alright cool I’ll finish it, I can rap as good as anybody else, so I’ll just go finish this song and put forth my own version cos I don’t really like… you know no one can dangle anything over my head in this business, I don’t play that. So it just needed to be done and I did it myself and yeah both versions exist, so when Kanye comes out to do it at the shows it goes crazy. I know he was really upset cos at that time we were working together pretty heavy and he really wanted to be on the record but you know…


[DJ Semtex]
On the Pablo tour, he said a lot of things that are well documented but he said, before the last show, he was talking about how he was sick of not being able to do certain things everyone should come together and just make music. Is it digital politics now that prevents things from happening?

[Drake]
I don’t know, I think everybody has their own little things going on, I’m not really sure what he’s referring to half the time, cos in the same breath, I went from being… like working on a project with him, to him sorta publicly shitting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much. But yeah I’m not really sure, everybody’s got their own thing going on. Again me when I hear that, I just distance myself from it you know, alright if that’s what it is I don’t really even understand the point you’re trying to make but whatever it is that you’re going through, I accept it, I don’t respect it at all. You know cos I feel like me and Khaled are just good people, I’m not sure why we’re the target of your choice that you made that night. And yeah I accept what you’re going through, and I just go and continue working on my own thing. You know the more and more this progresses, the more and more I just feel like keeping to myself, cos its just so unpredictable, you never know which way people are gonna go. I mean streaming is the new record business, so yeah I guess you could call it digital politics, that’s kinda a good name for a song, I might have to do that when I get upstairs

[DJ Semtex]
So with ‘Childs Play’ another banger, there’s a line on there where you say why you acting light? What does that mean?

[Drake]
Oh you mean “I’m acting like I’m light skin”, that line (laughs), that’s just sorta something people… that’s like very an American thing people say like ‘ah man’ you’re being light-skinned”, I guess they say it’s like ‘emotional’ you know. I just think it’s a ridiculous stereotype, but I was just kinda playing on the irony of it, cos I’m actually light skinned so it made me laugh so I said it. But yeah it’s just a silly stereotype in black American culture, that light-skinned guys are this way or that way, so that was just a little joke

[DJ Semtex]
When did you first experience racism, you’re coming from a dual heritage, your fathers black, your mothers white, it puts you in a predicament, when was the first time you really noticed you get it from both sides, or one side or the other?

[Drake]
Man you know, I’ve really been grateful in my life to be born in Canada and just the journey that I had growing up was so… it was just a very accepting journey. I always had friends from all different backgrounds, from different walks of life, we all get along, I never really notice colour, religion, we don’t live like that. There’s really not that much segregation in Canada, and especially in Toronto, it’s like a cultural mosaic. And I know I’ve said that time and time again, but it truly is, it’s made up of so many beautiful people from beautiful places and you get to actually learn and you don’t ever develop hate. You know, the first time I really experienced it, was when I got famous and went to America and people would challenge me, like I don’t understand how it works or like “your Canadian, you’ll never understand, like the Black American struggle, or you’ll never under…..” That was the first time I really got challenged, and it was by people I had met from America that were like even close to me at the time

You know, if I ever feel anything or if I ever feel like an outsider, it’s usually because I’m not American to be honest with you, that’s when I feel like people are against me or they feel like I’m not part of the…. I guess it’s got something to do with the fact that I have quite an eclectic make up, I am mixed, I am Jewish. Yeah but I feel like, at the end of the day when it comes to everything else I’m Black. I am referred to as a Black artist, last night at that Awards show, I’m a Black artist. I’m apparently a ‘rapper’ even though ‘Hotline Bling’ is not a rap song. The only category that they can manage to fit me in is a ‘rap’ category, maybe because I’ve rapped in the past, or because I’m Black, I can’t figure out why. Just like I can’t figure out why ‘One Dance’ wasn’t nominated, maybe because they can’t… I mean, well it’s just there’s pop obligations that they have and I fluked out, I fluked out and got one of the biggest songs of the year that is a pop song and I’m proud of that, you know. I love the rap world, I love the rap community, but you’re right I write pop songs for a reason, I wanna be like Michael Jackson, I wanna be like artists that I looked up to, those are pop songs but I never get any credit to that

And shout out… and by the way I’m speaking to you as a winner from last night, I won two awards last night, but I don’t even want them, cos it feels weird for some reason, it doesn’t feel right to me. I feel almost like alienated or you’re tryna purposely alienate me by making me win rap awards, or either just pacify me by handing me something, putting me in that category, cos it’s the only place you can figure out where to put me. And remember they don’t decide the winners, but they do decide the nominations so they have to play it politically. And shout out to Chance, for last night, like I said I’m speaking from a winners point of view and I’m so happy for him, I’m not talking about.. I’m not angry about how last night worked out. But when you ask me like where, like do I feel, like racism, or do I feel it the same as everyone else, yeah I feel it, I notice it going on in it’s own places. But thankfully I get to be around the greatest group of people, my friends are from all over the place, they like Lebenese, they’re.. I’m Jewish, most of my friends are from the Islands of Jamaica, English, so I mean, we just don’t really notice it like that until I start talking about the music business

Yeah it’s a really tough time in the world and again that statement has been said over and over again and I think we know it’s a tough time and I’m …

[DJ Semtex]
How did it feel to be on stage in Manchester when the Grammy’s were going on, you stuck to the tour..


[Drake]
Yeah I mean I did it because that at the end of the day is what matters to me that’s real life you know. I was pitched by the Grammy’s to cancel those two shows and fly and go sit in the audience to lose because they don’t air the other rap awards on TV. So I would have left 30,000 people hanging to sit there and just be there for their own ratings you know. The worst part is I expressed myself, like man I’m really thankful I was at those shows in Manchester cos those were two of the strongest shows that we’ve had so far. I texted somebody from the Grammys and was like I’m really glad I stayed behind, I really don’t wanna have this conversation about coming out there again and I got a text back that said ‘Blame It On Donald Trump’ – and I’m not gonna say who it is that I’m texting but this is like the institution, we’ve been conditioned to think that this it the true award for our accomplishments, for our music. By the way if you had a night like Chance last night, he deserves it, for his friends, for his family, for his collaborators, its amazing when they champion you. But all I’m saying is, to kids that will be coming up in the future and might now get championed or might not get that moment, that’s OK too. Because you have to realise what institution you’re dealing with. You’re dealing with a bunch of people that are just people at the end of the day and they’re either good people to the core or bad people to the core and we’ll never know. But I mean yeah, I was really glad that I was in Manchester last night, and like I said I’m speaking from the perspective of a winner, I won two awards, it’s just it really put it all in perspective for that thank God that I stayed here and did what I’m supposed to be doing for the people that actually care about my music, you know. Yeah man, that’s just kinda how I feel about that about this given time

I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates, I send the Maybach out in neighborhoods
They never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I'm in this ho
But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled "Surprise!", I wasn't surprised
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Of course...

Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
When I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Aw, yeah

[Chorus: Jai Paul]
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

[Outro: Jai Paul]
Don't
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't




[Intro]
I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay

[Verse]
So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eat
Keep gettin' temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time
Y'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my name
And I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, "I'ma done him for you"
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to you
Considerin' that we just sold another 20 for you

[Outro]
To be honest
Duppy


Coming Soon

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, oh, gone on them)

[Chorus: Drake & Young Thug]
She tryna take it all off for me (Tryna take it all off)
Tryna stay real close to me (She tryna stay real close)
I gotta catch myself (I gotta catch myself)

Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy

[Verse 1: Drake & Young Thug]
Railiza (Ow!), you need a... money and visa
And you get what you want, always from me
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No"
Howisha, you need a... (Ow!) baby with me, uh
And I'm takin' my time, just wait, don't leave
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No" (Ow!)
You wanna drink like Bajan and dance like Trini, yeah
You want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie (Like mi real friend)
Yeah, vacation is done, but I'm not finished, no


[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Young Thug]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning (Pardon!)
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, gone on them, gone on them) (Ow!)

[Chorus: Drake & Young Thug]
She tryna take it all off for me (Close) (Tryna take it all off)
Tryna stay real close to me (She tryna stay real close)
I gotta catch myself (I gotta catch myself)
I can't play myself, I need to take it

[Refrain: Drake & Young Thug]
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I bet I never disrespect you, darlin', uh
I beg you pardon me, darlin'
I see you roamin', ridin'
Work outfit on, she ain't joggin'
Yeah, I see right through your body
You need a younger to give you guidance
She say I'm the youngest, but I treat her the nicest

[Chorus: Young Thug]
She tryna take it all off for me
She tryna do it incog with me
She tryna stalk young darlin'
I plan on fuckin' every girl in the world, but I'm takin' it


[Refrain: Young Thug]
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, mm-mmm

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I raised change for you, I gave all my stain to you
You know I bang for you
Even my main know I got a thing for you
Walked in a aisle, anyday for you
I'll go under maintainin' for you
Jump when you say, like a kangaroo
Cryin' over you, and it ain't nothin' new

[Bridge: Young Thug]
You let me wear your watch, then I fucked your girl in it
We danced drunk, then we hurlin'
She presented a gift with a shit-face
I'm tryna fuck every girl in the place, but I'm takin' it

[Refrain: Young Thug]
Easy, easy, breezy, easy
Easy, breezy, easy, breezy



[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's

[Hook: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please

[Verse 2: Richie Sosa]
I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, ain't nothin' much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin'
D boys jugglin', single mother strugglin'
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbor's house, I'm on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
But both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
My left arm's like David Wells
My right arm's like Holliday, so I'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
For just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up

[Hook: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please


[Intro: Kevin o Chris]
Yeah
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah
Yeah
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah

[Verse 1: Drake]
First time I saw you, I wasn't thinking of you and I
I was just thinking of I
First time we fucked was at my place, it was a couple years late
But it was fate and I think you feel good about it
So now we end up in this place we both hate
And I think it takes a sacrifice
Not fair, it's not right, it's impractical
For you to leave that man and come and just be mine

[Chorus | Refrão: Drake & Kevin o Chris]
Try, you won't even try
It's simple, it's simple
Vai, rebola pro pai, novinha, vai (Vai)

A mãe quis prender demais sua filha
E virou um controle sem pilha
Pra que foi maltratar a menina?
E hoje de maior o Kevin cria

Vai, rebola pro pai, vai, novinha, vai (Vai)
Descendo, (Vai) descendo

Yeah
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah

Yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah

[Verse 2: Kevin o Chris]
Ela é do tipo que gosta muito de conversar
Mas não fica de papapá
Vai se despindo, deitando na minha cama
Prontamente conversando, ela tira a minha roupa
Essa menina mete muito gostoso
Dá pra ver que ela gosta do que faz
Novinha safada e simpática
Deixou o Kevin com gosto de quero mais


[Chorus | Refrão: Kevin o Chris]
Vai, rebola pro pai, vai, novinha, vai (Vai)
Descendo, (Vai) descendo

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse: Drake & French Montana]
If you need me, you can call me, I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (Bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (Wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne (Haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: Drake]
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me, I begin to write the thesis
Franny got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marineland, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer, I'ma be tweakin'




Got a lady on the line
Screamin' 'bout what she need, oh
I done got this call a thousand times
I'm leaving, rushing to see, ooh

I got the sirens on
(I'm running every light)
She says she's home alone
(I'm needed in her life)
Until I get there girl
Stay on the line

It's an emergency
I'm rushing there to handle mine
It's an emergency
Cause we ain't got a lot of time

I gotta save her, if I'm any later
Somebody might get there before me
Emergency, that 911's for me
Emergency

When I got there, put her on the floor
She leakin' but she still breathin', ooh
Give her mouth to mouth a little more
Repeat it to show her I mean it, oh

I think I know what's wrong
(Lemme turn off all the lights)
She won't be here for long
(If I don't get this right)
Girl, I just can't lose you
So hold on, please

It's an emergency
I'm rushing there to handle mine
It's an emergency
Cause we ain't got a lot of time

I gotta save her, if I'm any later
Somebody might get there before me
Emergency, that 911's for me
Emergency

It's a good thing that you called me when you did
Cause you were slowly fading and wasn't gon' make it
I'm your doctor, see, these tools I'm working with?
I need to operate, I need you to be naked

I can feel your heartbeat, uh, uh, oh
Beatin' like it's so deep, uh, uh, oh
Give up on you never
I'll make it better

It's an emergency
I'm rushing there to handle mine
It's an emergency
Cause we ain't got a lot of time

I gotta save her, come any later
Somebody might get there before me
Emergency, that 911's for me
Emergency


[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ah
You've got me fe–
You, oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?


[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is "Leave me alone"
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then


[Outro: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher

[Intro: Rick Ross]
I'ma tell you like this, nigga

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I got a hundred Gs on my line
I ain't eatin' Jacksons when I be in Overtown
Bitch I'm eatin' lavish, look up, ho, it's snowin' now
I just throw the cabbage, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League gon' hold it down
Got a odor there in the attic, that's a couple pounds
New Rolex that I ordered, that's a hundred thou'
Time to milk the game, bitch I went and bought a cow
My nigga GDK a goon, he'll gun you down
Slid up on him with the stick, yeah and sat him down
My nigga Nut so slick, they ain't pat him down
I got a hundred niggas on my line
A hundred squares at a time, nigga, hold it down

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack


[Verse 2: Drake]
Alright my patience runnin' thin
Olympic pools of money, I'm just glad I learned to swim
Cannonball, bitch, I hope your diving board's sturdy
And I hope when dinner's cold, my niggas do not desert me
Nah, but shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And these haters pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person, man I wish y'all would
I say you lucky if your father was a figure
Cause my uncle was my father and my father was my nigga
And my mother so proud cause his son is gettin' bigger
I took time to load the bullets, now I'm 'bout to pull the trigger
Like boom, boom, boom, I'm a genius, god dammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Skinny told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
Yeah, nd to my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname Starter-Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other lames is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like


[Hook: Rick Ross]
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack

Yes yes y'all

Get it off my chest y'all

[Verse 1: Drake]
Jealousy’s something I haven’t felt for years
There’s nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love but damn
They just need to enjoy it
Try and make it better instead of trying to destroy it
And look this ain't a rap that’s talking bout all the dough you spent
This the so, so, so the Soul Movement!

[Verse 2: Slakah The Beatchild]
My brothers and, and, my ladies
We gonna take it back, to the days when De La souled it
By way of Marvin Gaye and Stevie, Tribe Called Quest unfolded
We chilled laid back on the block, bumping CL and my nigga Pete Rock
SWV had me weak for real, I’m a make you feel so good (yeah)

[Bridge: Slakah The Beatchild]
So when the beat drops we hop onto the floor
And when the beat stops we start banging the walls
When the walls fall we gone’ take it outside
And party till the stars and the moon collide

[Chorus: Slakah The Beatchild]
Enjoy ya self, Enjoy ya self
Enjoy ya self, Enjoy ya self , Enjoy ya self

[Verse 3: Slakah The Beatchild]
My brothers and, and my ladies yeah oh
We need to take it back ‘cause now a days
There’s so much violence
That feel good real good vibe is gone
And it’s so hard to find it
Good times are gone and shattered
I thought that Family Matters
And it was A Different World
We were A-Team but now we’re scattered

[Bridge: Slakah The Beatchild]
So when the beat drops we hop onto the floor
And when the beat stops we start banging the walls
When the walls fall we gone’ take it outside
And party till the stars and the moon collide

[Chorus: Slakah The Beatchild]
Enjoy ya self, Enjoy ya self
Enjoy ya self, Enjoy ya self , Enjoy ya self

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Tell me why)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


[Verse 3: Drake]
Went from my nigga serving it by the tele to venues in Manchester
Just swerving with Balotelli the fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassing
They even bring up these niggas make a comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something
Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
Can't you talk to me?
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, tell me baby
Sometimes you are, all alone
But there's no doubt
So don't just shut me out
Cause that's not what love's about


[Chorus: Aaliyah]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge 2: Aaliyah]
Came too far to give up, gotta try
'Cause I can't do it on my own

[Intro:]
Yep...
Uh Huh
And then it comes to me, like an epiphany
(It's over, over
Yeah, It's over, over)

[Verse 1:]
Second night in a row
You didn't come home
I'm watching my phone
Waiting for it to ring (ring, ring)
Sitting in the house
On the couch with the TV on
All night, all alone
Every time, same old thing

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you been sleeping
(It's over) I'm leaving
(It's over) I'm leaving
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)


[Verse 2:]
So you walked in
The next morning
To find me smiling
Like nothing ever happened
You give me some excuse
Like you always do
I just kiss your cheek
And this is
What I tell you (you, you)

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you been sleeping
(It's over) I'm leaving
(It's over) I'm leaving
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge:]
How many times did
I fall for your lies?
How many times
Did I sit home and cry
Never questioning why, why
It just came to me
Like an epiphany
"How about if I just leave?"


[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you been sleeping
(It's over) I'm leaving
(It's over) I'm leaving
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Connor Shell:

You’re so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision, and that ultimate responsibility?

Drake:

Yeah, I mean, I think that for the last week and a half I’ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he’s in. I don’t think that there’s a better way to deal with it than how he just did. I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing, I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way, was courageous and was just, to me, I think it’s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation.

I’m just honored to know him and glad that I’ve gotten to, no pun intended, witness this moment for sure. I think it’s an incredible thing.  I actually woke up kind of late today, so I’m just catching on. It’s a great feeling for me. I can’t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he’s been a friend of mine for a long time.

Shell:

Obviously, you’ve joined Saturday Night Live and we’ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we’ve seen in the past?

Drake:

I think obviously one of the talents that I’m able to bring to the ESPYS is music, but I’m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music, but I’m not there to put on a strictly music‑based show. Yeah, we definitely have some incredible pre‑tapes. Yeah, I think it’s just going to be a great night overall. I’m there to deliver a great hosting job.

Shell:

What makes the perfect ESPYS host? We’ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer?

Drake:

Well, I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I’m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don’t know.


To me, it’s just about knowing the room that you’re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve.

Shell:

Hosting a sports awards show, what do you feel is music’s role in sports?

Drake:

Well I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they’re always super into music, whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I’ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league, so I think they’re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other, and I think that’s what really ties music and sports together.

Shell:

This is a question for the producer, and if possible I have a follow‑up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN, was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS? Did anybody reach out? Were you close?

Maura Mandt:

No, there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision, it wasn’t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS, I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year, and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective, and that’s what you look for the host for.

We’re going to be reflecting on the year, and LeBron is something that happened, so it will definitely be something that we’ll address in the show. But just like in sports, we don’t try to make that news happen. It unfolds.

Shell:

Drake, in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance, and a lot of times in hip‑hop that’s kind of also a part of rap music and it’s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage, whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip‑hop?

Drake:


I think that’s a funny question. I think it’s a good fit. I definitely think that hip‑hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we’re not trying to end people’s careers or make people feel bad in any way, and that’s kind of most of the time what problems in hip‑hop are about. So our night, like I said, is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports.

So, yeah, I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words, so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different.

Shell:

You’re also being aware of public perception. For instance, you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer, right, and you so like you definitely have, I don’t know how to put it, maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she’ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you’ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing? Everyone loved it, so can we expect that now that you’ll be hosting the ESPYS?

Drake:

Well, I obviously don’t want to give away the material. But I do have a growing affection for Skylar, and I’m not sure she’ll be able to make it, but I’m sure I’ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I’m sure, if I haven’t done it already, now that I know you’re looking for it, I might stick one in there, for sure. You never know.

Shell:

One of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build‑up.  Today, I don’t know if you realize this, but you’ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means?

Drake:

Well, as far as the latter end of the question, I’d rather not comment on it, but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That’s why I’m excited.

We’ve been working hard, like I said, on the pre‑tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night, which I can 100% guarantee it will.

Shell:

Is Cleveland your new favorite sports city? How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins, Manziel, and LB James into your ESPY segment?


Drake:

First of all, I’d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks, I do not team jump. I’ve been ‑‑ in the past, I’ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it’s the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer, whether it comes to football or obviously basketball, I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams.

So it’s not that I’m team jumping, I’m just a supportive friend. With the recent news, of course I’m going to go ‑‑ of course I’m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron, who like I said has been a brother to me for years, I mean, we’ve got three kids from Toronto on one team, plus we have Manziel who, again, is part of our family and like a brother.

So I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best.

But, yeah, like I said, my teams will always forever be who they are, but, yes, I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland, a place that I’ve been time and time again touring, I just think it’s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they’re just a supportive group of people, and it is a great place, so I’m really excited.

Shell:

So the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you’re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music? You have a lot to write about now that you’re a bachelor again.

Drake:

Well, actually, my status hasn’t changed, just to clear that up. I’ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that, the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something, I don’t let my focus stray.

So for Maura to give me this opportunity to host, I don’t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be ‑‑ to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show, and then from there, I have things coming up, whether it’s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne, which is a real thing, which a lot of people don’t know if it’s a real thing or not, but it’s very real and it’s going to be very competitive. And then from there, I’ll figure out the next steps for me.

I’m always working on new music, but the ESPYS is the main focus right now, and we’ll figure out what’s next afterwards.

Shell:

One thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you’re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne.  With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience, can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show?


Drake:

Yeah, I’m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance, and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character, especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So, yes, I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS, and they’re good. I’m excited.  They’re great.

Shell:

Are you bringing your lint roller?

Drake:

Oh, yes. I think I’ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn’t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in, maybe we would have used the joke. No, I think I’ll be lint‑free that night. I’ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit.

Shell:

So we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits, and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they’re going to wear?

Drake:

I’m not exactly sure what brands I’m going to be wearing. Right now I’m sort of still, like I said, very focused on the show. I’ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I’ll be wearing. But I’m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I’ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that’s really what my main focus is, but I’ll get my suits together.
I’m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won’t have to say anything.

Shell:

You have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven’t met yet that you’re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you’re with already given you any advice about hosting?

Drake:

Well, I mean, I’ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know, one of my mentors who is not an athlete, but obviously Jamie Foxx, a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this, just because that performance that he gave, I believe he hosted twice or three times, oh, twice, right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music, but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I’m looking forward to meeting?
I mean, yeah, I was going to say, I’ve never met Skylar. I’m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up, which she probably won’t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But, yeah, if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It’s been all in good spirits. But, yeah, that is the one person I’d like to meet.

Just for that last person, I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah, Nick whatever his name is, because he didn’t win, so that’s how he’s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is.

Shell:

Can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you, and how many are coming from the writing staff? Also, if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song?

Drake:

Oh, very good double question. Well, for the first part, the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that’s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We’ve been at it now for three months, I think, just on and off, meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine, I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I’m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music, jokes and pre‑taped pieces, I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it.

Is writing a joke harder than writing a song? I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest, raw emotion about my life, I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it’s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it.

But, yeah, I mean, all my music is so honest, that sometimes it’s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you’re able to be lighthearted and joke around, I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do.

Mandt:

I’d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years, one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it’s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we’ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what’s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life, it really elevates it, so it’s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved.

We had a shoot the other day from one of the skits, and on set he was coming up with stuff, and you guys will see it and know what I’m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session, and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I’m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.



[Verse 1]
KD, I know you're here, I know you understand me
Real talent doesn't always win championships
Like real music doesn't always win Grammy's
But we're okay...
Honorable mention works for me and you

He gets an honorable mention, hey
It ain't so bad being number two

[Verse 4]
Honorable mention
Honorable mention
Didn't win didn't lose

Every high-saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper, and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva

I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Young Moolah, baby


[Verse 1]
It could all be so simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving is you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me who I have to be
To get some rest and [?]
’Cause no one loves you more than me
No one ever will

[Chorus]
No matter how I think grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working, it ain't working
And when i try to walk away
You hide yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy

[Verse 2]
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
As painful as this thing has been
I just can’t be with no one else
You let go and I'll let go too
'Cause no one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will



[Chorus]
No matter how I think grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working, it ain't working
And when i try to walk away
You hide yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won’t you live for me?

Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you’d be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me


[Verse 3]
Everybody get your mothafuckin’ roll on
I know shorty and she doesn't want no slow song
Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I’ve been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First, last phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off but it's alright
And you showin' off but it's alright
It's a short life, yeah

[Chorus]
That's a real one in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
You really pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta, be nice for what, to these niggas?
I understand

[Verse 4]
You got a hunnid bands
You got a baby Benz, you got some bad friends
High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressin' off no lover in the past tense
You already had them
Work at 8 A.M., finish 'round five
Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same offline
You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off but it's alright
And you showin' off but it's alright
It's a short life


[Outro]
Where were you when I needed you?
Where were you when I needed you?
Where were you when I needed you?
Where were you when I needed you?



[Intro]
Damn V-O, sounds like you got a lot of niggas mad at you bruh. Guess that's what happens when uh, you a R&B Diva tryna live a rapper's life. You know what I'm saying. But um, if you really want it with me man I got you, I'mma show you what it is to get exposed, I hope I'm on key, hahaha

[Bridge]
The V-O-Y I'm talking to you
And both them record deals that ain't never go through
OK Voyce, we know you was a snitch
But you don't get your boys back like that
Still need a ride, you ain't gettin paid
And Taj got you at them shoots wearing pink shades
OK Voyce, always knew you a bitch
But I ain't know you got down like that

[Verse 1]
I hear you issuing threats, you need to kill the jive talk
Furthest thing from street bruh, that's why I call you sidewalk
We here waiting, if you stupid then try it
How you gon' knock me out lookin' like Snoop on a diet?
Uh, listen slim fast, we all know that
The only time that you raisin' up the shooters is in the gym class
This ain't dooms day, this today and after
This a diss track from your sister's favorite rapper

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah. Ho!
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance

[Hook: Drake]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change


[Hook: Drake x2]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'mma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own


[Hook: Drake x2]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Outro: Drake] (x2)
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh

Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh

[Intro: Father's Children]
Dirt and grime and filth inside

Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Perfect!)
Southside!

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Yo!)

[Verse 1]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (Yo!)
10 thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (Yo!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (Yo!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant


[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Sonic boom!)

[Verse 2]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
I give 'em grey poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for? Haaan?
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (Yo!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (Yo!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2, Timbuck2

[Intro: Drake]
Please

[Verse 1: Drake]
D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Something spinnin' fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room, cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian
It's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin' ahead (head)
Plus it's gettin' hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride y'all
We all of age and I ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb

[Chorus: Drake]
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin' me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded


[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
I just set the 40 ups, and I got two blunts
Bagging sour diesel, stinking like I got a few stumps
I’m sipping on lean, while you got fruit punch
Getting faded like clothes, I’ve been washed too much
Man, smoking with the devil got me high as an angel
Blow a smoke ring over my head, it’s a halo
Wake up, and bake up, spend the whole day slow
Head in the clouds, but my face low
Ayo, I got them percocets, you want a percocet?
Yo' girl got some nice titties, yeah, a perky set
I purchase cess ‘cause everyday I work with stress
High while I’m driving, it’s like I’m triyn’ to work a jet
And I smoke like a choo-choo train
So I stay low-key like Ja Rule new name
And I can barely walk, but it’s all good and dandy
Man, I’m so high I need a pilot to land me

[Chorus: Drake]
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin' me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded

[Verse 1: Drake]
Pay attention, its on
Staring at my city lights through the plane window as I write this song
Have faith, when I do it
I’ma do it bigger than they think
I dont just flow I over flow I be filling up the sink
Like I left the water on I run this bitch if anybody ask
Ain't much change since high school
Niggas still be in and out of class
S class or the brand new CL5 on them haters
Black paint, chrome trim same color as the logo for the raiders
I just said that cause I'm out in California in the studio with Tez
You should give us credit niggas killin people we can be all doin that instead..
But we not, we just kill the summer every single time I come around
Never chase hoes but we do we laugh at them niggas tryin to run em down
Not I, not me, YMOB, call jaz, call c
Bet both of them would agree
Get viewed, get judged, get booed, get loved
Shit get done round here, do you, not us

[Hook]
Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s what I’m given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds


[K-os]

Once upon a time I met
On this cold explosive dosage she wrote this
But tell me who chose this
Sin city’s innocent really when its inside my mind
And co-sign with a rhyme and a big pen
Once again it’s an even odd
Can’t applaud with one hand
Can’t be God with one fan
Or can you stan you
If not pastor jackson daniels rip that hit that
Now I sip that lightly when I’m on my mic tightly
And I write nightly like Spike Lee
Let me break it down

I been having a maid since the 8th grade with a fade
Rapping by the swings
And the bell never really rings
Class in session there’s no recession
For this upper echelon mic testing its
K-dash-O-S F-R-E-S-H in the place
With a grace in and outta space
Mind that gotta race
Don’t be something that you really not
Sabotage the universal plot
When the planet earth rock gets hot
From the sun don’t get got just get God yeah see that


(Do you believe)
[Hook]

[Chorus: Drake]
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?

On my way from the studio, so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text (Yeah)
I want to get straight to the climax (Straight, straight to the)
Yeah, have you coming all summer like a season pass (Yeah)
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back (Yeah)

(verse1)
I could tell you from experience
These bitches ain't loyal
Shit ain't been the same since
They treat me like I'm Royal
Doing every female dirty
Cause I haven't found the real one
She just wanna hang cause she never real fun
Like pimp c said this ain't 91
Stopped working for a boss when I became one

(pre hook)
You would think they feline these niggas acting pussy
You would think I'm the edge they way they push me
I gotta keep real, cause fakeness ain't me
You always keep it real, that what you promised me

(hook)
If I told you that I trust you
Would you go and break my trust
If I told you that I love you
Would you go and fuck it up
I know you someone's daughter
So Ima love you harder, girl
Faithful faithful faithful faithful

(verse 2)
You always accusing me but girl I wouldn't cheat
I been in the Stu working hard so im never in the street
Especially cause you look like a model
Ima finish up this song and go cop a bottle
Take off your clothes off the henny I got no patience
She a skinny girl but her ass jiggle when she naked
She didn't let me hit quick but I'm glad I waited
Fuck them other girls cause you my bitch and I'm glad to say it
I was the most hated for a long time
By the females who couldn't be mine
Yeah
But they know you my boo
I would never have you looking like a fool
Cause that's impossible
She smart she go to school

(Pre-hook)

And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
And until you do babe (don't you leave)
Ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Tonight I'll make sure (you cum before me)
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
But before you do (don't you leave)
It ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Make that sure you (cum before me)

Part 2: Make Sure

[Verse 5: dvsn]
Get you on top of me
We can do this still properly
Get your hands in the air, do your hair back
You're like a winning ticket off the lottery
But you don't, yeah, you don't want to start on me
Yeah, you don't want to start with me
But you should, keep shaking that in front of me
Unless you're down to do this publicly
You know, you know you gon' get comfortable
On the [?] rug with me
And I fuck with you
So if you really fuck with me
Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you
And she hit me with that "I don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions"
Let's see what's next then
And it makes so much sense now (I need you to cum)
Girl it makes so much sense now (told you to leave)
You know that I'm gon' make sure now (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure  (cum before me)
Make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)
Make sure, make sure (told you to leave)
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure  (cum before me)




[Verse 1: Drake]
Thought I’d never see the light of day
You can thank me later for the record
I don’t even need it right away
I just really need the right of way
So that I can lane switch
Trust anybody that I came with
They will be here when I ain't rich
I-I-I swear, I know, they are in the boat I row
E’rrybody in it gotta paddle, muthaf-cker won’t let go
I done made a hundred thousand dollars every season I was on that show
I’ve been told I was next by a legendary that was on Death Row
It’s a secret, I’ma tell ‘em, rappers only claiming they get paid
I’ve been gettin love in the club ever since a nigga came in underage
I just put Patron in the pineapple and I do the same with lemonade
Let my money flow through the air, I can make it rain on your parade
I can do it, I can do it and I know the rumours get around
I’ma take my city to the top and then I’ma never let ‘em down
I’ma show a lot of people love, I’ma give ‘em credit where it’s due
Anyone that got it I can do it, this the one I dedicate to you

[Hook: K-OS]
I’m gon do what I want
Cause this life’s made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
I’m gon do what I want
Cause this life’s what I’m given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds

[Verse 2 - K-OS]
Cardiac arrest rap tag
Wait a sec, wait a minute, I’ve been in it from beginning
Spinnin’ raps like my heart was a tape deck, yes
I’ve been on the block, freestyling, wylin’ while I was a yout’
Many wonder what the truth it, when the future’s like a tattoo
Gotta make haste while the sun shines
If you only live one time when the spaceships arrive from the skies
I’ll be flyin’, I’m not lyin’ I’m sublime in my alpah state
Let the heart palpitate
Let the soul just astroplane
Here’s a secret, let me tell ‘em
We’re the ones that started rock n roll
Jimi Hendrix, Little Richard, platform shoes and an afro comb
Me ET phone home, BET play my song
Had faith oh so long, thats why we both flowed on so
Ohhhhh, I’m like another message they sent on the bottle
Now people knooooooow…
’bout a freak of nature with a pen and paper
Can’t escape in the ether if you got faith, yeah
See that

[Hook]

[Intro]
Ari
Oh, yeah
Hey

[Chorus]
I brought four, five guns inside the club with me
Who gon' fuck with me?
I brought twenty bitches on the sprinter bus with me
Who gon' fuck today? Ha
My whole crew gon' fuck today
And I brought four, five guns inside the club with me
Who gon' fuck with me?
I brought twenty bitches on the sprinter bus with me
Who gon' fuck today? Ha
My whole crew gon' fuck today

[Verse]
I got in the club with a .30
Security ain't really search me
We a hundred deep on purpose
When they see us they get nervous
We just came to shut the club down
I started rap and put the drugs down
Call my nigga, he the plug now
I said call my nigga, he the plug now
He the plug now, haha (Turn up, turn up)
We take them pounds and stuff 'em in a rental
We fly to california and we send 'em
Say what you want, just tell me what you spendin'
I still will pull up and serve you out the window
I just made a play on the way to the shows
So it's fuck the show money, I ain't really trippin'
And I just caught a case 'cause I tried to go get on a plane
And forgot that I still had my pistol
Shoutout to my lawyer, I'm still on probation
So I'm tryin' to stay out the way, I be chillin'
A whole lot of fake niggas showin' fake love
But I ain't really bothered, I ain't really trippin'
A whole lot of gangsters be actin' like women
They get on the internet, typin' their feelings
When you see me out, just remember


[Chorus]
That I brought four, five guns inside the club with me
Who gon' fuck with me?
I brought twenty bitches on the sprinter bus with me
Who gon' fuck today? Ha
My whole crew gon' fuck today
And I brought four, five guns inside the club with me
Who gon' fuck with me?
I brought twenty bitches on the sprinter bus with me
Who gon' fuck today? Ha
My whole crew gon' fuck today

[Outro]
That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, it's Drake, KC

[Verse 1: Keshia Chanté]
We was just walking
Just smiling and talking
Then add to my surprise
Got lost in your eyes
This time they were different
And I found what it meant
After I leaned in I helplessly fell in

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love

[Verse 2: Keshia Chanté]
In love and I can't see
What's happening to me
You blinded my thoughts
From what pain and tears taught
See my hearts been broken before
It don't trust love anymore
One kiss from you
I just felt myself fall right through


[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love

[Verse 3: Keshia Chanté]
Got me hypnotized with your magic spell
I got butterflies, can't control myself
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you
It's true, don't know what to do

[Bridge: Keshia Chanté & Drake]
Don't stop now
Since I let you in
You showed me how
You showed me how to love again
And there's no reason why
I can't give you a try (you know what it is)
'Cause it feels so right

[Verse 4: Drake]
Look, previously mischievous behavior
Was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some considerable degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But ugh, Keshia, Keshia do you remember the old us?
We would never be together, is what they told us
From immature kids to entrepreneur kids
We bought our own dreams instead of the ones they sold us
Keep it a hundred, what they sayin' I'm a liar for?
Airing laundry, that's what I got a dryer for
What are they even searching through attire for?
Tellin' you these stories bout lonely women that I ignore
Callin' them out is red rover to me
To them it's a dream, its just a rare rover to me
See I'm passionate and focused
I don't know how they expect a Scorpio born in October to be, but ugh


[Alternate Verse: Drake]
I'm going in, check
Look, previously mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But now, I need a culprit
I am talking lofts and beach condo adult shit
I am talking all day shopping sprees at the mall with, friends that I ball with, here meet T's girl, go and get some fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise. I will kill this song until it actually dies
With a military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best until the stats arrive
And all these A-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside, its only slacks and ties
But you dont ever act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy until the plaques arrives
Thats why I love you

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
I've fallen please help me



[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
Can I, can I, save you from you?
Cause you know there's somethin' missin'
And the champagne that you been sippin'
Not supposed to make you different all the time
Starting to feel, like the wrong thing to do girl
Cause with all that recognition, it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

[Post-Hook: Drake & Jamie Foxx]
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
So who am I to judge you on the past girl?
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothin' like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me
Down right now, it's too late
I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, yeah, uh, look
Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober
Tellin' me how you movin' away and startin' over
Girl quit playin' you just drunk, you just sayin' shit
And oh you dance? Dance like how? Like ballet and shit?
Oh, wait, no I get it girl, I'm wit it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like ya second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothin' new except for someone new
But how you s'posed to find the one when anyone'll come with you?
Talkin' to myself but I never listened
Cause man it's been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'ma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested
Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it
And I fall

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

[Post-Hook: Drake & Jamie Foxx]
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you


Ughhhh…Los…uh-huhhh

Baby girl what's this about
Invite me in and kick me out
Theres better ways to deal with this
Does it offend you that I'm real as shit
Ain't another dude as tough you feel me
I mean who love you like I love you really
Whats up with this distancing
I dont feel significant
Hold up wait girl hold just a min
I need this moment just to vent
Incidents I can't control
Came up out I had to go
You knew I was coming back
You wanted that I had to grow
Said you could get past my past
So what we moving backwards for
Who knew it would take this long
You never mentioned that before
How could you diss me this me
Kiss me dismiss me just leave
Bitch we history mystery
Haunts me how you smile don't miss me
Want me need me call me
Deeply heal me hear me touch me see me feel me
See she guilty look away
Crooked love can't look my way
Took a day to write you this
For night you miss in light of this
Cuz I made it despite of this
Lets make a night of this
Fire lit glass of wine relax your mind we passin time
Ashes from the passions of our past just fly
And its fine
Damn it's time to accept it I never hear your voice again
Its so hard to say goodbye but thats what turns boys to men
The choices in
Life never seem fair
But they bring light to the things never seen there
So at least for the time that it took
When you climb and you look
You done made it to the clean air
Breathe in enjoy it cuz some seek joy just to destroy it
Distorted visions don't playback the way they were recorded
Why can't sometimes life be edited minus all the bullshit
Get a full grip fast forward through the open road
When life push your buttons you dont seem to have remote control
I hope that your soul is safe
I hope all your goals in place
I hope that it goes away and everything just goes your way
I hope when foes oppose you they get stuck with the frozen face
I hope I can motivate somebody to grow today
I hope that you go hard and even though things dont go your way
Hold up wait


Even though you broke my heart
I'm still wishing you the best
I'm just gonna play my part
If someone's willing to invest
This has been my blood
This has been my tears
This is been a pain I felt inside my heart for years
I been workin so hard I know they gotta feel the bars
This ain't bout no girl this bout the deal I lost

Yeaaa,ey yo check this out
I like to dedicate this song to…
All my failures in life
Everything that I ever endured that just made me stronger…
It made me realize that
It's not the end, it's not where it stops
Anybody could do it…LETS GO!!!

 



[Verse 1]
Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you been sipping
Not suppose to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do (yeah)
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from

[Hook]
I swear I always fall for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type (yeah oh uh oh)
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all (*4X*)
I believe in people like you

[Verse 2]
Cause who am I to judge you on the past girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uh look, dress hanging off your shoulder barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just sayin' shit
And you dance, dance all high, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait, no I get it
Girl I’m wit' it
I’ve been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn
I wonder why I never learn my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it’s the first impression
And I heard there’s nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it’s been a while and I swear that this one's different
That’s why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been
And I’m slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I’m just trying to correct it, and I fall

[Hook]


[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Dedication 6, of course
Shout out Guru for sendin' me the beat, too
Young Angel, Young Lion
More Life, no dyin'
Yeah, alright, I got it, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Super Bowl goals, I'm at the crib with Puff
He got Kaepernick on the phone, he in a whole different mode
Angel hair at 2AM for Bey and Hov
Just to show 'em how I treat the city like my humble abode
Ayy, tell me if TD Bank is approvin' loans
I'm thinkin' of payin' Wayne what Universal owes
My nigga spent a lifetime goin' platinum and gold
He should own half of the label, shit outta control
Somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need some ownership if we pressin' go
'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like "A Milli" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas
I make the crib, expandin' pools and expandin' rooms
Addin' Hammam Spas with tannin' booths, nigga
That's truth, no boost, nigga
But this isn't all about callin' truce
I'm still dishin' out verbal abuse
That shit could get re-introduced
If somebody got somethin' they urgin' to prove, nigga
Inspirin' to the youth
New Years Eve, lookin' like a royal flush
Wait, we all in the same suit
I'm Hall of Fame in the booth, nigga
My karma makin' the news, nigga
This pudding taste like the proof, nigga
If I ever see Trump, he better salute niggas
Much as we do, nigga, for real


[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Six shit

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I could care less 'bout your squad, I don't connect when I'm flyin'
I'm on a jet and it's mine, I just hope the weather is fine
I took the jet to Dubai, I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet way to Africa, shout out my nigga Akon
Your bitch sweatin' my squad, please get the sweat out her eye
I put the dick in her spine, I fucked the bitch in her prime
Don't get my credit declined, give all the credit to Moms
I flipped the bird at the Bird – hey, what's for dinner? Popeyes
These chickens got bird flu, and they chirp, chirp too
Always sung, never flew, these boys Hot Girls too
If money grow on trees, I climb and rest in that bitch
Build a treehouse and knock the bird nest out that bitch
Stuck my neck out and shit, then got the heck out that shit
And when I did, I took the special effect out of that shit
Tunechi F 'round this bitch
The best thing left 'round this bitch
All you niggas some bitches, I feel like Hef 'round this bitch
You call her Stephanie, I call her Steph 'round this bitch
Now back to whippin' the baby on some step mama shit
I come direct with my shit, I come correct with my shit
A blank check on your face, put some respek on my shit
Branches startin' to shake, here comes the leaves, get the rake
I want my piece of the cake, it should be sweeter than cake
Here come the leaves, get the rake, and we ain't leavin' the rake
We made the cleanest escape, although I bleeped in your face
You playin' wit the right one today
Your flag is a white one today
You wearin' em tight ones today
Check me or write one today
You playin' with fire today
The Angel and Lion are greats
Oh my God, lightning strikin' twice in this place
Should we make a wish or should we make it right in this place?
All this motherfuckin' beef, I need some rice on this plate
Talked to your wifey today, she feelin' triflin' she say
Talked to the sniper, he say he aimin' at diapers today
Pick you off like pickin' peppers, Peter Piper today
So tell your squad I say "BLAOW" like Spice 1 would say
It's Mortal Kombat tonight, it's Street Fighter today
I'm Major Bison, Drizzy lit like Raiden light up the place
You see blue face hundreds 'til you white in the face
Oh my God, it feel like I done life in this place
But swear to God, I got money doin' life in my safe
Put on the gloves like MJ, go from OG to OJ
I make you pay attention then rip your receipt in your face
This for Cita and Nae, this for my people and bae
I got three sons of a gun, them niggas keep me on safe
Hol' up, I am the black god to the church
I am the fat boy to dessert
I am the landlord to the first, got two bangers
One of them go "bada boom," one of them go "bada bing"
I taught these hoes how to love, I taught these boys how to lean
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle
The eyes don't lie 'til you blink 'em
Keep the iron for the wrinkles
The mansion came with the sprinklers
I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
Yeah, you know life is a movie, you niggas playin' yourselves, damn


[Outro: Lil Wayne]
That's some six shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
It's every man for themselves, it's every baby for sale
And you know life is a movie, you niggas ratin' yourself
I just hope it’s a porn to watch you pussies play with yourself
That's some six shit

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
Go, go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
Go, go, go, go, go, go 'head
Go, go, go, go, go, go 'head

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did ('Sup, girl)
Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Well, aren't you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, figure they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like “Voilà!” You do it right he just might buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, triple-white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did

Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?

Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Interlude: Drake & Swizz Beatz]
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands (Yeah)
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends

Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends

Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Showtime)
Go, go, go, go, go (As we proceed)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did

A go, go, go, go, go, a go 'head
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?

Nails done, hair done, everything big (Oh)
All my LA girls, let me see your hands (Ayy)
New year's eve you can leave up and bring a friend
And she bought it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done, hair done, nails done, hair done

All my LA girls (All my LA girls)
All my LA girls (All my LA girls)
All my LA girls
Let 'em know that everything big (All my LA girls)
Nails done, hair done, nails done, hair done


[Verse: Drake]
Finally back in Toronto, it's better here
I just wanna be anywhere but everywhere
I'm being lazy at the crib kushin' it up
I get enough exercise just pushing my luck
Sitting back thinking, damn, where did they go?
They used to be the ones to watch Ricki Lake show
And now I see 'em picking up the pieces
One too many starting over speeches
I guess, it’s back to me like it always was
Me and the OVO set like it always was
A little money on the counter I left for my girl
With a note I’m trying to see the rest of the world
It all looked so amazing when we are growing up
Used to sit back and say I know I’ll get a model one day
But all the money and the rap game slow as fuck
And all the models from the hood, Project Runway
Yeah, it’s whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
But it’s evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you just gotta cherish
Like this young girl had my lyrics tatted on her arm last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I been here before, huh?
Yeah, I still got ten years to go, huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright


[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Drake]
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? (You gotcha)
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Na-na-nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? (You gotcha)
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Na-na-nails done, hair done, everything did (Oh)
Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Outro: Drake]
All my LA girls
This go out to all my LA girls
I said, all my LA girls
Happy new year

Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, every thing big
Nails done, hair done, everything big

[Verse 1: Drake]
You gettin' ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spendin' hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you’re the fuckin' coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together


[Hook: Swizz Beatz x2]

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
She got it all together
She dont need to help none
She got her own paper
She dont need you to taker her
On a shopping spreee
My girl is fancy, fly and free
For some Gucci, huh
For some Louis huh
She got the best of everything
You can never report a fancy girl like me

[Hook: Swizz Beatz x2]

[Verse 1:PARTYNEXTDOOR ]
Call it five, yeah
Still alive, yeah
Said you ain't good enough
You'd be surprised yeah
**Fantasy

It can't be rid of me**
Here for the paper, the green
The hater come in, we just ??
Took your lies
I'm not surprised
We just too god for the game
Whatever you feel is the same
Most of theses niggas the same
We bring the difference
Teaching these clowns
Mess up the game
Keeping my sound
No one else around, yeah
We keeping my sound

**Fantasy

It can't be rid of me**

We keeping my sound

**Fantasy
Its just fantasy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Big up to yourself, baby don;t you ever quit it
Baby, not a lot of options for you
I will admit it
Something so cultural
But I never see the culture take control of you
Always had a grasp of your past and your present
Never looked away from the people thata helped you get it
Helped you understand that is bigger than you
And all your mentions
Or anyting that''s pending  that you sending to all these wenches
Girl counting your blessings
Look
Your dreams are something worth capturing
Always out at night
When them kickbacks are happenin'
I need you to work hard,  kick backin'...
Just keep relaxing
The graduating,come larrrrd
Your the princess of a king
The definition of father
The daughter of a queen
Who would never touch the bottom
Had to serve another to know what it's like to hunger
I wonder about if your 1st or 2nd meal is comin'
See times are really hard
When you haven;t got it figured out
But God's gonna see it thru
As long as you don't have any doubt
'Cause nothin' will be given
If you have nothin' to bless B
She had a man that did her wrong
That's on to the next B
She don't need a man to make her feel good
She always had a sense of self
You'd be so impressed
She carries body positivity  and loves her self
Please don't  stop her from getting what she deserves
The best me

[Refrain]
**Fantasy
Its just fantasy
It can't be rid of me**

[Intro: Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir & Future]
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
Oh, oh, oh, father...
(If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi & Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir]
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

[Chorus: Kanye West & Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir]
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands


[Verse: Kanye West & Kelly Price]
Now, if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'ma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'
I'd be worried if they said nothin'
Remind me where I know you from
She lookin' like she owe you some'n
You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my...
I wanna wake up with you in my...

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi, Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir & Kelly Price]
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin'
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I stretch my hands


[Chorus: Kanye West & Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir]
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands



[Intro]
This is why I do this shit
I think they call this "venting"

[Verse 1]
Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 2]
(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 3]
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me


[Intro: Usher, DJ Khaled & Young Jeezy]
DJ Khaled (DJ Khaled!) (yeah!)
Oh oh (the streets is fed up)

Check in the game now I'm back in the light, yeah

I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I am absolutely, positively on my grizzy
Even though I'm sick and I'm tired, I gets busy
Started a 62, but it ended up a frisbee
And me, I like to stand at the stove until I'm dizzy
Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me
Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me
'Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me
(I'm fed up, I'm fed up)
I give it all up before I let the fame get me
I got niggas tryin' to sue me, bitches tryin' to do me
Way these niggas actin', you'da thought they never knew me
But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me
I'm fed up, it's why I'm actin' like the old me


[Hook: Usher]
Yeah, yeah
It was all a dream, yeah homie I am on my job
And you can't take that away from me
Yeah I got my team, and I got all of my niggas behind me

I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm sick and tired of you suckers so now I'm fed up
Somebody catch the chain, I'm 'bout to tear his head off
Shawty bendin' over knowin' I'm 'bout to tear it up
Before you let your top back, get your bread up
Made history, but now we claimin' victory
Get ya out the White House, go back to your efficiencies
Suckers feel me and I know you haters hear me
(I'm fed up, I'm fed up)
Like the IRS, you wonder what I'm makin, yearly!
With them brown bags circulate, so I perpetrate
We shinin' than the bottom cause we're down to twerkulate
Lookin' at the parking lot; better get your mind right
I hope you fed up being broke because the times right
Ross!


[Hook: Usher]
Yeah, yeah
It was all a dream, yeah homie I am on my job
And you can't take that away from me
Yeah I got my team, and I got all of my niggas behind me
And they give me the love I need (yeah)

Check in the game now I'm back in the light, yeah
I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up (hey) I'm fed up
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uhh, me and Wayne was gettin' high on 'em
He leaned over and told me, "Just don't retire on 'em
And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on 'em
And when they love you to death, just never die on 'em"
And the question still remains
Have I counted all the money that I've managed to obtain?
Niggas dedicatin' overtime to damagin' my name
And somehow I'm still the hottest motherfucker in the game

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
(I’m happy to be back man!) I’m tired of these haters
That’s why I go hard like A.C. Slater
Weezy Baby here, y’all pre-natal
I just get the beat and murk it out like Fredo
Uhh, I’m sick of bein' criticized
That’s why I’m higher than the Star Trek Enterprise
I do it big, don’t get mad cause you minimized
I keep a red flag in case I get penalized
Uhh, it's Young Money like you didn’t know
Stop playin', I hit Drizzy with the give-and-go
It was all a dream, now we the dream team
Who trying to see us? You seein' things
Hustle like I still pay rent man
Got a chest full of heart, no Tin Man
Uhh, Kha-Kha-Khaled I’m fed up
Flow wake the dead up, Weezy


[Verse 5: Usher]
Yeah, hop out, I been in this, been breakin records since '94
So I ain't gotta brag about records that I’ve broke
Records that I hold and records that I’ve sold
And I’m fed up with these niggas relieving my lingo (yeah)
Don’t bite the hand of your provider
You sayin' I ain’t influenced you, you a liar
I’m on fire, you just a biter
You need to wake up and realize

[Hook: Usher]
Yeah, yeah
It was all a dream, yeah homie I am on my job

I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Intro]
Damn, I thought I had it all figured it out
Especially when it came to relationships and girls
But just when I least expected it
Love, rearranged my whole world

[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Junior high, played 'em, high school, played 'em
College, well, you know, played 'em
Me and my friends used to laugh about it, how we fade 'em
Now cupid’s aiming his arrow right there at me
No more nonchalant can I be, with you here staring at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever see
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what I'm feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it

(J. Cole, baby bro, speak)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Not so fast, Cole got a whole lotta lotto cash
Life of a bachelor, light skinned rapper
Found a top model with a Tahoe ass
With a broad so bad, when she cross your path
You get her outta them jeans you be thinking about rings
Okay she done got your ass
Cupid done shot your ass
But I'm trying to be a G though
So yeah, I'm gonna holler, yeah I'm gonna call her
But I ain't got a leash though
Uh, I put a name on a lease though
Get an extra set of my keys for
I think I might wife it now
But life is foul and you don’t got a free throw
Uh, and so my next move gon' have to be my best move
Beside every king is a bad ass queen
So girl let's make this chess move


[Hook: Sean Garrett]
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what I'm feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it

[Verse 3: Sean Garrett]
Now baby, baby
You doin' things with my heart ain't never felt, its so crazy
I agree to acknowledge love if you gonna let it change me
I was so mistaken
Your love like a Bentley coupe, took me out of a Mercedes
Now baby baby, for so long I miss somebody
My heart just couldn’t played with it
I went from not wanting a girlfriend to needing ya lady
I didn’t think I'd ever see
Me callin' to you, you voice before I go to sleep

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what I'm feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it

[Verse 4: Sean Garrett]
I ain’t never looked into a woman’s eye worth of fire
Bet I’m feelin' while you holdin’ me begging to take you higher
For so long I wasn’t faded, I couldn’t admitted before
But now I see what life’s about, and I’m never goin’ let you go
Girl I’m growin’
(Don’t wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable)
I see us growing
(Don’t wanna miss out on a feeling I ain't never had before)
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you done done to me, I gotta let ’em know


[Hook: Sean Garrett]
For the first time I’m in love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody what I'm feeling
Said for the first time I feel love, and I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody to feel it

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
I’d swore I’d never fall, but I fell
Run and tell all my old hoes
Erase my number, my photos
Uh, baby girl pardon me but
Don’t text, stop calling me
I ain't your nigga, don’t bother me
Fuck your Twitter, don’t follow me
My new girl too thorough
Believe it or not, man, she’s all I need
Thought I was a player, R.I.P
Down goes Frazier, call Ali
Let's hit the mall and its all on me
Cause girl you deserve it
If I take this chance and make these plans
I gotta know girl is you worth it? Perfect



[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Junior high, played 'em
High school, played 'em
College, well, you know, played 'em
Me and my friends used to laugh about it, how we fade 'em
Now cupid’s aiming his arrow right there at me
No more nonchalance can I be, with you here starring at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever seen
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries

[Chorus: Sean Garrett & Drake]
For the first time I’m in love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody (what im feeling)
For the first time I feel love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody
Drizzy Drake

[Verse 2: Drake]
All them men before me did shit I would never do
And I know you got your guards up, but they should let him through
Just keep fightin' for our lovin' baby, I'll defend it too
And if they try and tell me time is money I'd spend it with you
I spend it all
I spend it all
I charge forever, to my card
And pay it off, no interest lost
I be right here, and like your favorite wine girl
I'm worth trying, but take it easy on me
Cuz this my first time

[Chorus: Sean Garrett]
For the first time I’m in love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody (what im feeling)
For the first time I feel love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody

[Verse 3: Sean Garrett]
I ain’t never looked into a woman’s eye worth of fire
Bet I’m feelin' while you holdin’ me begging to take you higher
For so long I wasn’t faded, I couldn’t admitted before
But now I see what life’s about, and i’m never goin’ let you go
Girl I’m growin’ don’t wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable
I see us growing don’t wanna miss out on a feeling I never had before
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you'd have done to me, I gotta let ’em know

[Chorus: Sean Garrett]
For the first time I’m in love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody (what im feeling)
For the first time I feel love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody




[Verse]
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Chorus]
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

[Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say

[Verse 1]
I should be downtown, trippin on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is this that got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinions on me
I was only gone for the last two months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Hook]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I can do
But that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're throwing dirt on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

[Post-Hook]
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
Cause you don't mean them anyway
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

[Verse 2]
We need to breathe
There's more to life than hearing stuff and being mean to me
We had to let go of us to show ourselves what we can be
But that just didn't sit well with me
Tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Throwing dirt on my name, in public
You don't feel no way, on purpose
I'm messing up all of Drake's words, on purpose.. careful
Careful
Be careful
Be careful
You could never be too careful

(I'm not a singer but BBC got me up very early in the morning)

[Verse 3]
Keep ya head away from windows
Keep your arms inside the ride
Trust me with ya body, trust me with ya life
Banging on the windows, baby come inside
Certainly in trouble, maybe you should hide
I'mma tell you like
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today

[Outro]
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way
Feel a way, feel a way, young parents feel this way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way

...Social Experiment




[Intro: T-Streets]
What it do, nigga
This your nigga T-Streets
Bang-bang in the building
This Young Money
First up, my nigga Gudda Gudda
Double G, blap, blap

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
They call me Young Gudda, I'm all about the dough still
And anybody in my way: roadkill
Everything my hands touch turn to gold
Money, knots, and jewels with no records sold, yeah
I'm manhandlin' rappers with no effort
So imagine what'll happen when I start applyin' pressure
Guillotine flow, who ready to get severed, nigga?
In or out the booth, you could get leveled, nigga

[Transition: T-Streets]
Now we gonna take it to Harlem, Millzy

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
L’eggo! Yo, we are Young Money (Yes)
Nigga, your camp chocha
It's ‘bout to get real ugly—Omarosa
YM vultures, it ain't a family doper
We done changed the way the game look—Sammy Sosa (Ha!)
This is life, this ain't a job
The Audemars and Chapard just symbolize I go hard
Navy on Navy Camaro, I did it all for the Yankees (L'eggo)
Did it all for New York and this love, no need to thank me
Millz!

[Transition: T-Streets]
Now we gonna take to the West Coast
Tyga-Tyga

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Ugh, fast money, I don't slow dance
Young Money, motherfucker, 'til the world end
Money overweight, bitch—Roseanne
I don't listen to these kids—grown man
Skinny nigga, dope though, ugh, Lohan
Lindsey, the white Benz, same color Mike skin
Make your soul spin when the ping loading
Au revoir, goodbye, now applaud

[Transition: T-Streets]
Yeah, now it’s child’s play, nigga
My lil' G, Lil' Chuckee

[Verse 4: Lil Chuckee]
Young Money lil' G, battle juice in my blood
Jumpin' at the boy, man, you better have your bungee cord
Since Wayne took me off the leash, I ain't lose a fight yet
Now, come drag your dog out the ring, how you love that?
Young with an attitude, watch how you talk to me
Keep playin' Freddy, boy, I'll leak on your Elm Street
Trouble is what you want, dog, pain is what you don't get
It's Young Money to the bone gristle, you dig?

[Transition: T-Streets]
Now we got the hottest nigga on the internet
Lil' Twist Hefner, what it do?

[Verse 5: Lil Twist]
Ugh! Young Money, good night
And yeah, I'm gon' shine like a ultraviolet light
Lil' Twist gonna sell out like it's opening tonight
Going for the fist nigga to write
You need a telescope sight to try to see me, I'm so far gone
Even though I'm going off, kids, I'm so far on
I got a house full of chicks like the Playboy home
Wrappin' up my lifestyle and I smashed this song, Twizzy

[Transition: T-Streets]
Yeah, next up, we got the best rapstress alive, Nicki Minaj

[Verse 6: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in that cotton-pickin' Bent, put massa on the guts
White on white whips, Kunta Kinte on the clutch
You at the bottom of the pole—totem
Like Lamar Odom, I ball—scrotum
Flyer than a cricket so they call me "Nicki Jiminy"
And it's going down like Santa in the chim-i-ney
You don't ball, break your baby-back ribs
You need more assist than the handicapped kids
Oh, shit

[Transition: T-Streets]
And now, the beautiful Miss Shanell

[Verse 7: Shanell]
Young Money, we’re rockstars
So fuck with your Magnum on
And hold on, we go long
You feel that, we get that
We in that, we run that
We bust back
We hit them and we see them comin' back for more
Back for more

[Transition: T-Streets]
Next up, my nigga Mack Maine
Stupid Mack-nupid, one hundred

[Verse 8: Mack Maine]
Microwave family in the building, you can't hold us
Me, Tez, and Wayne, we the three new moguls
Buffet around here, y'all boys scrape the plates
And we don't eat up in our whips, but they got paper plates
Soon as we leave the club, damn, where the models go
One word I forgot to say on his album: "Hollygrove!"
This track is the finale, nah, this the genesis
Young Money murderers, we killin' shit, forever

[Transition: T-Streets]
Toronto
Drizzy
Get ‘em

[Verse 9: Drake]
Alright, I got this, you can never get this
I built it up from nothing, you would think I'm playin' Tetris
Thousand-dollar sweater on, but I don’t never sweat shit
Swear the beats they give me got a motherfuckin’ death wish
Yeah, tell me, who controls kings?
I don't follow rules, stupid old things
I'm flyin' through the city in a coupe with those wings
And my team deserves some motherfuckin' Super Bowl rings
Young Money

[Transition: Crowd]
Wee-zy! Wee-zy! Wee-zy! Wee-zy!

[Verse 10: Lil Wayne]
I'm so in this bitch, CEO in this bitch
Lil Weezy stand tall, tippy-toe in this bitch
Blood Gang, motherfucker, da-da-doe in this bitch
Make your girl get Barry Mani-low in this bitch
In the body of the world, money is the blood
And every day, I be back and forward to the blood bank
Ugh, makin' deposits 'til I fucking faint
New Orleans, nigga: How 'bout them fucking Saints?
It's tight on our end, call that "Bubba Franks"
Matter-fact, it's too tight—add a couple links
I'm the bar’s tender, you a woman drink
Yeah, it's Young Money, but the money ain't
Gudda tough, 'Nelly nice, Nick' nasty
Streets bad, Tyga ill, Drake magic
Millz Harlem, Chuck wild, Twist Dallas
And Mack Maine rap, sing and manage, ugh!

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
It's Young Mula, baby!


[Verse 1]
Yeah, I never really
Talk about dick that I wanna give you or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, hair grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like, like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin' (Kshh!)
Soothin', keep it right there, no movin'
Make my way around the bases-es
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (Hi)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now


[Interlude]
Did somebody…
Who'd they say that baby look like?
Drake!

[Verse 2]
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it, yeah



[Verse 1]
I'm more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart (Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 2]
I'm more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another (Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember and—

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 3]
It's more than just a mission (Hey, hey, hey)
You hear, but you don't listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (Hey, hey, hey)
And get what you've been missing

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Bridge]
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart


[Intro]
Yeah, wow
They not ready for my new shit
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week was more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in one room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all oooo–
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time (oooo)

[Chorus]
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind


[Verse 2]
You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things would get canceled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this

[Chorus]
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

[Outro]
You stay on my mind (stay)
Stay on my mind
Baby, you stay on
Baby, you stay on
Baby, you stay on
You stay on
Baby, you stay
On my mind, stay on my mind
On my mind, stay on my mind
You st–
On my mind, stay on my mind

[Verse 1]
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high

Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all

[Chorus]
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

[Intro]
Yeah, turn everything up
Yeah, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Turn everything up a little more

[Verse 1]
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside

[Intro]
Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate to you

[Verse 1]
They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna ride, fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back and never on the side, uh
(Yeah)

[Chorus 1]
You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it


[Verse 2]
Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me? I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided, tell me how you feel inside

[Chorus 2]
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 3]
Yeah-yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, "A guarantee"
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive


[Chorus 1]
But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Outro]
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my voice
This song's for you



[Intro: Drake & Charlie Sloth]
Yeah
I been waiting on this one Charlie, for real
I've been waitin' Driz
I've been waitin', let's get 'em bro
Nah, for real
Shout out Boi-1da too
Mm, I like that
Let's get 'em Driz
You don't have a drink, you're not drinking or what?
I got a drink bro
Hahahaha, I like that
I got my drink right here. Cheers my bro
Toast up man
Yeah, okay, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Goldman Sachs, they wanna hold my racks
Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he the expert
I hear it in they tone when they address him
We way too connected
Tom Ford assistant texted asking if I want classic or double breasted
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories of how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier
I told you
You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never rushin'
My niggas really made somethin' from nothin'
Dodge sentences like they don't wanna discuss it, change subject
Got the Benny Yang chains rubbin', never tucked in
Waiting to inhale
Things that I own will sell at auction as proof we did well
My house museum-scale
The only skeletons here are the ones from the nights I raised hell
Make sure the staff are paid well
Make 'em think twice 'bout the stories that they tell
No one knows when the plan is hatchin'
I'ma let 'em walk on eggshells
Tiptoe, niggas better know

[Interlude: Drake & Charlie Sloth]
Wow, man like Drizzy Drake!
Yeah
Got his foot on your neck man
What time is it? What time is it? It's like two in the morning right now
Yeah, well it's real late over here
It's me and Charlie, that's it, you hear me? We got the whole building to ourselves
We got the building. Kill them again, kill them again Driz, kill them!

[Verse 2: Drake]
Y'all keepin' the score while watchin' me score
Y'all keep the awards, I'll take the rewards
If y'all goin' for fun, I'll stay and record
But if y'all goin' to war I'm there for sure
Wouldn't miss it
I'm living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors soundin' like New Edition
That's these guys
Us guys don't wear New Balance or Levi's
Key West retirement plan
Grippin' the Callaway club in my hand
Hittin' balls off of the balcony into the sand
Tryna see where they land
October Firm the new chain of command
El chico, this verse is the explanation for the large ego
100 mill' hands free like Ronaldinho
I go from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Take your pick, Brooke or Tanya
Both those shorties'd leave their GPS on so I can find ya
Drop location
Spring break trips, I'm in hot rotation
I took a lot of my brothers from B and E licks or the pot rotation
To ridin' shotgun in a Picasso painting
Tricks up sleeves, have 'em playin' innocent to get the shits I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and this I see
Before I ever seen this shit tatted on P and tatted on C and tatted on me
I speak truth and get to shatterin' dreams
So it's best to tiptoe, niggas better know, yeah

[Outro: Drake & Charlie Sloth]
Drizzy Drake! You're an animal Drake! You already know that you an animal bruh! Animal!
I'm saucy!
Saucy! You just stepped out of the club straight into the booth like it's light. Tear up the ting in one take!
Showed up for you, you know what I'm sayin'?
My brother Drizzy
My brother, you already know
Wow. And you know what it's like. You stepped out the club into the booth to prove to everyone why you number one bro. Why you got your foot on their necks!
Nah for real. I stepped in here, SN1, OVO, Fire in the Booth, Charlie Sloth. Come on. The official. I rock with the official. I'm on official ting, you know what it is man. Come on, come on
Ayy bro, it feels like that's another moment there, you know what? Like, I got to say this to you on the real bro. The way that you've embraced British culture will be remembered forever. And the UK love you. The real G's over here, you know that bro. When you go to your parties, you see who's in your parties
Nah, you know what it is, of course
It's the certies
Nah, listen, but listen. It's a family and it's a big family, you know what it is. I'm just happy to be home, like I said man
My brother, man. Foot on neck time
Yo, are these guys dumb? You see the big man Charlie too, oh my goodness
My brother Drizzy. I can hear these rappers' prayers man
Nah, I'm heated for you right now
They're like, "Yo, please tell Drizzy to take his foot off my neck!"
Nah, I'm heated right now man, oh my goodness. Shout out French Montana, my brother, you know what I'm sayin'? The big wave, yeah. Shout out Huncho, Quavo. Shout out Offset, blessings on the new ting. Oh my goodness. Shout out, yo–. I could go for hours. Charlie, come on man
Ayy, you could go for hours. I was at your party the other night, I've seen who was there. I'm like, "Woah!" There's a lot of people, there was a lot of faces in that party
Nah, I don't wanna hear no chat for the whole 18 about Charlie Sloth. Are you dumb? Alright. Jheeze, jheeze
And that right there: one take. A real moment right there
Yeah, jhee!
And that's Fire in the Booth my guy!
And I'll be back January-February part two, you know what time it is. Come on!
Okay, okay
Shout out all the G's too, man. Shout out all the artists man. Everybody from here doin' their thing. I'm telling you. Big inspiration. London, England, come on man
Come on! You know I've applied for your passport, right?
Hahaha. I need that




[Verse 1: Drake]
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 3: Drake]
Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a don’t-a don't exist
Girl, I know you want this
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Uh)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Uh)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast


[Chorus: 2 Chainz, Drake & Both (A$AP Rocky)]

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches


[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back


[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh


[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane



[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shit, nigga, this what I does
I sware I ain't lyon, like this is my cubs
This is my tub, and I'm dirty in the summer, bitch
Weezy F Baby, and I lookin like I does some shit
You ain't know nothin bitch, you better know who you fuckin with
Try to fuck me, I kill you, and who you comin with
No homo, T, I had to go stupid
I'm on the high heels, but I am no Boosie
Hollands Avenue, ridin; with the roof gone
On the Mayback, 2 tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24's, boy, what you on
I'm richer than a bitch without the gray coupon
I'm talkin' out of my head, I make a blue eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a Blood, motherfucker, a Blood, motherfucker
Forever, like ETC period, motherfucker

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm so unsigned, it would blow one's mind
Cause every single record I am so unkind
There is no holes bard, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know rugs cost
So PAY UP, I don't think you will ever find another nigga like me
Never LIE, I got everything I tell them I got
This young nigga show boat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Who else tryna' smoke, yeah nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the Pressure, that's what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a Ski-do
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down, hoe, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm going in, like a life sentence
And understand, I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that, 10 4

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
Kidd Kidd!
Put on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit
Make a plumber throw his plunger, I can't deal with this shit, uh
You say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch, I'm back on my shit, like a fly
Since you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly (ha)
Like Pooky, take a Dooky on a rap producer, loose leaf
Throw his trash ass out the window like Lukey
To a shark, you just sushi
You ain't hard, you coochie
Wally Oochie, soft as newborn booty
I say I'm movin slow, I'm just thinkin fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, about to lap your ass
And nigga, I don't rest, I'm up, till my times up
I be the tech chef, all my beef prime cut
This ain't chorus lines, nigga, your choruses lyon
Cause the only point you ever gained, was a one

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man




[Chorus: Drake]

And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur "to the top"
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke, this cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know, rap will never be same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains who stand inside of a booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up outta of our mouths
Now rewind it
Pay back mothafucka for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man




[Intro: DJ Khaled & Complexion]
Would you fuck me for free?
Another one (Another one, another one)
We the Best Music! (Music, music) Major Key! (Major Key)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last two-hundred twenty-three thousand hours
And it's 'cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na-na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat-flat
And your ass on "What's that?"
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl, not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her— man

[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to—

[Verse 2: Drake]
Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl, you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah, I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood, I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet?

[Chorus: Drake & Complexion]
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to—
Would you fuck me for free?

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Another one (Another one)
They don't want me to have another anthem
So I made sure I got another anthem (Another anthem)
It's We The Best OVO
Summer's ours
It always has been
Don't ever play yourself (Haha, haha)
One time for Future the Prince
One time for 40
One time for Drake
Yeah, another one
Bless up


Lo



[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Room full of beautiful women but I want one
Room full of women and they notice me
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci
Freak in you (freak in you)
Freak in you (freak in you)
Is there a freak in you? (Freak in you)

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Come and talk to me, oh
Quick, rush, rush, rush
Baby, just like Kimora Lee, oh
So pretty, girl, you belong in a gallery
What's your fantasy? (Your fantasy?)
Say something you ain't never did (ain't never did)
Like fuck and suck a real nigga

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm flickin' my wrist like I'm a fisher
Diamonds on my chest like a bishop
And these lines right here ain't no pickup
These lines right here gon' really, really make you fuck
These lines really gonna make you numb like Chuck
This time is your time
I need to know if you're down
'Cause if not, I know there's more around

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
(There's always more)
There's always more, that’s for sure
There's always more, that’s for sure

[Interlude: Drake]
Yeah
I can't have the tissue before you sneeze, y'know
I can't bow down at your feet, y'know
Uh huh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon, I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote Take Care, but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, juss know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I'm just more ready than...
Yeah, yeah
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, juss know
Yeah
You don't wanna question it, you just want definite
Yeah, I jump out of relationships before I get left in it
Yeah, the sex we have reminds me of the money and success a bit
Yeah, 'cause even when I got it I just gotta keep getting it
Even when I got it I just gotta keep getting it
Big hotel suite, I'm the only one in it
Always going back to some shit that I already been in
Plenty fish up in the sea but I never go fishing
We got everybody sick, sending "get well soons" and a lot of well wishes
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, juss know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all clone
I'm just more ready than...
Yeah
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, juss know




[Intro: Nai Palm & Drake]
Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
You'll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

[Chorus: Drake]
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
Where you at? I never see you

[Chorus: Drake]
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

[Verse 3: Drake]
Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It’s bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me, "Pay it no mind"
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die

[Chorus: Drake]
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

[Verse 4: Drake]
Hidden Hills where I post, yeah
'Ye already know, yeah
I'm the troublemaker in the neighborhood
Far as troublemakin' goes, yeah
House party up the road, yeah
I'm not Kid 'n Play
This kid doesn't play about the flow, yeah

Tat my name on you, girl, so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell a bad bitch "Girl, let's go hang"
You know me, Rolex, gold chain
Fuck with my young niggas, XO Gang
Get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches
Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows and Screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Now, let me gon' hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything to make shit go slow
Yeah, money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in us, oh, no

[Chorus: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?


[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
It's simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker-free, no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My momma still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker, drums playing
Tap-dance to my drum roll (Uh)
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled

[Chorus: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it

You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?

[Verse 3: Drake]
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up in some old shit to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make do with what's left
Yeah, I do this shit to the death, yeah, I do this shit til I'm gone
Yeah, I told you it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong, ooh
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let these niggas know it's real
What's up?


[Chorus: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy

[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do

(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

[Verse 1]
Uhh, focus on women then you get less done
It's light work, flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think being broke is less fun
Celebratin' Father's day every day so don't get sonned
Where you tryna go, I'm ready
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm standing on these couches sayin'
"Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch!"
Pardon me, that was rude
If you just started balling I say I'm 'bout to conclude
What more is there to do
And why I would pretend
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND' (damn)


[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!

'Cause we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, look
Me and 40 whilin', stylin'
Somehwere on the island
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And I'm callin' your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my dialin'
Never embellish, believe 'em 'cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previously exist
I wonder what I be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your old man?
He couldn't have done it like this sho' nuff
I tend to dro puff
I'm throwed and I'm high
I guess I'm throwed up
Tone it all down
My nigga grow up
And tell me when you start getting paid to show up, damn


[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do it!

I got friends with money, and I got money too

You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?


[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?


[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Outro: Baka]
Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to know yourself

[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

I wish you could see
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda, coulda, wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin' my time
'Cause she heard it all
'Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But you heard it all
Well I'ma say it anyway
Shawty, I'm from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You ain't gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I'm just tryna say
I'm from the city, oh
Where the money makes a difference
But it never made us different, oh

[Intro: Birdman & Nicki Minaj]
Yeah
Cut it up, gimme a light
Yeah, and by the way, nigga
It's Young Mula
First Lady
Ugh, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Let us begin with a bad lil' specimen
Balenciagas, only things I be steppin in
Pucci bathing suits, only thing I'm dressing in
'Cause I get wetter than a navy seal veteran
Got—Got 'em writin love letters in they jour-n-al
Keep 'em on they toes like a midget at the urinal
Bad—Bad—Bad-Bad—Bad—Bad as I wanna be
She ain't bad, she a sad little wannabe

[Interlude: Birdman]
Yeah. Fuck the bullshit. It's big money popping. Young Mula! Yeah, just like that. What up, young nigga? Let's go. Gudda, brrrat!

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Okay, we running this shit, when we walk in the building
Got bitches from wall to wall, hoes hangin from the ceiling
Young Money we 'bout to kill 'em, I promise I make a million
And if they didn't have no hands I'll bet them bitches gon' feel 'em
I'm talkin money and power; you getting money? I doubt it
Fresher than baby powder, with your bitch in the shower
That pussy, I'ma devour; I beat it up 'til it's sour
No need for you to even trip; bitch I'll be done in a hour, let's go


[Interlude: Birdman & Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Yeah, that's more like it
Junior!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Birdman]
They say the blacker the berry, the redder the cherry
I say the sweeter it is—you dig? Buried
Then the bullshit varies, and it got me wary
But I know two are the same—call it "murdered" and "married" (Believe that!)
Hustling is so necessary, with no adversaries
But ain't no love, like a calendar with no Februarys
I'ma need four secretary, and four Bloody Marys
I'ma go eat me some pussy, and choke off the cherry—I'm gone

[Interlude: Birdman]
Yeah, fully loaded with it
To the ceiling with it
More money than you ever seen, nigga!
Aight, Drizzy, Drake—

[Verse 4: Drake & Birdman]
Look, kill the game, no one recovers the murder weapon
Young Angel, if you hate me tell me burn in heaven (Brrrrat!)
How'd ya sleep on me? The highest earnin freshmen
Like your third infection, I hope you learned your lesson (Yeah)
Yeah, I spit raw, but I prefer protection
I own a heart and a mind and a shirt she slept in
Bitch, I got the answer, and still ain't heard the question
I shut your club down, please reserve my section
Fuck a confrontation, there ain't no cake in it
And I'm caking, bitch, so tell me why I'd take a break from it
The mother of your child always tell you I'm her favorite
She call me her baby—not the one she was in labor with
She say, "Ooh, you taste good," I say, "Ooh, just savor it"
She know that she love a nigga, I be on that major shit
'Cause I get paid to stand, and I get paid to sit
So I don't walk around with money, baby girl—I'm made of it



[Intro]
Yea!
Webby
Bars are still on me man
I just keep going
CT where you at
Yea, it's like that

See I'm a beast
Always have been, always will be
Hungry, a seven course meal couldn't fill me
Wanna come and step to the flow then fucka feel free
I can make a lyricist look like Lil' B
Been in the game for a minute under your radar
Building my momentum for the moment that I'll take charge
My reflection still the same like spelling racecar
Now I've just come far enough to overcome the race card
Let me break it off proper
Freestylin' to your chick, yea take it off mama
I'm a professional showing you who really hotter
Gotta smaller chance of beating me than finding Jimmy Hoffa
Got a lot of people rolling with me how is it a shocker
That I made it to the top, spittin' out this molten lava
But now I'm fryin' rappers up like some cala-mari
Sorry, I'm chewin' any beat like a piranha
With the weed up in my paper or up in a Philly, fuck it
Until I'm on a beach with a margarita like Jimmy Buffet
I be spittin' these flows, time to really get it man
Snappin' like a gorilla wearing a silly band
Like a tattooed grizzly
Sick, representing Raccoon City
Playin' these shows, then I smash two bitties
Blazin' these flows 'til I stack two milli
Came up in the game like a certified hustler
Pedal to the metal 'til I'm burning my muffler
Fuck ya, everyday I stay smoking
My jar is ajar yea keep that shit open, potent
They can't measure up I'm too tall yo
Choke 'em, murder on the mic and now they all know
Frozen, spit it so cold that I cause snow
You gon' need a sweater and beanie like waldo
Mother fucker I am that dude
Who else could pull off these Super Mario tattoos
I got these other rappers salty like cashews
Cause I'm bad news, for my competition, that's true
Comin' through, my dude, I live limitless
Sick, achoo, I proved I spit vigorous
Hating on me while I bruise your chicks clitoris
She was into it and I was into her, get it bitch?
Kid Icarus, flying through the clouds
With a bottle full of liquor and a pocket full of loud
G-g-go across the country and I'm rockin' every crowd
I'm a dog, one hundred deeds of Eddie McDowd
And I'm a spit my damn flows, suburban commando
Call me Rambo, backpack on like Banjo
Kazooie, truly in charge like soprano
And Jacks at the head of the table of Samcro
My mind wanders while I'm writing a free-verse
And this weed only makes my A.D.D. worse
But I'm coming with the bars let the beast work
That's why your little sister got a Webby t-shirt
Rocking, dope hip-hopping
Full speed with it and I never plan on stopping
Italiano on the mic so yo he fucking mobbin'
All I do is murder beats I got a fucking problem


[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I love all my bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
A two dollar bill is still a couple dollars
And if any one of them niggas got a fuckin' problem
I'mma milk all of 'em cause they fuckin' cowards
I love red bitches, there's just something 'bout 'em
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater
I'm the shit, where the fly swatter

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I know you dykin' who you eatin' on
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em to each his own, yessir
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off
Like it just be callin' me, I need to turn my ringer off
Ain't a fuckin' singalong unless you brought the weed along
That kush, okay I got it, that kush
Cop pounds and put my people on
We can take the stairs up to the stars that's where we belong
Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian, or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction
She looked me in my eyes and said
Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I said shorty, you a beast


[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I love bad bitches, okay, what's the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up then I'mma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housing
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsing
I was 15 with $100,000
And if you talk trash I'mma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi

[Verse 2: Euro]
I heard 'em tell me "Go get 'em, young"
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag (You choose)
And all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prolly gon' bruise"
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
That sick shit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms
(Euro)


[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide em
Can't live with em, Can't live without em
Can't trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a fuckin problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me
I ain't looking for a lady, call Will Smith to get you hitched
I ain't looking for a wife, I need a one night trick
That can ride it like that, suck it like this
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip
I'm a mac, I'm a pimp girl
You don't need make up, put this mac on your lips
She drive a X5, beefin' with her ex man
Baby Ima dog and a DMX fan
Told myself I wouldn't mess with my ex again
Popped a lil x then i tried explain
I keep it too real to ever be a lame
Too many girls in this world, you all be lame
She all on my dick cause I got street fame
Told that thirsty ass bitch don't speak my name
Kidd Kidd, a nut from the 9
Tell em don't worry bout me I'm just fine
Girl if you comin' with me then let's ride
I know you want money so don't waste my time
Uh, wear that ass out fuck her till we pass out
Fuck a hotel, we goin' to my mans house
Scratch that your baby mama was an Amtrak
We treat that pussy like some good weed and pass that
Yeah, to my niggas, she fuck my niggas
Bought some bitches, and she was wit' it
With you she wasn't, but she did it
She let you lick it, but never stick it
You be trippin, you say you fallin
Nigga you slippin, stupid ass nigga tryna' fall in love
If i fall it's gon be from too many drugs
You asking questions, bout what she was
With the rider game, she told you in the club

[Refrain - Bazoo] x2
A l'école, mauvais élève, c'était un putain de problème
Pour ta soi-disant relève, on est un putain de problème
Nos ghetto-youth, nos amazones ont tous un putain de problème
Passe nous voir à la zone si t'as un putain de problème

[Couplet 1 - KRM]
J'écris des phases anormales, mon cerveau n'est pas terrien
Venu décrasser vos oreilles, flow anti-bacterien
Cousin dans ma ville, c'est pas le textile qu'on blanchit
Mais tout l'oseille qu'on prend : ients-cli sur les plans shit
On survit chaque jour au risque de finir menottés
Ma liberté d'expression taquine ceux qui veulent me noter
Désolé, c'est pas compliqué, j'aime plutôt faire simple
On sortira le fer sin-c, mental d'acier pour la guerre sainte
Crache des rimes en rafale dans la bouche, j'ai une méchante arme
Rimeur légendaire, mon rap fait peur même aux gendarmes
Gratte des pages de phases, un gros spliff quand les gens dorment
C'est un gros majeur aux wacks-MC que mes chants forment
Je compte réussir un minimum avant que mes proches partent
Ça kick un peu partout, mais khey, j'ai encore les poches plates
Mon rap pue la ligne 13, voilà pourquoi il parait crade
J'suis tellement chaud comme Johnny quand j'allume le feu, tout Paris crame

[Refrain - Bazoo] x2


[Couplet 2 - Agrüm]
Je pense avec ma bite, en gros mon instinct me guide
Je suis pas à l'abri d'une fin tragique
Ecrire est une drogue, croire en soi est une force
Quatre MC sur une prod, le BPM suffoque
A la street, c'est XXX
L'argent ne fait pas le bonheur si t'as moins de valeur qu'un billet
Tu sais dans - Tu sais dans quelle case nous trier
Etape par étape, avant de nager, je préfère avoir pied
Bitch ! Me suivent qui m'aiment
Mes gens cassent la démarche pendant que ma flemme casse les miennes
Si je crache sur ta morale, compte pas sur moi pour effacer
On n'demande pas à un vandale de payer les pots cassés
Naze, retourne taffer ! Une fois titulaire, personne ne pourra me remplacer
Je m'installer, assiste à la mise à jour
J'en ai ma claque donc n'compte pas sur moi pour tendre l'autre joue

[Refrain - Bazoo] x2

[Couplet 3 - Bazoo]
Ils ont du mal avec nos styles hostiles au stylo
J'habite où ça se postiche, grossiste au kilo
Si c'était mieux avant, ben rallume ton mégots de spliff
Des XXX, les faux se pissent dessus, terminent à l'hospice
Égotrip, les go kiffent ! Pour les cailles-ra, les gothiques
Que du buzz, que des carrières anecdotiques
Les Tony du cro-mi, je les vomis, c'est tho-my
Pas de veste réversible, je resterai vrai, c'est promis
Ça kick dur, fuck la vie dégage
Je vous baise tous avec un doigt, David Guetta
Entre les tass' et les putains de sangsues
Je me balade avec un schlass et des chewing-gum sans sucres
Alors toi tu veux percer ? Lé lé la
Essaye plutôt le tiercé, Oua oua oua
On arrive du Paname où tu mets pas les ieds-p
Fuck le slam, Grand Corps Malade, je lui mets une balayette


[Refrain - Bazoo] x2

[Couplet 4 - Hancock]
XXX Y'a trop d'écart en fait
Je me porte garant de cette merde, ma bière à 47 centimes
Et je me barre en cette-su ouais re-noi, car on le sait
Que dehors, je parle en zeb et petite parenthèse, ça rend mes parents septiques
Mais dés le départ, je t'enseigne des rythmiques à t'en faire flipper
L'équipage t'encercle, ouais l'équipe XXX vibrer
Face à nos prestations vraies, on baise ta science frère
Le best sale fion, faites pas le XXX, je garde cette passion près de moi
Les médias sombrer, c'est ce que je souhaite de plus profond
Mais pour l'instant, XXX
Mec, c'est chouette, je suis plutôt fonce-dé !
Merde ! C'est ce que tu te dis quand t'écoutes ça gars !
On joue des coudes secs, goûte ça garce, des coups de savatte
Remballe tes chances stériles, tu vas bousiller mes enceintes
Si on se fume nos races, c'est que la méchanceté roule
XXX sur ce R.A.P et rapidement
Eh raclure ? Je peux t’appeler Sevrine ou XXX

[Refrain - Bazoo] x2

Make you think about all of the niggas you been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju-, okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin', I'm beast

Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley, now
Vacay'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali (Mmm)
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Mmm)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Mmm)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow (Mmm) Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holler back, I'll do ya, beast


[Chorus: 2 Chainz, Drake & Both]

(Verse: Busta Rhymes)
What they say now? Talk to me Boo
Tell me what you and your bitches really wanna do
We just met and I like to fuck in case you never knew
Beat up the pussy on the balcony, better view
Go ahead and suck that dick but never chew
No need to leave your girls out, you could bring em too
Ass bouncing on a nigga like a kangaroo
From One Oak to Green House, 01 Avenue
Fuck them til they in a coma and they got a clue
Smelling the pussy aroma, what you tryina prove?
Maxi van soldier in the fountain blue
Still spreadin money from my deal with Mountain Dew
I love bad bitches, that’s my fuckin problem
Especially when I got a lot of fuckin options
Bid on the baddest, it’s like a fuckin auction
I need a new endulgment from a fuckin condom

Same issue that I’m havin with you’s fuckin all
So why does fuckin problem even considered a fuckin problem?
Yea, I’m fuckin bad bitches from LA to Boston
New York City, Kansa City, all the way to Austin
Sexes while look at my necklace
She hop on my check list, fuck her and her best friend
My flow is infection, she should be arrested
I’m young and I’m reckless, you must have a death wish
If you try to go against me nigga
I put you and yo career under 6 feet nigga
I see no contender less I’m lookin in the mirror
Told your girl come surrender to my heart, don’t remember
Got a fallout like November but I’m colder than December
Got money on my agenda, come roll on this adventure
Motherfucker I beast

[Verse: Trey Songz]
I love bad bitches, I'm such a savage it's ridiculous
Show me a bad bitch and I'll give her a dick to kiss
Tell her tongue it down, throat emphasis
Give me brain 'til her brain can't remember shit
I make it summer rain though she got December dick
Let her states remain and I leave my name in it
I mean I put my name on it
Got a picture perfect pussy, I'mma put a frame on it
I keep it so a hundred but positions change on it
She told me how she want it, her face I came on it
I'm never disappointed, I left her disjointed
Pancakes and eggs with some head in the morning
They say money make a nigga act nigga-ish
White hoes love nigga dick
Don't know why I always got another nigga's bitch
But I bet I'll always put it in her ribs, I beast


[Chorus: 2 Chainz, Drake & A$AP Rocky]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember, being young, dumb, looking for the next thrill
Angry adolescents, three things on our minds
Money, murder and you

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Picture perfect, uh huh
And I paint a perfect picture, my intention's to get richer
But I ain't tryna split the profit with ya
Every pocket on me bleeds, I'm a selfish ass nigga
Mmm, deuces up, black coupes is us (Uh, huh)
Or maybe the white on white, Ku and Klux
Head all in the bathroom
Beg for it, I'll be back soon
Fuckin' problem, fuck your problems
I got my own but one ain't a dollar
I got five phones for five different reasons
London, Tasha, Mya, Keisha
Courtney, blue-eyed devils with no Visas
Overseas, high heels, wine and pizza
Overdosed on bad bitches, I swear
One on both arm but need two pair, I beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, (Drake) & A$AP Rocky]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz-is-to-Me-Just-a-Car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya, beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, (Drake) & A$AP Rocky]

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Here it come, there it goes, guess I'm rolling up the marijuana
Well known as the boss, it's the bottle popping
Talking down, she wanna ball like Cyndi Lauper
I get the cheddar here, baby girl a blood but she kinda cute
Let a nigga gang bang in the found blue (Su-woo)
Red beamer and it's brand new
So shout out to the bitches we done ran through
True connoisseur carnivores, to the whores
Yeah you running with the flow, it wasn't yours
All the boss got butter, it's all gold
Stalley showed it to me first now fast forward
The land lord my influence, is speaking Jewish
Need to get you some insurance for smoking too much
This shit a movie pick a theater in the crib
And you know I got the pole, we get it in, we get it in

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Drake]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem

(And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Speeding in my fast car, reminiscing on the girl that I last saw
And how she cut wood like a hacksaw, wax on wax off man that ass soft
Attached to my fitted, but I get that kitten hat soft
I was jimmy hat strapped when I fell up in that cat: pause
All over my body, me on for my yoning balls had the head down
Tails up like a coin toss rolling up a body
Stretching like Pilate, 110 Maserati
Burning down the highway, burning on some Marley
Could this be love infatuation of the body?
The facts is that I'm sloppy with my feelings and it's got me
Chasing love at six in the morning, horny as a dog in heat chasing after pony
The streets is lonely, but it's just me and the stars
Me and my thoughts, could it be me and the Goddess?
Well if I play my cards right, tarot cards on my dashboard if they re-write
Or leave me right back to my queen tonight, right?

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Drake]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
(I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it


DONT KNOW THE LYRICS

[Produced by  Noah "40" Shebib and Hagler/Co-Produced by Jake One]

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know


[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Beat Switch]


[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

[Outro]
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to

**Lyrics from Snippet**

[Drake]
Trust me this ain't about revenge
But now I get along better with your friend



[Verse: Drake]
Digital camera, freeze the moments
Use money and talent as my lead component
Normally Drake sip Don P but
You the type of girl that I need Patron with
We could do it, corporate sponsor
Your man prolly riding in his boy's Elantra
You could drop him, he's forgotten, you got options
And plus I show these young boys how to bring the money on in
When they rhymes ain't hot, and they records don't sell
Stuntin' on the strip, came with no I.D
And I only brought cash, if they checkin' oh well
I'm good, Drake make one phone call and I'm inside
Welcome to the life of an icon
And I don't like jewels, but I am thinkin' of you
In the mirror while I'm puttin' all this ice on
So

[Chorus: Lloyd (Drake)]
All I really want is
For you to back it up, go on and put ya weight on it
Cause it's alright, do what you wanna
Make me believe ya
Ooh I wanna see ya
(Get it shawty) get it shawty, get it shawty
(Yeah man, ATF Street Love)
Get-get-get-get-get
Get it shawty, get it shawty

[Outro: Drake]
Lloyd I see you Danny
Atlanta I see you, and if its ten
Toronto, Do it for Y'all
Yeah man


[Verse 1: Jorja Smith]
Hello
I've been hurt so many times
It got to a point
When I decided
I can't do this anymore
I need someone to hold me
I need someone that needs me
I need someone that loves me

[Chorus: Drake, Both]
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to
(Yeah, yeah)
You need me to

[Verse 2: Jorja Smith]
You know, we don't have to be dramatic
Just romantic
Do all the little things, little things, little things
That excites me
As your woman
Give me a kiss goodnight
Over the phone
When you're working late
When you're out of town
Tell me how much you need this
'Cause we deserve it
We can be together, but


[Chorus: Both, Drake]
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to (Yeah, yeah)
You need me to (Yeah)
You need me to

[Outro: Drake & Burna Boy]
Hold one vibes
Pree more life
Cuh we ah pree more life

Dun know already, cuz



Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer. And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes
N.E.R.D flow, i spaz if im prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote
Money is everythang, and its every other thing
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang
Cash is the right now, women are the post game
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain
It's comin too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin
It's on meee, everything is on meee
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis
Nebby Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness.. Drizzy!

Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone
Homie scared. Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I ain't talkin moths but you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order
Whatever ya'll please.. wine crackers and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my t's
This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese
My watch make the frickin' time freeze
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money.. bitch...

Dj Drama: See I told ya'll it'd be well worth the wait right?

Wayne: Dedication threeee




[Intro]

So I'mma start this off like you would do it
Uh, shout out to DJ Wristpect
October's Own!
Drizzy, haha
Here I go!
Uh

[Verse]
Look, I stands out
Don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, hah, ask Apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, "Hey bitches!"
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description, hah
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of OVO
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame?
Cause they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it

[Hook]
And all you talking ass niggas, get over it
And all you people that be hating, get over it
And all you women that I fucked, get over it
And yeah, I'm turning 22, get over it
You know you got to hear my records, get over it
My whole team getting rich, get over it
I got the city on my back, get over it
Get over it, get over it

[Outro]
Hahaha, DJ Wrispect
Little Brother

[Hook: Belly]
She can make it go..
Bring it high, bring it down, take it low..then make it go..
She can make it go..
She start off going fast but then she take it slow (she take it slow)
Then make it go (she take it slow)
She can make it..
She make it then it sound like (sound like)
She make it, then it sound like (YEAH)
She make it, then it sound like (sound like)
She make it, then it sound like..

[Belly: Verse 1]

She does it to me like i never felt it, I can't help it
Helpless, melting in her presence, I am selfish she can tell this
She can tell me anything; I'll buy it if she sells it
Told me her name is heaven, but she's hotter than hell is
Love locked down; I'll be your felon
Wait.. she love to get her pussy ate like Ellen
One two, you can come she can come too
You gon' cum, she gon' cum too
Pass out, & do it all again when we come to
We can kick it like a shoe.. KungFu
She make it stop, pop like the drum do
These bitches typical, you show me sumthin' new


[Belly: Hook]

[Drake: Verse 2:]
I tell her, I tell her:
We not just any guys
I bet they broke for a reason, no need to empathize
I tell patron truths, i tell you henny lies
And you believe'em all; I can see it in your eyes
I take you down like (down like)
Me without no money, that don't sound right (sound right)
I could put you on this side of town flight
And even have a driver pick you up girl, what that sound like (sound like)
I guess big big money, all this money
I don't even know what to call this honey
Takes so long just to get to the point where you're rich and you're there and its all so funny
I stunt so they can see me, & therefore they should know
They call me Drizzy baby, wanna see you 'make it go'

[Drake: Hook]
She can make it go
Bring it high, bring it down, take it low, then make it go
She can make it go; start off going fast but then she take it slow, take it slow
She can make it..
She make it & it sound like (sound like)
She make it, & it sound like (LIKE)
She make it, & it sound like (sound like)
She make it, & it sound like: (sound like)(sound like)
Uh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy, James Fauntleroy & Drake]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you


[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name


[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you



[Verse 1: Drake]
Look I know girls love Beyoncé, girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing, and shawty you ain’t no different
These days it’s hard to meet women, feel like my love life is finished
I’ve been avoiding commitment that's why I’m in this position
I’m scared to let somebody in on this, no new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go, you got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games, say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby, why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Look, I know girls love Rihanna, girls love to play with your mindset
Girls always find out the business, and baby you ain't no different
I think I've met a few women, who know the meaning of winning
So I'mma take one and leave here, 'cause girl we don't have to be here
I'm 'bout to let somebody
In on this, old friend, she is new friends
She knows me from way back when I
Know she knows my ways
The way I was from way back then, these people won't believe the years
We've spent before as friends, now we're together she can say

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games, say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby, why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, uh... Say my name, say my name, cause those other men are practice
And this ain’t no time for actin’, and this ain’t no time for games
And this ain’t no time for uncertainty, and this ain’t no time for locking your phone
And not coming home and startin’ some shit when I’m in the zone
This is why I’ve been saying, "no new friends, no no no"
You know how this shit goes, this is not four years ago
Time escapes me, now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more; neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I’m not alone, even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone, let me make you say my name, say my name

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games, say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby, why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you


[Verse 1]
Look, I know
Girls love Rihanna
Girls love to act like they famous
Girls hate when niggas get smarter
Catching the moves that they thought of
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like they all ain't no different
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friend, no no new
You know just how this goes
You got your fair share of admirers
That call your phone
Your ringtones 'Pour it up'
So you be turnt up all night long

[Hook]
But if you're alone then
Pour it up, Pour it up
Watch it all fall down
Girl that's how we ball out
Go on and take a puff
Pour it up, Pour it up
That's how we ball out
Watch it all fall down
Pour it up, Pour it up
Pour it up, Pour it up
Watch it all fall down


[​Verse 2]
Pour it up, Pour it up
Cause those other boys are practice
And this ain't no time for acting
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for Instagram
And this ain't no time for locking your phone
And hiding your message when you doing wrong
And I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know just how this go
This is not four years ago
Your girls tell you all the wrong things
And they know that they all wrong
I come up with hits that make
Your home girls wanna call my phone
All my young boys round me screaming
"Get rich and buy shoes and clothes"
Where we learn these values?
I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason
Not to go out every weekend
I need someone that will help me
Think of someone besides myself
I need someone who don't like rappers
No, Cuse I dont wanna fight no more
Plus I'm not wild no more
Neither one of us wanna be called a child no more
No im not alone
Even though my heart is tucked
Let me get yo girls alone
So i can make yall
Pour it up, pour it up



[Intro: Summer Walker]
Honestly

[Verse 1: Summer Walker]
Honestly, I'm tryin' to stay focused
You must think I've got to be joking when I say
I don't think I can wait
I just need it now, better swing my way
I just need some dick, I just need some love
Tired of fucking with these lame niggas, baby
I just need a thug
Won't you be my plug? Ayy
You could be the one, ayy
We could start with a handshake, baby
I'ma need more than a hug

[Chorus: Summer Walker]
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now, oh now

[Verse 2: Summer Walker & Drake]
Give it to me like you need it, baby
Want you to hear me screaming, heavy breathing
I don't need a reason, baby
I want it 'til you can't fight
I can give it to you right, babe, oh
I wanna be your healing
I can be real good
Please don't get in your feelings
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, and you can't judge (I won't)

[Verse 3: Drake]
You don't really call on me like you should
Link up, I'll roll through the hood
Problems, but everything's all good, my love
Your nigga doesn't want smoke with me, nah, no way
Trust me, it's all okay, trust me, it's all
You just need some, someone that's calm and patient
Submission, domination
Arched back, deep stroke
White wine, weed smoke
That's my best combination
You just need some dick with no complications
You just need some, you just need some
Late night attention, uncondition
All that you're missing, my babe
Fucked up, shouldn't even have to justify
I get it, I'm on your side, guys get their way all the time
Besides, pleasure not meant for one side
You should just do what's best for your mind
How 'bout I just take my time?
You call up my line, I fall up inside you
Girls need love, too, I know

[Chorus: Summer Walker]
Girls need love, too (Yeah)
Girls, girls need love, too (Ooh)
Girls need love (Let me tell you something)
Girls need love (Girls need loving, too, yeah yeah yeah)
Girls need love, too
Girls need love, too
(So what's a girl to do when she needs loving, too?)
Girls need love, too
Girls need love, too


[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best


[Chorus: Trey Songz]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
(It's The Prince, look here)
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Hennessy, straight, no cubes
Take me where the women be, I won't lose
Drake take Patrón to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? They call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya


[Chorus: Trey Songz]
When I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)
It ain't a woman in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a woman not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)
It ain't a woman in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a woman not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya



[Chorus: Kanye West]
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certifi-i-ied
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I

(It's all love when I ride top down) Top down
I started out way down low
Started from the bottom, now we here now

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 5: Drake]
I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 7: Drake]
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

[Outro: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love y'all too!
We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life
You need devotion
Can I hear right on?
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We live for it
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all
I said it's alright
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all

[Interlude: Drake]
She said, 'Do you love me?"
I tell her "Only partly,"
"I only love my bed and my momma I'm sorry"

[Verse 2: Drake]
50 dubs, I even got tatted on me
81 they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the 02 to the 03 dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never left the broskies

[Hook: Drake]
God's plan, God's plan

[Outro: Trippie Redd]

Oh yeah!




[Intro]
Tryna keep my heart on me, yeah
Tryna keep the struggle off me, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me (No, no)
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me (Wishin', they wishin')
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

[Chorus]
God's plan (God's plan), God's plan (Oh yeah)
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh (I won't, yuh)
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy (Ooh yeah)
Swear they turn their lies on me, yeah, yeah

Say your bitch, she wanted me, oh yeah

Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me

Turn a O2 into a O3, dog (Yeah)
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me

[Chorus]

[Intro: Drake & Future]
Yeah
(Wheezy outta here)
Jeez, jeez

[Verse 1: Drake]
Back home, smokin' legal (Legal)
I got more slaps than The Beatles (Beatles)
Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg (Who you say you was?)
Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely (Strapped)
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me (What you gotta do?)
Bring the clip back empty (It's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (Sent me, dawg)
I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg (10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day


[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway (What?)
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade
Still goin' bad on you anyway

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
Woah, woah, ooh, woah
Woah, woah, ah

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris (80 racks)
Me and Drizzy back-to-back, it's gettin' scary (Back-to-back)
If you fuckin' with my opps, just don't come near me (Get outta my way)
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille cost a Lambo (That's a Lambo)
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando (Salute)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)
Ain't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go (That's a Fendi)
For real
She said, "Oh, you rich rich?" ("You rich rich")
Bitch, I graduated, call me "Big Fish" (Marlin)
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list (That's Lori)
That's the only thing I want for Christmas (True story, uh)
I've been had my way out here, yeah, know that's facts (Facts)
You ain't livin' that shit you say, yeah, we know that's cap (That's cap)
You ain't got to ask me when you see me, know I'm strapped (Brrt)
DC, OVO, we back again, we goin' plat' (Ooh, ooh)


[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

[Outro: Future]
Wheezy outta here

[Verse]
I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She used to be a Christian before
Now, all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like, "Baby, those are cute, I adore those"
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understand the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash-only transactions, homie
And please, no receipts—the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
Been doing it for years, homie; thoroughly, I thought it...
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track
Admitting most of my currency’s imported
But too late now, it's too legitimate to hit 'em with...
A lawsuit, even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker playing in the whip
As they pull me over, "my sweet surrender"
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A Menschkeit, as they say; he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present, every regal member
The coalition is so efficient
You have to be invited, or there's no admission
We know tradition, we spend money
So don't try to compete if you in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in the basement that Renny grew his piff in
When Pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'Til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team-playing, no screen-setting
"Because I wanna win games, Coach, I'm through assisting"
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
And I'ma keep killing 'em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshitting, but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality, so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumping
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinking what I could've done to make my first video groundbreaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talking 'bout the D I'm throwing in your wife
I treat this one session as if it were my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that!



[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
I'm home now, it's over now, so...
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
She got a thing for Chanel vintage that dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20/20 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacán
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart
Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
"I gotta get the most of everything" is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world

[Chorus: Drake & Rick Ross]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, it's too late
This different right here, yo

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin' love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (Forever)
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)
(Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' (Stop talkin', stop talkin')

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)

Gun at your eyebrow: Pow-Pow
Man I ball hard, even with five fouls
Yeah, we in this bitch, like tampons
Dump you in the woods, now get your camp on
Choke-hold around this shit 'cause I’m so hands-on
I get high as fuck and Polo sheets is what I lands on
Back against the wall, and my two feet is what I stand on
Diva in the room, she blowing me just like a band horn
Got her on her knees, the same knees that she be praying on
Now she just text her girlfriend with a capital "You can join"
Yeah, what y’all wanna do? I’m all ears
Smoking on that headband, call that shit that Paul Pierce

Pussy ass nigga, I don’t want your gonorrhea

[Verse 3: Drake]
I am spending much more than I’m making
On these cars and these vacations, is that too much information?
I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racing
With a windshield full of tickets cause I live right by the station
I am tryna figure out why you so mad at me
Yes, I’m with Young Money, tell the magazine stop asking me
I be with the dread with the tattoos on his head
And a flag the color red like a fucking low battery
(Okay) Nigga peep the shit I’m wyling on
I be with your baby mama, you be with your child at home
Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of styrofoam
Big cheese big bread call that shit a calzone
(Okay) I will break your fucking collar bone

Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady putting mileage on
And we about to kill 'em, C4, Mr. Carter's home

You keep talking that shit, I’ma see ya
Kill your senorita and and your fucking Mama Mia


[Verse 1: The Game]
Since Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man
Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There’s missing women out there, let’s just focus on them
This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya
You ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air
Cause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair


[Hook]
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no (I won't)
If you don't, you gon’ really love us  (I said I won't)
Please don’t use us, dooon’t

[Verse 2: Drake]
Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with?
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in 10 years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me, yeah
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches, know I’m coming straight to you good girl


[Hook]
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon’ really love us
Please don’t use us, noo

[Verse 3: The Game]
Drizzy, I'm sitting here watching Basketball Wives
Like, "uhh, them is basketball wives?"
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick
Can't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date
I pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass "get on!"
Disrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like "hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world"
Get busy girl, drink that rosé 'til you're dizzy girl
She walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?
He on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Don spray
That’s your girl? Nigga go on and make her cry
Soon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like "let's ride"

[Hook]
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don’t make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon’ really love us
Please don’t use us, nooo


[Verse 4: The Game]
Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And thats my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy
Surrounded by them diamonds, I'mma cold mackin
Nigga its a cold climate, don’t ask me where the crime went
Just tell me where them dimes went
So I can get em fitted, let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas
Yeah I’m married to the game
And she married to my chain, watching Boyz n The Hood
Lets take a drive down memory lane

[Intro: Future]
Yeah, yeah, BeenTrill, the movie, hosted by yours truly. The Astronaut Kid, motherfucker. Been trill, been doin’ it, been at it. Been start doin’ in this shit before you niggas. Been fly, been underrated, been grindin’, been payin’ dues. Been smashin’ your bitch, nigga. Been turnin’ up. We been had it. We been at it. We been making classics, motherfucker. Been trill, nigga. Future Hendrix. Astronaut nigga. Still on Pluto motherfucker

[Hook: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'mma ball til the day I fall

[Hook 2: Drake]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me

[Verse 1: Future]
I suffered like immigrants, now my bitches immigrants
Young niggas ain’t got remorse, they shootin' at your innocence
You put in your own work, you reap all your benefits
You grind til’ you shed a tear, like, why I get put in for
I done it, lost it all, I had no one to call
We living on couches, these niggas ain’t 'bout shit
Take a straight shot to the head, face first sippin' ain’t scared
But it’s time to break bread, she asked how much I need
I’m ‘bout to fuck the hood out this bitch ad roll me some weed
I can’t see it like I want to, but she’s always there for me
It’s been hate the days in the streets and I have nobody
When I'm stressing, I hit her up and then we talk ‘bout it


[Hook: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'mma ball til the day I fall

[Hook 2: Drake]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me

[Verse 2: Future]
OG, Granddaddy, blowing like a chimney
Last night I passed out mixed for a women
Can’t keep it real with niggas, you got to handle business
You can’t see what I go through cuz it’s covered with all my image
And I love this life, and I won’t trade it for the world
And these niggas fake, that’s why you got to fuck their girls
Get high as kites, and we taking shot’s of syrup
I can’t see myself, if I was looking in the mirror
I don’t understand the haters and I will never understand it
These niggas rather see you fall, than see you standin’
These niggas they'll leave you for dead while you breathin'
I feel like she love me, unconditionally, know I can see it


[Hook: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'mma ball til the day I fall

[Hook 2: Drake]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me

[Intro]
Yeah (Word!)
Yeah man (What?)
(Love me) It’s Drizzy baby (Mayday!)
You know what it is, from T-Dot to the world
My man Rebstar (Rebstar!), T-Williams (Yeah!), Boi-1da

[Verse 1:Drake]
Look, I know you miss me, go on admit it girl
Cause everything he doing for you, I done did it girl
So call me up late, I know you with it girl
I get a rush from it, knowing you commited girl
Beach front properties, panoramic views
You could probably catch him in Atlanta with his crew
Plus his whole vibe like candles and a pool
Cause he’s hot, but you notice how he handles it is cool
The name is Drake dawg, I came here solo
The smell is Dolce, the drawers is Polo
The DJs Future, the clothes is Ransom
The cut’s from J-Mac, ya boy is handsome
Pay me now, nigga cash advance him
Y’all don’t wanna see me throw no tantrum
We blowing up this year, it’s called expansion
Now everybody get to dancing to this, ah…..

[Hook]
I’m trying to make sure that you feel right
Cause you already know what it be like
Well dressed for the evening
Party hard like we ain’t leaving
Now let’s have a toast to the good life (Uh, huh)
Go ahead and keep drinks coming all night
Shoutout to the DJ, now please let me down here tonight
The way this make you feel, say oohhh
Tonight, the way
This make you feel, say oohhh
Toast to the good life…


[Verse 2: Rebstar]
My lawyer J-Money, but it’s not important
She seen the videos, but she don’t know my story
Army greens sneaks, homie GI Jordan
On another time zone, we party ’till the morning
My man looking up to me, he ’bout to sneeze
And she treating me like I be New Year’s Eve
Counting down the seconds untill she sees me (5, 4, 3, 2)
One time for the women that want it with Megan Fox
Two times for the ladies that never use Photoshop
Them other girls, they so vanilla
You gotta certain je ne sais quoi
They need to get their French up to par
And, uh, pardon me for asking
Anything I want, I must have it
I make it happen, poof, magic

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rock City]
To bring life, the infatuation
I’m only a figment of your imagination
When I talk, it’s no exaggeration
You won’t find another dude quite like me
(Uh, uh) Me and my everything crew
Everything’s big, everything’s new
Drinks on me, so what you wanna do?
Chill right here and head bop to the groove
Yeah, and it's VI for life
So if you want, we can fly to the VI tonight
Saint Thomas and Saint Croix, Saint John is nice
So girl, just let me know which one you like
(Uh) My plans now to live it up this year
That’s why I shine from my neck to my wristwear
We off, up in the party like we live here
Lights on, everybody’s gone, but we still here, yeah


[Hook]



I guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elevated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo', converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, nigga




[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

[Chorus]
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

[Verse 2]
But don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

[Chorus]
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long




[Verse 1: Bishop Brigante]
It's fuckin' losers like you that make me do what I do
Make me hate where I'm from, you as fake as they come
Everybody got guns, who the fuck gonna squeeze
Everybody got SARS, you ain't fucking with these
Why you wish to be ghetto, tell me what's it about
Why you tryna get in where I'm tryna get out
Why won't you just be yourself, why won't you tell us the truth
Like how you only load guns when you up in the booth
You ain't nothin' to shoot, you don't even exist
You just a fantasy, family as weak as it gets
And you ain't speakin' a bitch, cause I don't listen to chicks
I don't argue with broads, cause I'm really a pimp
But I will tell you this, as far as y'all are concerned
Pull out my Santa Claus, and make the holidays burn
You can call me the Grinch, cause y'all are nothing but Who's
Just another bunch of phony acts with nothing to prove

[Verse 2: Ken Masters]
Now let the kids play like the rider's ride
We spendin' all day, these niggas idolize
They claim they want fame nigga so we decided
That we gon' make 'em some stars until the drama dies
But they can go back to they holes where they mama lies
Or write more lies about they drugs, guns or homicide
Funny, claim the thug life that they abidin' by
But run up on 'em, then they turn into the silent type, they wanna compromise
My niggas, we ride or die
And roll with them bitches that got they body right
These niggas ain't built, ain't got the body type
Time to break a nigga's spirit like the Amistad, tryna fool the audience
Feel the ambience
Stars in your presence, kings of the city are appalled by the peasants
Ain't gotta say names, we can all get a reference
Brains and the info from your broads in the west end
Masters, flowing staggers on bars
Nigga stay mad cause his swagger's on Mars
Y'all niggas ain't thinking we calling y'all 'tards
Claim you want war, okay, on guard

[Verse 3: Young Tony]
Ayo, hey you Mr. Rapper Guy
When you in the booth, tell me why you have to lie
Come on, spit the truth, all I hear is bang bang, hustle this, hustle that
But if you hustle crack, then where the money at?
No proof, Dr. Seuss, story tellin' when he rhyme, like
Once upon a time I was really on the grind
There's another lie, couldn't out-hustle me
Hatin' when it come to D, I can take you're starting 5
I'm only goin' at generic rap niggas that
Rap about ki's but couldn't show me 10 G's
And these nigga' dry snitching on they tees
Standing out, like a sore thumb to the D's
My nigga please, if you really had work
You would do what you do and wouldn't put it on your shirt
It makes my heart hurt when dumb niggas act hood
You ain't no hustla, just a nigga that can rap good

[Verse 4: Jonny Roxx]
See there's a height requirement, nigga to mention my name (smarten up)
How the fuck you little niggas didn't stay in your lane
Man you offered me a truce and I took it
Now I hear this bullshit so how the fuck am I to overlook it?
If this little nigga survive then it gotta be God
How the fuck are you a hustla with your factory job ?
And I don't get it, nigga I'm a fucking diabetic
And I don't usually eat y'all sweet niggas
Every time I see y'all retard niggas y'all bitch out
Waddup Roxx? now we cool? then you dip out
Talkin' all that bang bang shit, pull a clip out
Sayin' you a blood, next week you prolly crip out
I'm saying, we don't believe y'all niggas (nah)
G-35, x5 nah niggas (yeah)
This here is a public announcement for my niggas (yeah)
No more goodnight, good mornin', goodbye niggas

[Verse 5: JD Era]
I don't appreciate niggas sayin' my name in they bullshit
It's like putting a knife against the lyrical full-clip
Do shit on my own, I never asked for help
If I was rapping like y'all I woulda killed myself
And nah, this ain't beef, it's missing a few ingredients
Dog you ain't a general, stick to being obedient
Piggy back, that ain't something I had to do
Laughing at Drake? you should'a seen how I was laughing at you
I don't beef over little shit, angry? A little bit
Little niggas get little recognition you little bitch
I don't do the little subliminals, I'm addressin' it
And if Littles wanna get in the middle then I'm suggesting it
They called you a bitch, were tryna act out
They challenge 'em to a fight and then they back out
So tell me how the fuck I can respect you cats
If you a gangsta, then what part of the game is that?

[Verse 6: Drake]
Hey yo Aristo, I'm lost, can you tell me whats goin' on in the streets?
How it feel to count dough while you palmin' the heat?
And yes I asked for a 16, you did your 16
I heard that weak shit and only wanted the beat (it's true)
But fuck the money and the cars that I drive to set
And fuck the women that's lying to all the guys they met
And fuck the features on my songs and the deals on the table
Or basically it's fuck everything that you strive to get
And it's the room of resolution, I'm finishing it in here
If I copy Budden's flow, you mimickin' his career
And the same money we hearin' you giving to charity
You need to be giving to Littles to give him some clarity (what up Littles)
'Cause that's your homeboy I think he's owed that much
Tell him pressing 25 don't mean you sold that much
And Breana, I don't mean to alarm ya
But you need to get outside the car to shoot this video in Parma (Tony!)
You act like you hood and hood niggas'll harm ya
And this is not hatin' my nigga we call it karma
But yo Thug Life, show me where the hammer be
Yes I took an L on my own and they didn't damage me
You try to cover up your lies like a canopy
And tryna pull 17 year olds down in Bramalea (I know about it)
And we don't got it out for you
We just saying that don't nobody vouch for you
Nope, nobody thorough is willing to give a cosign (nobody)
And you don't even sell blow, you just blow time
You can't even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go fix parts at a tractor plant (damn)
And listen here, Tetley Tea
You one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
You probably snitchin' in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you paying these women and I sex for free (what up sweetheart)
But dog, how did this start, how we get to this part?
We all got niggas doing bids "Mr. Wishheart" (what up Cam)
It's not cool to use another nigga's as a threat tho'
I said you a bitch, I heard a seven man echo
You saying I hustle, my source for currency coke
They saying you never moving it and currently broke
And you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime
Just so you can have something to say in you rap lines
They say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school (I did)
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you
Lose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through
Tell them not to call and that's even if they require you
'Cause they the only people recording that wanna hire you (it's true)
With what I spend in a weekend I could acquire you
Some of them believe you got money you little liar you
But, I don't admire you, short niggas tell tall tales
Good riddance Aristo I just retired you!




[Verse]
You've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth

[Chorus]
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me

[Outro]
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me


[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Jheeze, yeah
Right, look, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell me how you really feel
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But y'all don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard you never claimed the hood
Heard the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big
That they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah
Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lotta sides on the same side
OVO, we a gold mine
But I'm goin' gold, no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city goin' crazy
Whole city goin' crazy
Top five, no debatin'
Top five, top five, top five
And the whole city rate me
And I'm back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit
We done really put some days in


[Interlude: Future]
Hey, why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?
What happened?
Did you win the Grammy? God damn
You actin' like you fuckin' won a trophy and shit
This nigga turnt the fuck up

[Chorus: Future]
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy

[Verse 2: Future]
Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax
Get pissed off, start airin' it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I don't want features from nan them
I don't want features or nothin'
You can't even get on my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter
We sittin' right on the courtside
I know the players on both side
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys
Black tints, low profile
Celebratin' everyday
'Cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house
Countin' up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out


[Chorus: Future]
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy



Uh, I am a distraction
Comin from my spot and I dont signal as I back in
If cash is beautiful, then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin’ centerfold of Maxim
Open to my page and admire my desire
Frequent flyer, I aspire to retire
My voice stands alone even if I’m with the choir
Got a cannon on my hip, but nigga, this is not Mariah
Na, this the record killer for hire
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require
Look I created, despite the niggas that hated
Every single bar gettin' first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin' so sedated
The me and bitch the same, we feel so related
Forest Hill estated, all dinners catered
I put a thousand on it, I could probably fuck the waitress
So, wait, just take this
Oone lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit
Drop a four in it and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga

[Verse 2]
I wrote this verse sittin' in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
It’s more about where you are
And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be
Somebody, somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how we're all ending up
I’m at the label in the elevator, send 'em up!


[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We The Best Music
Another one

[Chorus: Drake]
Come with me, leave all of your things, yeah

Full speed, survoler Paris
Come with me, leave all of your things, yeah
We can stop at Gucci, stop at Louis V, yeah
Come with me, fly you out to Greece
Full speed, survoler Paris

[Outro: Drake]
(Might just have to go in on that)
Never fallin', why you makin' problems?
I've been silent, why you makin' problems?
I'm a problem, bein' rich is not my fault
You decide who you think the shit reside with
I been quiet, hard to miss me when I'm flyin'
Gone out to Caicos, she can stay in my room
She can stay in my room, and it ain't my
I was tryna play it right
I was tryna treat you nice
Funny how I had to stop
See me when I'm outside
We ain't have a problem
Then you went and found one
How you gonna get a bag?
She can't help but get attached
See me when you're outside
See me on the Southside
I could tell you're sick inside
'Cause she just wanna love me
She don't wanna leave me
She just wanna love me
She don't wanna leave me

[Intro]

Pick, Michael Jackson to Jordan to Tyson to Myers
Too much dirty money when the colors

It ain’t rocket science just rockets
I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin'
I got this shit down to a science, I turn in my project, A minus
Whew, I ain’t crazy, I’m krazy and all of my niggas chaotic
Dressed in all black like they gothic
Music too loud to hear sirens, we pop, pop, pop up where you stay
Knock, knock, knock, anyone home?
Pop, pop, pop, pop then we outtie
I need a bitch like Naomi to take off her clothes like Leilani for niggas that’s grindin’


[Chorus: Lil Wayne]

Grind for all this shit, I ain’t ever fall for that bitch
'Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird

We'll bring Gucci bag in this bitch
And you know what's stashed in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out
Like Janet Jackson and shit
I’m sweatin’ grindin’ this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven

[Verse 3: Drake & Lil Wayne]
Yeah
I got a new vision for all my shit (for all my)
I don’t know what to call that shit (don’t know what to call it)
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit (don’t need it)
I’m a different breed with this shit (yeah)
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch (yeah)
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch (woo!)
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill' in one room (huh?)
You, you could ask anyone out here who running the game?
And they’ll tell you the truth, man, they tell you (and they tell you)
Oh look, they fuck with me now (hey)
I think they’re hearin' me now (yeah)
Someone said, "Nigga, they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like, "I think they just might be scared of me now" (might be scared of me now)
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day (every day), niggas wrong every day (true)
Gone, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe (nope)
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka, that’s grindin'


[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
(Grindin’, grindin’) Perfect timing
(Grindin’, grindin’)
(Grindin’, grindin’)
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Then peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
'Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out, they flew out
Invite 'em to my new house, my new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I’m grindin’

[Outro]
Twap, twap!
Twap, twap!
In the new house, we got the twap

[Intro]
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’

[Verse 1: Turk]
Ever since I came home from the pen
Been grindin' on my own and shit
Eight thou', seven-hundred sixty hour
YT puttin' all this shit
Real nigga, again the street fuckin' with me
Fuck a bitch nigga, got them red killers with me
Uptown nigga, let it bust
'Til it's if ya gettin' money is a must
But I'll stick it if you tempt me, so nigga don't tempt me
God don't do shit neither
Chopper worth of trouble, it's gone faster than a cheetah
Savor to the thuggin', I g'd up
Get it from the mud
I'm a thug, posted up like a meter
Stay strapped with the heater
I fuck pussy - pussy nigga, I don't need you
I'm grindin', me and my people
Puttin' in work like Amiga (Like amigos nigga)
Like Jeezy, I done seen it all
The feds askin', nigga I ain't seen nothin' at all
Swear I been nigga outside, ten time a hundred, nigga, one thou'


Grindin' for all my shit
Tryin' to build a house with one brick
Tryin' to fuck you, your bitch, and your clique
And no nigga, I ain't gave me shit


[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
The feds be spying on all of us nigga
These hoes be lying to all of us nigga
I got news for the monogamous niggas
Yo' bitch fucking anonymous niggas
I done seen it all my nigga
Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
Cause what’s the hottest shit on these corners?
That’s me and all my niggas
Grind for all this shit, I ain’t ever fall for that bitch
Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird
Is like a medicine ball to that bitch
We'll bring Gucci bag in this bitch
And you know what's stashed in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out
Like Janet Jackson and shit
I’m sweatin’ grindin’ this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven
Ain’t got time to bond with no bitch
Heard Jay Z got a new Cognac, where to find that shit?
The weed sticky, grind that shit
Where I got it from? Nevermind that shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
I got a new vision for all my shit
I don’t know what to call that shit
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit
I’m a different breed with this shit
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill in one room, you, you could ask anyone out here
Who running the game? And they’ll tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you
Oh look, they fuck with me now
I think they’re hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that’s grindin'
[Hook]

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
(Grindin’, grindin’) Perfect timing
(Grindin’, grindin’)
(grindin’, grindin’)
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Than peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out, they flew out
Invite 'em to my new house, my new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, grindin’

[Outro]
Twap, twap!

In the new house, we got the twap
“Grindin'” (word to Clipse) is the latest single from Lil Wayne’s upcoming album, Tha Carter V



[Chorus: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
(Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Ah)
Hermès link, ice-blue mink (Woo!)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is (Yah!)
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga (Woo!)

[Verse 1: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Yeah, October Firm in the cut (Yah!)
Stay at the top like I'm stuck, that's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax (Ha! Ha! Ha!)
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack (Yah!)
Virginia Black (Doo! Doo!)
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts? (Yah!)
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back (Blah!)

[Chorus: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Hermès link (Woo! Woo!), ice-blue mink (Yah!)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, out of the picture (Yah!)
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my—

[Verse 2: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
I'm so hot, yeah, I’m so right now (Right now)
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out (Ha!)
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note (Woo!)
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone (Baka)
I got a new mansion, 'cause I outgrew the condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through (Yah!)
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

[Chorus: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Hermès link, ice-blue mink (Yah!)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone (Gone, blah!), wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga (Woo! Woo!)
Yah!


[Verse 1]
She says, "Kiss me like you miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fuckin' someone else
Just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic, don’t I? I get it poppin’, don’t I?
I’ll end up stoppin', won’t I? And by the time I end up stoppin'
You’ll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out
While shoppin' with a nigga, don’t lie
She’s losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now

[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone


[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that you over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes: don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make
I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone


[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
She is here and we're so gone
Oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Round 1: Head ICE]
I took you cause you somewhat of a spokesman for all my haters
A out-of-town nigga that could be on the couch or in the bed
With one of my neighbors
He feel he got the scoop, but this ain't ice cream
I'll Math this man then hook, on ice cream
He thinkin Method Man 'n hook on Ice Cream
That's why you been Jerry in the circle nigga, no ice cream
So next time you're in your car, tune in I know why cats want to get at you
Your records wouldn't ship at a loading dock
You a nobody like Robocop
SP right only 2 liters like the soda pop
S-P-R-I-T-E 2 anyways
I volleybal your shit then go to the Nets game
You almost died cause a guy felt her thigh and it wasn't a guess game
You be trippin, but staying out of the helicopter route
Cause when we be tripping, we be bringing hella coppers out
Long choppers, clips like a Harley Davidson seat
Give you that loud ride to that place you should be
You a fruit loop with nutrition facts
Clips ain't spilling milk cause that wasn't the right house
He went to squab in the kitchen at
You got prostitutes, a Glock to shoot
'Lil white bitch that gives you lots of loot
How ironic you promoting that and her ex-boyfriend
The promoter is the one who sent you to the hospital
He's going to rap about my dick cause he prayed for my incarceration
But my (?) is his cousin
But you won't hear none of that in the bars he came with
Fuck boy, no day in jail
Took myself to the precinct, no Dave Chappelle
Cause I got 3 daughters nigga, I ain't take it well
But back to the gutter, you grabbed the clippers
When Charles Hamilton ran on you like you was getting a haircut
And that's the chair you rent out of the shop to make money in
Now that was some sucka, shit
When Charles Hamilton said some shit in his song
I ran down on him in the projects elevator like "fuck is this?"
So when it come down to who would do what
When a real man step to them, you and him a fucking bitch
You got no shame, used to be a first ave nigga with no fame
Muslim nigga who watch Soul Train
Grew up to date white women, so plain
You got Kevin heart on Soul Plane
If I give a bird, man to a young thug I'ma feel a 'lil weezy
About the whole thing
You asked Lush did he get shot at like you know the shooter
When Lush know a shooter that can get you shot at up close and sooner
You a body! No peace be with you brother Ahmed
Now take these shots! Arm leg a leg a arm head nigga
ICE!


[Round 1: Serius Jones]
You is family Ice
Now you old, fresh out of bars, and trying to be in Jones position
How ironic cuz
You got the swag of everybody’s uncle that just came home from prison
What up Wolf? They might’ve heard that terminology
But you ain’t break it down properly
So follow me to the Odyssey, back to the block with me
Eighth ave when my moms kicked me out, good thing my aunt a g
RIP, shoutout to Fat Cat, Bogod, Dre Solid b
That’s Wolf, means We Only Love Family, that’s the policy
So why is he, still throwing the Wolf up, well let's be honest g
You been backed up on the pack, let’s get all this shit out
This your colonic b
See you remember Drew Hamilton projects? 17th floor?
I was 17 when you was bagging that raw
In that cellophane, when we sell to fiends
And I was a nosey kid
But he was treating his nose, that’s what the homie did
See he made that work disappear
But you was like the Wizard of Oz and y’all know what a O-Z is
It’s a “O” so them kilos and biz is felonious
Cuz we know Jones is a OG so let’s think about how old he is
See I tried to help you when you was whipping that white girl
Meaning ya girl car
Then I took you from a local nigga to a world star
And what you do, typical, never stay in tune
Wolves don’t worry about getting outshined
You only howl cuz you jealous of the moon
They ask you who you came up with, you never celebrate ya goons
See ICE never say no names but catch em in interrogation rooms
Aww man, lord knows the G’s us
You act hard here boy, but you a hardware store, you made them keys up
He said he G checked T-Rex, please bruh
See Ice box but when it comes to them treys/trays he freeze up
It’s aight you know what I’m saying I do this cuz I got the cheat code
You about to get 84 gram’d, 3-0’s, lets go…


[Round 2: Head ICE]
Suck my dick! Straight like that
You don’t gotta make no funny sounds to get punched in yo face like that
We not in the United States, and you don’t know Drake like that
So after this battle if I decide to rob you
You don’t know where the precinct is, so I ain’t stressin a case like that
Nigga I let you taste a bat, or a chrome nozzle
Beat you with the back of a screw driver
In front of a bus full of kids and they school driver
Tell Tashim I miss her head
But if she ever play with me again I’ma send you her body
But it’s gon miss her head
Man miss me with irrelevant fake shit, I don’t take shit
Including pussy, I wipe my ass and doo doo mush em
Cuz to us it’s no clue you pussy
You almost got yourself killed in a fight scene in ya own movie
You ya own groupie
I make you choke yourself with ya own jewelry
Bitch nigga, Casino style
You and ya brother in a ditch nigga
Math punched you in ya face
And had you wandering around like the eye on ya cousin that’s a…
I need to see paper work
You riding around in a Benz like you a go getter
Promoting you got hoes and you a ho nigga
I get ya car washed and bullets will run through yo chest like these gold diggers
You a act who play it well
Have you in that black raised from cells
Cuz the first gat I raised was a gauge at the age of 12
What happened to you being Muslim? Newspapers and bean pies
It’s nothing ludicrous; they all knew you would pork out when it’s beef time
Gun under the shoulder like deodorant balls
You hear rapid barks like a Doberman dog
Then more barks like the owner ain’t home
Now you know that I’m a pet lover
The Desert Eagle will leave you but the Hawk'll be ya step brother
Step brotha, bloaw! Stepbrothers, cuz I give you all pops like step mothers
Ice will wet a nigga, you wanna buck it? Challenge
This silver will be under a star like it run with Dallas
Ask Tony Romo or any other street hooker or fag that know he homo
And you’ll see how much power behind these punches
Like watching boxing slo-mo
I should ox ya throat tho!
ICE! Nigga!


[Round 2: Serius Jones]
I know he got a voice like he still Sumos
But it’s funny to me cuz I know the real you tho
And dog is an old cartoon that ain’t been on in years
But y’all feel Pluto
See I been getting chicken and spinach since a squint in my Pop-eyes
You can’t do me greasy cuz I live oil but I still blew tho
See you a half steppin back stabbing nigga acting Big Daddy Kane
That’s why I’m able to kill you bro
See you sneaky though, like grimey in a bad way
You yell a lot but you never smoked nobody
So don’t be a menace when I use you as an ashtray
See you the type to give the little homie the pump
And then you gas em, petroleum and told em to dump
But I’m like damn wolf why you gassed the lil homie to smoke em?
He like “nah I told that nigga to stop holding the blunt”
My nigga you petty, Reggie and two start telly smelly
Never ready teddy, yeah you pender in the grass, just a Rob Kelly
Fruity, heard you using stems not the one from cherries
Yeah you got that Keisha but you buns, not the one from Belly
Chicken felonies, it’s weird charges, you can’t even tell what they mean
See I’m the bear and you the deer in this here forest, no hook
I’ll AR-AB through ya bars like Kareem
See they thought the swag was you
Nah it’s just what comes with 8th avenue
Ironic I used to watch you baggin up drugs
Now you getting drug while I’m baggin you
See you couldn’t be the plug
So you found a public outlet like ya phone died
For years you’ve been crying for me to peel ya onion
So I’ma cut you thick, the long kind
Do you greasy til ya skin starts to bubble and the foam rise
Yeah that’s how I’ma cook you
Since you claim you love her, love her home fries
You said out ya mouth on camera “Pat Stay so big
When I was in the elevator without a weapon I felt threatened”
On camera, I said “Head stop bitching!”
Then you told K-Shine “real killers can tell by the leg twitch”
No nigga, real killers keep shooting till the leg stop twitching
Yeah it’s alright though, I know how you said step brother
Cuz you 40 and still live with ya moms and you a pet lover?
What does that mean? I ain’t even gon go off the head on you
I’ma keep it cuz you said ya moms dead so it’s dead on you

[Round 3: Head ICE]
Foolio!
Now y’all see the difference between me and stupido
Making songs for the money but got famous off of beats without a studio
Speaking of studio, that’s your apartment size
Ya closet a port-a-potty
You can’t flush shit, just give me all you can find
I tell my niggas
Search all the Gucci, Jordan and Prada shoeboxes in the bathroom
Give me yo keys nigga, here search the car
Cuz them 4 doors and that trunk is the last rooms
All I heard was “I found it” I’m like “Cash? Drugs?”
They like “Both! And the coats hanging over the bath tub”
You a walking fake chain, every jeweler make you
I said you’ll walk in, fake, chain, every jew will make you
You got ya style from the lost and found, you ain’t schooling niggas
I could rent out my pad, I’m so super nigga
If I swoop a nigga, over his head, Campbells can
You lookin for souper nigga? Man to man
At my lowest lane you in an ambulance
I told you I was gon bar you, liquor shot
After this I’ma bar you, lick a shot
My boot-leg will run you out of the tenement spot
My bootleg run Serius out the tenement spot
Bars! The same one Bishop thought
He could save Blizzard from that owner pistol
You don’t own a pistol, now see these will burn through your tracks
That’s how I get on it with you
Line for line I’m dancing around em, no Soul Train
Cuz if I give a bird man to a Young Thug I’ma feel a Lil Weezy
About the whole thang
I let apes peel, ooooh baby, if you owed me a meal
I’ll be dead or a serial killer who got locked, worked out
Got so swole in the cage, I’ll really know how apes feel
But I kill 8 family members and we even
Wanna know how we straight? Build
After every murder there’s a family gathering plate
So fuck how my message taste, that’s 8 mills/meals
Jones in the wrong mission, this ain’t Indiana
In the end he Anna, Nicole Smith
OJ, they gon lock you up for stealing ya own shit
I give em the whole brick, y’all thinking 4 quarter kilos
In this house he fall asleep though for being a rat with a peephole
You Pookie belt
Take this nigga outside and kill him 3 times
You get the same murder Pookie felt
All you see is 3 9’s nigga, like the price of a teddy bear in a gift shop
I’ll let this go (Disco) in the club like the latest hip-hop
On that note, I don’t know who you wanna be, Cat Daddy
I’m mad you related to any of my sons, Cat Daddy
That’s his cousin, you heard him, Cat, Dre, Solid, you heard em
ICE nigga…

[Round 3: Serius Jones]
That was aight nigga
But from the audience response the hottest bar you ever said here was “ICE NIGGA”
You out here swaggin, but ya watch is falling off so how’s that real gold?
You in ya last round admitting you niggas rush cribs then steal clothes
For the fans that don’t understand, it’s incredible to expectation
Cuz in America it’s less debating
But if you a rapper or a street nigga getting money
The one thing you can’t afford is a federal investigation
Cuz just behind bars they pursuing niggas
Niggas acting like they with the shits but in they raps suing niggas
See I’m from Jersey, sure (Shore)
You can get found in a Surf just for (Tsu) suing niggas
I was like born with no arms, it’s like I got a body on my hands
See the guns I wave so big, Tsunami be like “Damn”
See you out of pocket, scrambling in the red zone
I made you think you made a play on me, b
Then I knock him out soon as he touch down
You know what that is? A KO-TD
Bars, when beef shells crack off easy
But at my peak I’m the guy yo, Taco style
And if I dip and then chip you, you gon here that just bitter nacho sound
See I never got beat up, I got snuffed
But you give the game a black eye for having Ice around
See I could’ve got a lump sum for Blackout
But you know when you put Ice on the knot goes down
You not a rapper, you a cancerous teacher
But you probably have a problem (Heisenberg?)
Now you on that Meth and can’t protect ya neck, I know you god (U-God)
You was probably on YouTube Inspecting the Deck
But you know I’ll cap a don (Capadonna)
But I got 36 Chambers to shoot at you through
And since you wanting to bring up Math
I’m just showing you the damage I could do with a Wu/Woo
They do pull-ups on my bars, this is lyrical exercise
If you wanna call this man a kin (mannequin)
Then we need to address my Ex
Her size will have you rollin like X
When I mark the spot I make em exercise
You giving work out the shop for hoes
I’m so lazy I never even ask my ex her size
See Ill Will Jamaican called me and said, “you wan rap with Ice?”
Make him smell the blade and get the accent right”
I said “hold up, cuz I don’t even use accents” right
And he said “no you see the axe that you use for Lyt
Well use the same axe ‘pon Ice
And then make him smell the blade so him can get the axe scent right”



[Produced by Boi-1da and Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, "Money over everything! Money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, "They miss the old Drake", girl don't tempt me
"If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do"
I'm like, "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Outro]
I be yelling out "Money over everything!"
"Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!"
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…

[Outro Poem]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better


[Verse 1:Drake]
I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ohh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No don't do it, please don't do it, cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Hook: Drake]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know, they know


[Verse 2: Einstein]
Bottles of whiskey, shout out to Fifty
And Jaekwon 'cuz after nine shots I'm feeling tipsy
I put on for my city, on for my city
So many meetings that my schedule is hella busy
Ah, I swear these women steady feeling it
Supermodels asking what the dealy is
I really is a superhero, Lois Lane, older women know my name
But 40 got me feeling so ashamed cuz I be dicking 'em, all
I swear these break lights are broke or something
That's why I know your older cousin
So when you're old and fussing
Ain't no reason I can't say I seen it coming
'Cuz when you're buzzing hating all of a sudden becomes a custom
Ah, I keep a couple bad women with me
The kind that don't mind splitting three O's like Griffey
Oh, I swear I'm feeling so spiritual
It's Einstein and I ain't even spit original
But they know

[Hook: Drake]

[Outro: Drake]
I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind
Tell 'em I apologized, happened over time, they know



[Instrumental]

[Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had

[Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it (I'm just sayin' you could do better)
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this (Tell me, have you heard that lately?)
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I (I'm just sayin' you could do better)
Beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same (And I'll start hatin' only if you make me)

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Drake]
I’m scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Say my name
Say my name

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Drake]
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me




[Verse 1]
All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'

[Chorus]
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

[Interlude]
What are we even doing?

[Verse 2]
Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
'Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him"
And I say "Well, goddamn"

[Chorus]
Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

[Outro: Dennis Graham & Drake]
All of this, it's alcohol, it's drugs, weed, it's everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot.  
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted…
They know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the heat of the moment. It's the heat of the moment and that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment.  
I agree
This shit, that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment. Be a 100% woman, or try and be a 100% man, and use a fucking condom
Haaa




[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love, call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing
Well, and I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing

[Post-Chorus]
Boy, what do you mean?
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don't want me to leave, then you tell me to go
When you wanna turn right, when you wanna turn right
'Cause we argue all day, makin' love all night
Oh, what do you mean?
Oh, and where are you now? Oh

[Bridge]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For ever breaking your heart
But when I called, you'd never seem to be home...

[Chorus]
So, why don't you call me on my cell phone?
Late night when you need my love, just call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing
Well, and I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing

[Post-Chorus]
Boy, what do you mean?




[Sample: Lil Wayne & David Letterman]
Is it true you performed with Willie Nelson at the Country Music Awards?
I don't know, but I know I did perform at this bad ass bitch birthday party recently. She was crazy, stupid thick

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mack in here
Pooh in here
Scoob in here with me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell ’em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I’ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down, then them hoes get passed up
Sittin’ on this money to me feel like a cactus
I’m stickin' to this shit, you would’ve been have hopped yo' ass up

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Tell 'em, I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty woadie
I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty woadie (Plenty woadie)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got hittas woadie, yeah I got plenty woadie
And they just wait for the word, this shit like Wheel of Fortune
Goddamn, these snitches nosy, goddamn, these snitches nosy
Nigga, I'm a ass with that semi; call me semicolon
Yeah I got hittas woadie, yeah I got plenty woadie
They kick the door and kill yo’ ass and leave the children snorin'
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, make me feel important
I made some green in the past and now it's good as golden, yeah

[Interlude: Katie Couric]
Clearly, Lil Wayne answers to no one

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I got hittas, woadie
I got, yeah, I got plenty, woadie (Plenty woadie)
I got hittas, woadie (Hittas woadie)
I got, yeah, I got plenty woadie

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Drake]
I'm so lifted, I'm so lifted
I wrote my will in hieroglyphics (In hieroglyphics)
Weezy, where you been? The people miss you
Crickets
I got hittas and they not kidders, that's my niggas
You got niggas but they not hittas, they got jitters
They get hit up, I'm placin' figures on your niggas
Takin' bidders, yo' bae, yo' niggas, don't make a difference
I got shooters, on pharmaceuticals​, they armed and brutal
Armed intruders, 'cause we don't doodle, we draw conclusions
I got sprayers, all type of sprayers, we gon' need Google
I got paper, on top of paper, we gon' need rulers
I'm effective, been doin' numbers since Roman numerals
Strong as sumo, we armed as usual, my hittas hungry
Charleston Chew you, bazookas chew you, just like Bazookas
Don't confuse 'em, we only hittas, y'all only humans
Don't get hit up, woadie (Hit up, woadie, hit up, woadie)
'Cause I got hittas woadie

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
He's a very smart child. And I just said he was a genius, you know what I'm sayin'? Which I used to pray, and ask the Lord to send me one. You know, he did. He's so smart, I can't teach him nothin'. He's done been here before

Young Money till the young boy dyin' out
You hear me cryin' out

And if your man get to stuntin’

Cause we be livin’ what these other rappers lyin' bout
Drizzy Drake, what
Funk Flex, uhh
Hot 9-7, I’m so far gone

Feelin' good, feelin' great, how you though?
Bet you hear my name every single place that you go
Sippin’ on pink shit, but nah it ain't Nuvo
Slow the F down 'fore yo ass is on Pluto
Tell me what it do
I belong to the youngest Grammy nominated crew
My city love me, but I got Toronto haters too
That sit around and talk about
What they’d have done if they was you
But know I ball without a sphere in sight
Club owners give me reasons to appear at night
And just know thatIbe in the mirror like
Are you listenin’? I hope you hearin' right
I’m in the Aston doin' doughnuts
I will kill the game and never send it my condolence
Taught to never love a chick and only love the moments
New York City, I can tell the people want it
Uhh, what you got for me flex, uh

[Verse 2]
Vacuum interiors and shined wheels
What's ya life like? This how mine feels
I like my seat back, I like my wine chill
I look good, smell better, and I rhyme ill
I say I’m at these girls neck and head
You and your girl sleep in separate beds
I killed this, tell Flex it's dead
You got birthday cake, mines weddin' tall
Y'all lemon small, y'all never ball
I get the girl of your dreams and I never call
NY, I got it, I'm bout whatever y'all
Yeah, 40 hears my interviews, tone it down
I’m at your girls condo gettin' shown around
Yeah, why you takin' everything personal?
This that in-ya-face, all-offensive-on-purpose flow
My city, never F’n need me
Yeah, oh wait no they really need me
Oh wait, hold up, Young F’n Weezy
Holla at me when you done F’n Weezy

'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out

Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
'Cause ever since I left the city

Hung with clubbers until you became one

Tell me exactly who's this person you've changed into
Maybe you've grown up, or I just didn't know ya
Please don't push me away, girl I'm just searching for closure
Let me dig alittle deeper, get alittle closer
Cause I knew you but the new yous taking over

You even changed on your friends
I catch myself thinking what we could of been

You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Hook: Gallant + together]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
(Come on everybody, stand up)
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge: Gallant]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Hook: Sufjan Stevens & together]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Outro]
Ever since I left the city…

Alright, let's see you do your best Drake impression
Something like this

And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing


She used to call you on your cellphone
Late night when she need your love
Call you on your cellphone
Late night when she need your love

I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when your hotline bling
It could only mean one thing

Ever since I left the crib, you, you
Started feeling sorry for yourself now
It's crazy how you had me feeling left out
And everybody knows you left me stressed out
Ever since I left the crib, you
Started caring less and going out more
Hanging with these girls all on the dancefloor
Chilling with these girls I never seen before
I never seen before

You used to call her on her cellphone
Late night when you need her love
Call her on her cellphone
Late night when you need her love

I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing


Ever since I left the crib, you, you, you
Don't seem to care about who  you with now
You got me feeling like I did you wrong
Going places that you don't belong
Ever since I left the crib, you, you, you
You got exactly exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your blackbook
Chilling with these girls I never seen before
I never seen before

I used to call you on your cellphone
Late night when I needed your love
Call you on your cellphone
Late night when you need my love

I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing

These days all I do is wonder if you're bending over backwards for someone else
Taking Patron shots with someone else
Doing things we did, getting freaky with someone else
You just need someone else, I can't be by myself
Oh, why you never alone? Always with these hoes
Used to be at home, be a good man, you were in the zone
You should just be yourself, right now you're someone else


She used to call you on your cellphone
Late night when she need your love
Call you on your cellphone
Late night when she need your love

I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing

You know the love that we shared
You know what we had was rare
You know the way that I cared
And  I gave up, you wasn't there
Niggas be lying, two at a time
I heard voice up in my line, line, line
I heard voice up in my line
Thought you were mine, so out of line, line, line
So, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

But I realized that you had a mustache
That you didn't want to shave
You could only ever go one way
So now it's one way and a done deal
So I run away, it's done, you're a seal
Not a marines type but a floppy one in the water
Bitch you need some new morals
I don't see why your hair was an issue
Did you just sneeze bitch atchoo, here's a tissue for you
Your hair was all coraled up bitch
And I hope you don't like this, I hope you cry to this

Into a ditch because of my clit like you

Bitch quit being rude, I know you need somebody in your life
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no

Baby, Baby, Baby Jesus
Baby, Baby Jesus
Gotta stutter when you say DaBaby

[Verse 1]
My phone keep on ringin', act like I don't see it
Your negative energy fuck up my vibe
Sending me threats, telling me you outside
Goofs in your high school to fuck up my ride
Said you did it again, said it is what it is
Scratching my shit, I go paint it again
Flatten my tires, I get bigger rims
That girl smile and I hit all her friends
And she know I'm a dog, I'm dog, I'm a dog
Worked real hard, finna take a vacation
I'd rather do this shit on my own
Don't give a fuck how much longer it takes me
I never fucked with these niggas before
I fuck with 'em now so they feel like I made it
Talking subliminal, this shit is pitiful
How they let that nigga feel like famous?
God damn, let's see act these niggas gon' act
Your bitch around me, it's a wrap

I'm gon' hit your lil' bitch from the back

They hating on John 'cause they all wanna be him
I really don't understand why niggas hating on me, all it took was some time and some patient
I got a whole lot of fine bitches waiting on me 'cause they know one day I'ma be famous
I got a whole lot of people that need me to feed 'em
They know that I got 'em, I won't ever leave 'em
I dropped out of college and start makin' more than my teachers

[Refrain]
Now all the bitches, they love me
And the niggas they hate me
'Cause they all wanna fuck me, woah, woah
As long as nobody touch me, we gon' keep gettin' money
We ain't worried 'bout nothing, no

[Verse 2]
Your girl might need some dick in her life
Don't even lie, she get in your ride
I pull out that dick and she know how to ride
Pull your seat-belt, I don't know how to drive
I treat your ho like a ho all the time
Never I wanted your ho over mine
Say that's a lie, but you know she be lyin', hey

[Verse 1]
Hey there, pretty girl
You know exactly what you got
And I don't blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the light's so bright
And the money's so right
And it's comin' in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in

[Chorus]
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in

And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go, "Hey now, now, watch her go down"
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone


[Pre-Chorus]
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
''Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

[Verse 3]
We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin', all-star weekend
One hotel room that all y'all sleep in
Housekeeper knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin' right all season
But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy


[Pre-Chorus]
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go, "Hey now, now, watch her go down"
Oh, oh, oh



[Intro]

[Verse 1: La Roux]
My heart it melts like plastic
I fell through the hole yesterday
Your smile pulled me in like elastic
I felt my mind detonate

[Hook: La Roux]
Oh, I've made mistakes
And you just say it's growing pains
When I feel ashamed
You tell me it's just growing pains

[Verse 2: La Roux]
We broke in two like a matchstick
It burns in my soul every day, every day
Your world was to me, so fantastic
And help seemed so far away, far away

[Hook]

[Bridge: La Roux]
When I'm crying out for change
You tell me it's just growing pains
Oh, I've made mistakes
And yes I know, it's growing pains

[Verse 3: La Roux]
The truth it feels like concrete
I drove into this wall yesterday
I wish I could be realistic
But my children, my dreams, went away

[Bridge: Drake]
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlantavegas (ay)

And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh


[Intro]
That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog

[Verse 1]
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?


[Interlude]
My heart belongs to you...

[Verse 2]
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

[Chorus]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
Girl, how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?


[Outro]
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Always knew I dreamt bigger than them big head ass niggas
Oh Yeah
Crazy how these hoes change now that my pockets got a little thicker
Stay down with me, shit ion know probably saw the bigger picture
Thuggin' like all my niggas, a problem I call my niggas
Remember I put errbody on the block list in my phone for yah
Remember when you far away in pain, I would drive in the rain for yah
Folks smell a little weed, know a nigga like me would take the blame for yah
Yeen give a fuck bout me back then, girl how bout now
Cause I'm off right now and you're stuck right now
Ooohhh, thought you had it all figured out, but I'm off right now and you're stuck right now

Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

Ayy, truck to the plane, to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
It's presidential suite, on deposit
Elevator up to the room

Shower up and then we hit the club
Touchdown, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green

Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you lead me in between?
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs'll look around
Find one that seem my type

That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes

I don't even know if she a wife
But I do know one thing though
Women they come they go
Saturday, through Sunday, Monday

Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunning for the title
Lot of people trying to take us viral

I'm just trying to have a nice night, though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, "Babe, I think there was a typo"
Nah girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that

It's gon' be a minute 'till I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past

You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show, to the shower, to the truck
Truck, to the club, for the party

You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watching
But I do know one thing though
Women they come they go
Saturday, through Sunday, Monday

Monday, Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no

Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

Skip 1 to 99, dime by dime real shit (Real fuckin Quick homie)
0 to 100 playa real quick (Real Quick)
Skip 1 to 99, dime by dime (Real fuckin Quick homie)

[Judicious]
That's the real shit, this ain't a fuckin race
But you can bet your dough on the run, it's a paper chase
I'll scrape and strafe every tree or wood, a waste of space
There ain't gon be a trace of vapor, great landscapers ace
My fuckin nuts are bigger than the squirrels taking grapes
Making apes bananas enough to go whine and rape a steak
Or maybe fucking pussy, make the gape that ain't at stake
For Heaven's sake, and Jesus Christ Judicious fuckin faint

Faint mother fuckin bitch
Why?
And watch your mouth man, jeez
Sorry

[Hook]
0 to 100 playa real quick (Real Quick)
Skip 1 to 99, dime by dime real shit (Real fuckin Quick homie)

Making apes bananas enough to go whine and rape a steak
Or maybe fucking pussy, make the gape that ain't at stake
For Heaven's sake, and Jesus Christ Judicious fucking faint
You won't see me fucking faint, must be huffing paint
Stuffing taints, cunt punt a pussy's pussy, puffin dank
Cuffing skanks to the fence cuz the cuff yo chick thing made me poke
The joking clown holding frowns in, found him upped to roughing pranks
I thought I timed my rhymes from time to timing
The rhyming, dining in alive I'm driving
Surviving, I'm striving and thriving arriving
At the hide, the hive we on Vivran jiving
I go 0 to 100 brotha real quick
I'm not a hero or gunner but I still spit
Getting dinero you a runner but I'm real quick
Always from 0 to 100 and it's real fuckin quick homie
Slick homie it kills when your pockets are thick homie
It ain't shit if you spit like this homie
You bitch phony, whipped and stripped like a bitch pony
Tripped and get kicked in the ribs this is it homie
You slipped and I'm pissed so I flick my wrist only
As thick as the mist when I rip the piff, toe me
The jist of this shit when I mix the mix homie
The notes DO TI LA SO FA MI and flip DO RE
My prospective needs a prospectus, my concepts is electric
Conceptions eluding the rudest electives
Electoral selections, selective on erect consensus
Your senses sense what the cents is, the scent
That I sent the dentures, meant what I meant in the tent
The dent ventures, adventing inventions
For adventurous adventures, demented
As the dementia repents the sense to mention
Rubber band man, in dubs or vans man
Clubs in the crammed stands, thugs in Grand Ams
Snug as a bug in a rug on the drugs he can't stand
Candy land, white candy damn handy man
Knock knock this ain't a fuckin joke
Handful of mushrooms like the toad in Mario
Bro if you ask me why'd the chicken cross the road
I just went and fucked his chick cuz he owed me dough, bro
Damn

[Intro: Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all (Damn)
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like


[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like


[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Drake]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright, yeah

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah

[Intro - Gwen Stefani]

And you're so sad. It's too bad. I wish you could've had what I had

[Verse 1 - Zin-Zeta]

All my bitches crave the riches which they THINK I have
They don't understand that
My money comes slowly and steady
And only if everyone throws me some pennies
For all these recordings they don't even let me know about
Until it's like the day before
At like four in the morning; it's surely annoying
I'm sorry, but corny and boring MCs
Are, like, always the first who want so much for free
And they swear that they're special and act like I owe'em
And try to make me think I'm lucky to know'em
But I'm lucky mama didn't raise a dummy
And that I can play it cool when they act funny
Because, at the end of the day, I still need'em
To keep me from going insane, so I feed'em
BEATS... and beats, and beats, But, I ain't stupid; I tell them "I don't sell'em; I lease'em."
I let'em make a hit from my sh*t, then hit'em up for my cut, till the sh*t gets weak, son
So what're your thoughts on that?
What're your thoughts of my thoughts on wax?
If you think I'm wrong, nigga, SKIP this song
But, if you feel me, nigga, sing along


[Chorus - Drake]

Hell yeah... hell yeah, hell yeah...
F*ckin' right... f*ckin' right, all right
And we say, "Hell yeah... hell yeah, hell yeah...
F*ckin' right... damn right, all right. (Yeah)

[Verse 2 - Zin-Zeta]

Nigga, what'chu want - new school or old school?
What the f*ck... you thought I couldn't do both, fool?
This whole hip-hop sh*t is a Cakewalk for me
So don't give me Reason to use ProTools
Most niggas got a lot of sh*t to go through
Before they get to me, and I don't even KNOW you
So, don't step outta line and get your whole crew shot
Bullets will heat up your stomach like soul food
Don't give me reason to go back to my old ways
I was herbin' niggas back in the old days
If they would ever try to come to me and act up
They got the top of their heads slapped. "Homie don't play... that."
Put a bullet in your wave cap
Push your finger-waves back, then grab your chick's ass
Make her gag on the dick, back and forth, quick-fast
Have her catch whiplash, then tell her to think fast
So what're your thoughts on that?
What're your thoughts of my thoughts on wax?
If you think I'm wrong, nigga, SKIP this song
But, if you feel me, nigga, sing along...
... Sh*t...


If you think I'm wrong, nigga, SKIP this song! But, if you feel me, nigga, sing along

[Chorus - Drake]

Hell yeah... hell yeah, hell yeah...
F*ckin' right... f*ckin' right, all right
And we say, "Hell yeah... hell yeah, hell yeah...
F*ckin' right... damn right, all right. (Yeah)



[Intro: Baka & Drake]
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I pull up on you in that purple thing
Bumpin' Purple Rain
Singin' "Purple Rain," sippin' purple rain
Pourin' champagne off commercial fame
You ain't worth a thing, you ain't gang gang
You ain't flame gang, you ain't same gang
It's my world, it's Wayne's world
It's a different world, it's D'wayne Wayne, oh Lord
Okay now we got some action
Fucking models out of Maxim
I'm too wavy, I'm what's happening
Okay now we got some rapids
Orange bottle full of tablets
Okay now we got some habits
Smokin' cookies, sippin' Acti
Okay now we got some balance
You see my team is right next to me
You don't see Tina right next to me
I thank her for takin' my breath from me
But the second me gon' be the better me
J.R. Smith with the shot
Cause I pull up, I stop and pop
I call my AK Barney and I'ma let this baby pop
Pull up on you like Steph Curry
With my foot up on you like eff worries
Been outchea since Keith Murray
Codeine got me with pink urine
So you know I don't have the energy
I fucked a bitch named Epiphany
My exes wanna be friends with my other exes
And I don't have the sympathy


[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

Dog off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her take a breather
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches, but money's over her
Cause money's under nothing, my life is such a blur

And any Young Money nigga I know would concur
Weezy talk to 'em!

[Intro]
Yeah
Oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Everybody said that you let me down
Hesitation bring the "you" around
Makes no difference what you used to do

[Chorus]
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I could never

[Verse 2]
Maybe you were reckless yesterday
I'm convinced you know a better way, I know it
Some would judge based on what you've been through but

[Chorus]
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I, I could never (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
You've told me things
Harsh truth to my face
I've been told to walk away (just know)
I could never
Things that I would choose to do with you if I had time though
Thousand times I fucked you in my mind, trust me I know

[Verse 4: Jorja Smith]
Everybody said that I let you down
And let the truth but I can still be found, yeah
Lost my way and only you were there

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Could you ever, yeah
Could you ever
Could you ever be ashamed of me?

[Verse 5: Jorja Smith]
Sometimes I ask how you could ever want me
How could you choose that you would ever love me
Yours were the truest eyes I'd ever seen
To be in a stare right back at me

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Could you ever
Could you ever
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Could you ever

[Outro: Jorja Smith]
Why can't you ever


[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, ayy

[Verse 1]
It was meant to happen, the most trusted going triple platinum
Link with Mac, link with Fee, if I'm down in Baton
Link with Tez, link with C, when I'm down in Jackson
Just got back, overseas I was the main attraction
This ain't them, this is me, so you know what's crackin'

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I mean there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I've got to make it out"

[Chorus]
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instrumentals
That's how I paid the rent
LA, at a big event
Been ten years, niggas hated him, now they cavin' in
Now, wait a minute

[Verse 2]
I mean maybe I'm confused, 'cause I thought that we was enemies, yeah
The big you is like a mini me
Like big view, man, I'm a legend in my city streets, yeah
Niggas peep, I wrote this shit while I was whippin' streets
Like fuck the law, I dropped Adonis off and pick a beat, yeah
Ballin' by the beach, like Miami Heat, yeah
Presidential suites, we don't get impeached
I talked to God standin' up straight, I don't get on my knees
That isn't me, that's not the person I was raised to be
Just wait and see


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shit is jumpin' in my bank account
You know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I've got to make it out"

[Chorus]
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instrumentals
That's how I paid the rent
LA, at a big event
Been ten years, niggas hated him, now they cavin' in
Now, wait a minute



[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Thank God for the first nigga to start trapping
Thank God for the first nigga to start rapping
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping

Trigger finger, keep itchin'
Well I'll pull it, I'll do it, yeah

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz & All]
Yeah! Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified

Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' out the telly
My nigga did a dime and he back already
Got that sack already, man we got them racks already
As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already
I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already
Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already
Three niggas with me, me myself and I
God don't like ugly, you should testify
My T-shirt come from Bergdorf
I make so much on a verse I take the third off
Bird call, swerve off
Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off
Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Thank God for the first nigga to start trapping
Thank God for the first nigga to start rapping

Well I'll pull it, I'll do it, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake, Lil Wayne, Both & All]
Drank in my cup holder, hope this shit don't spill
Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill
How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill?
I have no imagination, everything I do for real
Bitch I'm camouflaged, down put your camera phone down
If she got a ass and the girl a fan, it's going down
I'ma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it
In the bedroom forever, that's what her roommate will tell you
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you
He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa
Tell 'em come to the cribbo and do them both, double dribble
I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her
Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos
I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes
(Tunechi) That's just how my OG would sum it up
I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up
It's just me and 2 Chainz, but the chain's never tucked though
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga fuck y'all

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Thank God for the first nigga to start trapping
Thank God for the first nigga to start rapping
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping
And I'ma have to keep it muh'fuckin' real with 'em
I got a problem, with these niggas
I got a problem, with these bitches
Trigger finger, keep itchin'
Well I'll pull it, I'll do it, yeah

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne & All]
Well, if you know like I know, that pussy pop like pyro
And she know I'm a pothead, that pussy like a pothole
I’m colder than a snotnose, man all these hoes is my hoes
And if she bougie, fuck her once then leave her hanging, dry clothes
I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in
Niggas lying, they pretend, don’t cross that line, it's paper thin
High as a star, make a wish, I’m a shark, I ate the fish
I got no heart, I hate that bitch
You hate that bitch? Well I hate that bitch
Will jump a nigga like a chessboard
Do a drive by while you riding on your skateboard, uh
They ain't even know it
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Then I take her to the crib, man, fuck that bitch right on the step
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out
Hair-Hair Weave Killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the ga-game coach, I'm the antidote
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money, and the dope
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane, and a boat
I am so cold, I need a cover, and a coat
Kick it at the mall, call it football
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

[Outro: Quartet]
(Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3)
Right now it's me time
(A little time for myself y'all) Me time
(Oh yeah) Right now it's me time
(Don't want no one else now) Me time
Bitch please don't call my phone (don't call my phone)
Said I wanna be left alone (be left alone)
Please, please don't stop by my home (stop by my home)
No, no cause I feel it's just a matter of time
'Til you people make me lose my mind
I'm 'bout to leave this world behind, yeah, yeah
Right now it's me time
(You need to go kick rocks now) Me time

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do

[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
I said now what it is, what it do, homegirl ain't got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up, flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm
And everytime you give it to me it’s gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets you’re gon’ be my lucky charm


[Chorus: Young Jeezy & JAY-Z]
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
Man, that boy so cold, give him a blanket in here

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I d-o, I d-o, I d-o, oh, oh
I, Vito, promise to treat this game, i-de-al
Honor the code, not bring drama to mama’s peephole
Life’s a bitch but she's the only love that I know -ow -ow
So la-a-dee, after the “I Do’s” lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby
Looking back, I don’t know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And til the task force roll
To hug her every corner til I get ash from the cold
Or until I’ve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever
Your secret’s I treasure, for better or worse
You’ll always be my first love til death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up


[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do

[Verse 3: Drake]
I do, I do, I do, I do
Unh, Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC Hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know I'm just a boy that a woman could make a man of
So make me one, I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when she's 81
Please don't give it all away, I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around, there more jaded that they become
But this one special, so I make sure my suit will fit
The one my daddy wore in June of '85, I'm too legit
I'm just tryna get her in the mood
And having her doing all the things she'd only do when she get married
So let's do this shit
Tell the reverend, all we missing is his blessing
Because before she popped the pussy, she need me to pop the question
So we exchanged vows, they clapped, we take a bow
And she'll be doing tricks for daddy, when we take it to the house...


[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy

(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do

I said I do I do I do I do I do

[Verse 4:  André 3000]
Nothing's more attractive than a heavy praying woman
To a him when those and them been defecating on me (ughh)
Her would sense the heaven, and him when Andre omen
Baby I’m hell, save me, don’t bail
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like like "love"
"Friend," "rock star" and "So and so’s a genius"
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooohh momma’s sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit ain't gon’ fall too far from tree
So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil’ cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby, she’ll be nerdy make the whole club swoon

[Interlude: André 3000]
She'll love books and cook and look just like you
And when she's done being young, she'll dress like you
We'll call her Love 22, she'll tote a 22, the laser version

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do



(Uh)
Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know that I'm just a boy that a woman can make a man of
So make me one, I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when she's 81

So we exchange vows
They clap, we take a bow
And she'll be doing tricks for daddy
When we take it to the house




[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, shit's all good
The deal got signed, and my split's all good
And these haters pretending that it's all good
Say that shit in person man, I wish y'all would
I'm a motherfuckin' genius, goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed, then the slightest could have fooled me
Yeah, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname's "Starter Drake"
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen, I could draw attention
But you could tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like

[Chorus: Drake & Belly]
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie (Drake)
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie

[Verse 2: Belly]
Here I go, street reaper
Ballin' over here, we need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house looks something like a resort
You can't resist bein' rich when you record
When this money runs slower than Eeyore
If your life is a movie, you a extra
I'm so fly, I glide: Clyde Drexler (wooh)
Mister pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now, fuck next up

[Chorus: Drake & Belly]
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie


[Verse 1]
Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We should've did this already
Said I got a email today
Kind of thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely

[Chorus]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely

[Verse 2]
Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely


[Chorus]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I get lonely too
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely


[Outro]
I get lonely
I get lonely
Just like you



[Intro: Drake]
Boy Wonder

Drizzy

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I get money
I get paper
I get girls all different flavors
I buy Gucci, I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar
I get money
I get paper
I get girls all different flavors
I buy Gucci, I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar

[Verse 1: Drake]
Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket of my pants
I still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records all you sing ghost
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich while you stayin' broke
Chillin even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through a Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch when you throw me high fives
They try to measure up but there is no one my size
Whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes
Beast mode on em, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I get money
I get paper
I get girls all different flavors
I buy Gucci, I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar
I get money
I get paper
I get girls all different flavors
I buy Gucci, I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar

[Bridge: Kevin Cossom]
I'm the rookie of the year (Year)
About to get my dough on
I'm about to take off, baby you should hold on
But I ain't about to prolong
I'ma keep it short and tell you what's about to go on
Bottle after bottle cos the money like so long
Baby... We about to put a show on
I'mma show off, like I'm supposed to
Yeah you can get lost, I don't know you

[Verse 2: Drake]
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't picking up an' entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmmm
I cannot relate
Riding with some tags that I got from outta state
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space
Just show me who's the hottest I'mma knock 'em outta place
Call me "Homicide Drizzy", I'm about to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goodie like I'm Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While a Houston stripper pole dance in a Z-ro
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-Pass is as valid as can be
I'm, I'm so fresh the stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she smiling back at me

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I get money
I get paper
I get girls all different flavors
I buy Gucci, I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar
I get money
I get paper
I get girls all different flavors
I buy Gucci, I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar

[Outro: Kevin Cossom]
Louie too
Yeah, Alexander McQueen
I'm so clean
It's KC and Drizzy
And its the remix, remix
C.O.S.S.O.M
Haha




[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, "Fuck the world with a long dick!"
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her?
Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read?
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Woo, Young Mula, baby
Yeah


[Intro: Trey Songz]
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
This goes out to the beautiful girls
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Which one of y'all, which, which one
Which, which one of y'all
Which one of y'all going home with Trigga?

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I see you in the club, ooh, shawty
Walking past a nigga looking at me all naughty
Then I said, "Baby, wassup?"
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug
Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil buzz
Up in VIP with all my thug niggas
You leaned over and said you want me
Girl, when the valet pull the Benz up
Off to the crib, shawty, where we gon' end up
Girl, sit back, relax, hold up
Let me turn the radio on

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl, when I get you to the crib
Upstairs to the bed
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex


[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Put the code in the gate, pull up to the driveway
Said she like the way I touch her, listening to Usher
I got a confession
Now we 'bout to sin, but your body is a blessing
Father, forgive me
Girl, can we take it up stairs? My bed's waiting there
All I wanna do is is give you all of me
Won't you give me all of you?
I want your body like right now
You know I live a Magnum lifestyle
Baby, turn the lights down and I'mma turn you on

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl, when I get you to the crib
Upstairs to the bed
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex
'Cause I do it like I think
You gon' think I invented sex


[Verse 3: Drake]
All right
It's a celebration clap, clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of Moscato
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl,  you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it
Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl, when I get you to the crib
Upstairs to the bed
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex


[Outro: Trey Songz]
Now who's coming home with me?
Tell me who's coming with me
I wanna know who's coming home with?
Tell me who's coming with me
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Uh-huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
On these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard


[Verse 2: Drake]
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard


[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenants
And if I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfuckin' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' wit it
She said "I seen it all", I say "No you fuckin' didn't"
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "Bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse:]
The clock that you've been watching has been stoppin
He makes you wait, what kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me I promise my hands will say

[Chorus:]
They'll say
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarms
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Think about the last time I came through
I had something more than a gift for you
And I don't only fuck you like that on your birthday

Baby I just landed
Bout to get my bags and all I needs an address
And I'm on my way

Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Cuz I'm on my way (2x)

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Drake]
I get 'em up! (I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (Fuck it, I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (I said I’m on one)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like "what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "Fuck it, I’m on one"

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya "everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say "cheese" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel tov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence
(Young Mula baby, YMCMB)

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
I get 'em up
I get 'em up
I get 'em up




[Intro: DJ Khaled & Drake]
I get 'em up! (I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (Fuck it, I'm 'on one)
I get 'em up! (I said I’m on one)

[Verse 1: Wale]
Ambition
Two white cups and I got that drank
Two dyke jawns but tonight they straight
Redbox flow and I do not date
Real G shit I don't use no cape
I get my cake; I love hip hop
J Cole, Don Trip, Drake, Big Sean
Nigga wanna act we can get improved, bread on me that's a garlic knot
Tats out and my hair long, loud shit, Weird noise
Like B.o.B., Got airplanes, not one J, got a pair or more
Folarin bitch realest nigga in this ho
Shoutout to them niggas who still fuck with me at Interscope
My ambition to blow
This is why I'm in this fo
Women at my pole
This is oh so much like getting votes
I make her kitten moist, this is why her nigga mad
I just give her bigger O's, he just get her bigger bags
I'm an asshole, so what my bitches like it?
I'm why she get excited
You why she buy devices
Tightest writer to write it, dopest flower to quote it
I'm zonin; I'm out Seattle with Little Cheyenne and Tony
What up?

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care 'bout is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said, fuck it, I’m on one

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
(Kirko Bangz)
Uh, I'm feeling so throwed
I done had this drink since I was 15
And now I'm finally getting on
Told you bout this shit when I was 18
And fuck it, I'm the new nigga
Don't give a fuck bout how these niggas rate me
Ya girlfriend wanna cruise with us
But I'mma need a badder bitch to date me
Uh, I got this money in my pocket
I won't throw it 'less she dropping
Know what? Fuck it, bitch go shopping
See I always keep it cocky
Cause these niggas wanna doubt me
Talking numbers like a auction, fuck yo Porsche and yo bugatti
That you always talk about, but I dont never see you driving
Cause you know that nigga's hungry, and you looking at a lion
I'm the fucking last king, eating dinner with the mayans
Yeah you riding for yo city, but I'm driving
BITCH!

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Sliding with some hoes, as long as that she's 18
Tryna play it safe, tryna stay up out the state green
Big chain drippin down
Everyday same shit, but when I look back, shit different now
Ridin with the same niggas til the death of moi
Coke boy, Montana, you niggas know the repertoire
Uhhn, That street shit, we live boy
That, that, that, you might, not be here next year boy (ARRGHH!)
Got that drink, might be brown, might be white

Fuck a deal, Indy boy, Two chains, Tity Boi
Like, like, like, whats up with your best friend?
Drinkin Henny straight cause a liver cost ten grand
Houses on my left hand

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care 'bout is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said, fuck it, I’m on one

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
I don’t know what these haters be talking, I pop any chick that I want
Put your girl in the back of that ‘Bach, main two reasons she ain’t gone front
I minaj with her and her friend, put my main homie on one
But my neck and wrist so stupid, and my pockets be on so dumb
Because I’m on one
Haters we never condone em
Penthouse full of some bad bitches, me and my homies gon show em something
It’s MMG
Ridin round in this Lambo, goin ham dog on Collins
And I’m leaning off of that purple shit, so don’t judge me like your honor
I’m feeling so cold
Yeah we riding dirty but the whip clean
But think a couple years ago
I was in a cell when I was 18
And whats up with these new bitches, and why they all wanna fuck so easy
And whats up with these new niggas, and why they all wanna talk so greasy

[Verse 5: Tyga]
All these niggas stealing swag
I've been getting tats since I was fourteen
Tell my bitch throw it in the bag
Twenty-two for the Balmain jeans
I'm smoking these niggas they needing nicotine
Rat race, first place famous like a Kennedy
All my diamonds lemonade
Hearts stay below degrees
Too many bitches marry them all, #polygamy
Make a waterfall, Yosemite
Highest underrated nigga, I don't need you rating me
Sold out shows way before this shit was BET
Knocking at my front door, bitches trying to peek and see
Last Kings, YMCMB you know the team
Just counted fifty thou in my Waldorf suite
Man, this life's too fucking easy
Ferrari red all over, call it Santa bleeding

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care 'bout is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said, fuck it, I’m on one


I started from the bottom now im over here. Lookin down at my peers. Nigga they show respect which is why they dear. To me. Nigga I dont know how im suppose go on top without them. Nigga I rose from the grown like a seed to a stem. I know to me they a gem. Worth more than M's. I ain't gotta worry about no price. Nigga all I have to say is words are worthy like the lyrics I write. I know this game was out my reach. But now im over here making these rappers preach. I never talk cheap. Its a foreighn language to me. Like me speaking worthy. Its more money than shots of stephen curry. Because I dont give a fuck if these haters judge because they ain't my jury. I spit clean but my lyrics stay dirty. I never stop in the middle of my streak I finish fast like im in a hurry. I steal the show like a california burglary. I never lend to these haters. And nor will I offer. Like a new roster. I have little kids looking up to me like a for father. Because I started from the bottom now im over here. This is my year. Like I say every year. If you didn't hear. I ain't in the grammies yet but these fans give me a cheer. My goal is to be on top of the charts farther than the atmosphere. Im breathin in love lettin out the hate. After this mixtape. I will be called official the great. Im that nigga you will find a legend in my character trait. Like when the knicks had nate. Stuffin yao ming was just the beginning. Pretty soon you will see all these rappers loosing and I be doing is winning. I may be only a sophmore but in hip hop I'mma schola. Yo boy bring hip hop back like puttin hydraulics in a 6 4 impala. You new B's wouldn't understand. You think bitches shake it for you with some bands. We make em dance without dollars boy they hear our lyrics and its far more advanced. A higher level. I started from the bottom im over here. Later I'mma be on the highest peak of my career. Enough said I made these haters kiss my rear

[Drake]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I'm ready for ya

Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soakin in your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better

You say you wanted fast? Define fast

And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed

Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed tooPlus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South

[Intro]
Yeah
Alright
Paige, I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind me, uhm havin' a little fun you know?
I know this your joint I just I always liked this song so I figured I may as well throw in
Here we go

[Chorus]
I'm still fly, (Yeah) I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings (Ah)
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand 'em (That's me singin' by the way)
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing (In case you didn't know)
I'm still fly, (Yeah) I'm sky high (It's some new shit, it's some new shit I'm on)
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings (I promise I got 'em though)
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around (Love)
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing (Here we go)
I'm still

[Verse]
Responsible for everything you listen to, a mediocre talent, let me see if I can condition you
Took over my city, and I never asked permission to
Started poppin' bottles, cause it's ATL tradition to
Celebrate with Bob Ma, fuck him at the So-ho
If there ain't an elevator in it, it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin', and these bitches wanna snow blow
And they just give me head, while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ should've won that
Listen and respect, man, the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, halla at me when you're done laps
Roll around with Neego, Party with Azooka
Shout goes out to 1Da, shout goes out to Future
Shout goes out to Getti, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch, just can't seem to hold it steady
'Cause I see the flame flickering, x girls bickering
Got these women jockin' me from Holly Grove all the way to Picker Ring
I tryed to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan, but my connect said it'd take a minute if you listening
Please start doing you, I been doing me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody, even if you suin' me
My brother P-rain know, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot an officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hopin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just halla if you got me, fuck you if you had me
Shout goes out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver, and 40, man, you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to B Plus
The names I mention are crucial, you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes, I could sacrifice a line
Yeah, I swear, I really fuckin' does it
I had these niggas trippin, no luggage

[Chorus]
I'm still fly, I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand 'em
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
I'm still fly, I'm sky high (Yeah)
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
I'm still




[Hook: Drake]
I'm still fly; I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try and cut my wing
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly; I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try and cut my wing
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still...

[Verse 1: Page]
Clean in this bitch I'm feelin' myself goddamn a nigga rich
And every time I touch it guaranteed to be hit
And when them checks come guaranteed to be a split
I'm flyer then an invitation
Like I'm the information
Toronto's been waiting and I'm glad ya'll been waiting patient
But I'm here now these niggas is old news
I mix cocaine powder with the pro tools
(Whip it) Yeah crack that's just how I double back
Yoropiko Jeans bleeding on them white air max
And these niggas keep asking me when you gon' drop
Why the fuck you still harassing me when's that gon' stop
I guess its when my albums selling in the stores
And they sayin' damn I use to know the boy
Now I barely see em
And the little kids wanna be him
He a star now look up you'll probably see him

[Hook]

[Page]
Fly as I wanna be kush in the air I get high as I wanna be
S 550 navigatin' where I gonna be
P.A.G. mother fucker don't forget the E
Rep T dot till they bury me
Audemars the wrist red diamonds in the necklace
Been getting' checks while you rappers stay checkless
Real street nigga feel free to do a checklist
They don't really make em like me
Had to give you a second to breathe
Nigga ballin' still a hobby and I do that with ease
I'm bout to catch pneumonia because my neck stay freeze
I'm in the west indies
A 100 grand on a cheap white tee
I'm the man in my city they demand at me
Nigga I rep for my city like a football team
I'm fly like the New York Jets be
In a G5 two nines on me like Wayne Gretzky

[Hook]




[Intro: Future]
Draped in all designer, draped in all designer
Draped in all designer, draped in all designer

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Pink slip sitting in the dashboard with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really, ayy

[Verse 2: Future]
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
I dropped a few whoop-da-whoops in my cup
Put it on my tab, put her on my tab
Franchise tag on me, Bron Bron
Steph Curry wrist, nigga, Oakland
Perkies for the bitch in Magic, Don Juan
Standing ovation and an encore
And I keep a check, Nike Concord

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Pink slip sitting in the dashboard with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really, ayy

[Chorus: Future]
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug

[Verse 3: Drake]
Whole time, I was ready
They was like, "Hold up, wait a minute"
I was like, "Nah, nigga, let's get it"
This that OVO Halloween gang, you know how I'm rocking already
If you come here tryna take somethin', there's a lot more where that came from
And it really ain't no thang, I got Summer P in this thang
I just dropped a jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings
Yeah, yeah, up and away
Y'all should have seen this shit comin' in May
We doing three hundred records a day
Who really think they can get in the way?
Nah, nah, niggas is bitter, they hurtin'
Look at the business mergers
Throwed back when I'm swerving (Skrrt)
Big body my Suburban
Everything I do on purpose
I'm blowin' up like it's urgent (Brrt)
And she was actin' like a virgin (Nah)
I gave it to her, then I curved her

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Pink slip sitting in the dashboard with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really, ayy

Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug

[Intro]
Yeah
I'm working on dying

[Chorus]
I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

[Verse 1]
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

[Chorus]
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check

[Verse 2]
You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

[Refrain]
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)
Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

[Chorus]
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)

[Outro]
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know (That I know)
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho


[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I’m so fuckin dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs
There’s a diamond on my dick so there’s a diamond on her tongue
I can’t feel you baby cause I'm romantically numb
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come
There’s nothing under God's sun that I haven’t done
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn’t one
Girls are like buses every 15 min they run
Now they like potato chips I just can’t have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don’t like your friends in my business
And I feel like you don’t deserve a visit
Cause you ain’t in the kitchen when you want a whipping

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, ok I’m all about it, all for it
I’m all star team Jordan, small forward
I’m never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I’m shooting if I draw for it
Pow, Pow, fuck is up, naw man I’m in this ho
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I’m in it for
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me
Wondering if I’m the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna fuck you, niggas gotta wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just don’t believe you


[Hook: Drake]
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you

[Verse 3: Sean Garrett]
Ain’t that your girl
Ain’t that your money
Ain’t you the same nigga that say she want you that you funny
Ain’t you a gangsta, yeah funny
You gave em funny, gave you to you, fucking dummy
Classic line, bitches run like buses
Gucci say niggas asking why, why you with my girl
She let me get it nigga
She ain’t stupid, go turn up your radio
I’m the next young Lionel Richie
I gives a fuck about doing a fucking cameo
We don’ love em, we don’ love em, we don’ love em, NO!
They just love us, they just love us, cos we stack them O’s
Cos we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
Thats gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don’t go

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you

[Instrumental]




Mademoiselle Industrie m'boude, me traite d'insubordonné
Dit qu'j'suis pas rentable quelque soit l'support donné
Je suis en marge, elle m'appellerait Iverson Allen
Car j'fais partie d'ceux qui disent "non"
Comme le suggère Wallen
Plume à Scandale est un souvenir mauvais dit elle
Elle veut du rap spiritueux, pas spirituel
Mauvais souvenir car j'ai mis Jésus dans l'mix
Mauvais souvenir comme l'année 2015 des New York Knicks
Elle menace de m'faire la guerre parce que j'suis pas conforme
Mais rien qu'le stylo ma Bible et moi
C'est une armée qu'on forme
Le rap est sale, j'le dépoussière et passe la serpillière
En plus de ça j'aspire à rendre Molière fier
L'hiver est rude, les caisses n'ont plus de cash
Mon compte se vide à vue d'oeil, le portefeuille est lâche
Et c'est là que Mademoiselle Industrie passe à l'attaque
Et elle m'dit : "Le rap ça paye, il remplira ton sac wesh !"
Offre alléchante j'avoue, elle veut du son qui pète
Des basses lourdes, des refrains light à chanter à tue-tête
Mais j'ai dit "non"
Calme, déterminé, serein
Puis si tu veux du son qui pète il y a William Saurin
Oh Lord, j'veux pas qu'on dise que l'rap que j'fais s'perd
Je prends la main, y'a pas qu'au hand qu'on voit des experts
J'écris des rimes qui tuent en série comme Dexter
Et j'fais planer l'auditeur, Clyde Drexler
Mademoiselle Industrie et moi c'est
Juste impossible car j'aime pas les chemins déjà tracés
Les rimes déjà faites, les thèmes prédéfinis
Trois morceaux à la radio et puis après t'es fini
Moi j'ai mis style en 2 et substance en 1
Et si j'ai l'2 en 1 j'vais pas m'plaindre, c'est encore mieux hein ?
Mais c'qui est sûr c'est que j'me plierai pas aux exigences
D'un marché qui veut qu'on danse mais qu'on ne pense plus...




[Intro]
I need to know, how many people out here tonight, Fayetteville, have been fuckin' with me from day 1 I need to know
I'm talkin' 'bout when a nigga was passin' his mixtape out the fuckin' mall and shit
He like, "you passed me one, nigga"
I'ma do this shit ion' care if there's only like 5 or 6 people in here that know this shit I don't give a fuck
I'ma do this song for anybody out here tonight that got this shit that I dropped called The Warm Up you know what I mean you gon' fuck with this shit
Or even if you got this shit that I dropped called Friday Night Lights, you gon' fuck with this shit
Now listen, I know a lot of people here, been fuckin' with me for a long time
But a lot of ya'll, you know this might be the first album you fuck with, or the first show you ever came to so I gotta set the scene for ya'll, I gotta let y'all know somethin'
This shit been a long journey it was not always like this
It was not this many people
I'm bout to take ya'll to a time
Way before we had these fuckin' fancy ass fuckin' LED lights and shit
I don't even know what the fuck LED lights mean, but I'm payin' for them bitches
Way before we had this fuckin' cool ass stage and shit, we ain't had to shit like this
And definitely way before we had this stupid fuckin' ridiculous, expensive, blue for no fuckin' reason video wall behind me
We ain't have no shit like this man
The only thing we had- the only thing we had was classic shit like this

[Intro to “Lights Please“]

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Sing!

[Verse 1]
I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on Bragg boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please

[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please
Sing!
Turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

[Intro to “In The Morning“ ]

Ah shit
2,6 sing
Hey can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you moanin'
Huh, up top!

[Verse 1]
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Ay would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Chorus]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Sing
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', moanin', moan...

[Intro to “Nobody's Perfect“]

[Intro]
Hey!
Cole world
Fayettenam sing this shit!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is for all the fans...
[Crowd]
That waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
[Verse 1]
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like- Hands up!
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing
Sing!

[Chorus: Missy Elliott, J. Cole and Crows]
Nobody's perfect, sing!
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Say what?
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, right side, hands up
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh

All of this grindin' for what?
It’s funny when you niggas thought it was luck
I cannot give you a pass if you play with my money and family and friends
And I compete with myself while you niggas competin' with trends
Your foreign is used, I looked up the VIN
I know the truth, no use in pretendin' with him

[Chorus: Drake]
Still in the cut, The Boy in the cut
Hop in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
And I'm way up at the top of the loft
Gotta stay up, ain't no knockin' me off
Pull up smooth, A.I. with the cross (Haha)
Countin' up wins on wins on wins, for all of my dawgs I lost
I might call Pharrell, get the new Chanel
Thugger got the YSL, huh
I remember when the Feds did the sweep, I pray my dawgs didn't tell, huh
Cruisin’ down Biscayne
I was in Miami, she gave me top with the top off
Cartier wrist gang, got her a Audemar
She got the head, knock your socks off
You ain’t gettin' money, you ain’t fuckin' with me
You ain't in your bitch top five
I might pull up in the Six with Drizzy
I was just in Houston, fuckin' with the mob ties
We don’t never ever play two sides
Hang out the Phantom, it's suicide
They ridin' my wave like a rogue tide
My necklace is wet like the poolside


[Chorus: Drake, Drake & Roddy Ricch]
Still in the cut, The Boy in the cut, yeah
Hop in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'


[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin' through the drapes and we both yawnin'
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin'

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, the Sun risin' while you moanin', baby
Can I hit it in the mornin', uh?
Can I hit it in the mornin', yeah?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'


[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about
Tomorrow you'll be callin' out
'Cause tonight we gettin' right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warnin'

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', yeah



Oh did you ever
Feel like life is
Just a tough situation?
Trust me you'll find yourself
In a field in the middle
Of the night. Why?

'Cause it's time
For night fun
Yeah, you can't forget it
Sun's never gonna
Come up if we just
Party all night

Y'all know what it feels like
To party all night, right?
So let's get this started!
I'm never gonna regret this
Except for you, you, you

One big fan of Drake
Walked into the field
And said "hello"
I just don't care
How y'all react

Nightime party for
The whole time
Yeah, y'all are invited
Nighttime party for
The whole time
Sorry but you gotta come

No one in the world
Is allowed to skip it
'Cause it's filled with fun, yo!
You can get on the carousel
Or maybe just have a free campout

No one can skip it
My rules, you follow
This isn't payback
One possible answer-
Imma do this every night!

Nighttime party for
The whole time
Yeah y'all are invited
Nighttime party for
The whole time
Sorry but you gotta come

As the sun rises up
The party disappears
Until another night
Yo, you can't stop it
If I were you

Yo you can't stop it
If I were you

You you can't stop it
If I were you




[Chorus]
Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that you're comin' home intoxicated, ooh
So you better take your time with me
'Cause I remember last time you wouldn't make love to me
Think you fell fast asleep (I hope you niggas sleep)
Wouldn't even talk to me now

[Verse]
Say, say I'm so crazy, baby
I wanted you to race my mind
I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to erase my mind

[Open Verse]


[Spoken Word: Drake]
You see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom. After this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm. What you got?Comeback

[Intro]
Yo, what's going on? This is Drake
And I'ma let you know what you about to witness
This right here is a Drake and DJ Smallz collaboration
So I'm from Canada, my man's from down South
Ya understand, the number one DJ in the South to be exact
You heard that in the VMAs, you heard that wherever he goes
My man Smalls is out there, down south
Same time, reppin' for Toronto, Canada
Ya know what I mean?
So this right here, listening to right now is the official Southern Smoke Special Edition
I call it the "Room For Improvement" mixtape, cause I'm not perfect
And I bet neither are you if you listening
So you need to just accept what's there, know what I mean?
But look, you need to just let this play out
From track one, to track whatever, however-many-I-put-on-here
You need to just listen to this cause look man, this is the first time
Canadian, down south, my man, Smallz, your boy, Drake
You know what it is man, so just tune in nigga

This goes out to the beautiful girls
Which one of y'all, which, which one
Which, which one of y'all
Which one of y'all goin' home with Trigga?

I see you at the club, ooh, shawty
Walkin' past a nigga lookin' at me all naughty
Then I said, "Baby, wassup?"
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug

Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil' buzz
Up in VIP with all my thug niggas
You leaned over and said you want me

Girl, when the valet pull the Benz up
Off to the crib, shawty, where we gonna end up
Girl, sit back, relax, hold up
Let me turn the radio on

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think


Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex

Put the code in the gate, pull up to the driveway
Said she like the way I touch her, listenin' to usher
(Yup)
I got a confession
(What?)
Know we 'bout to sin, but your body is a blessing
(Father, forgive me)

Girl, can we take it up stairs
(Up, up, up stairs)
My bed's waitin' there
(Waitin' there, yeah)

All I want to do is
(All I wanna do)
Is give you all of me
Won't you give me all of you?


I want your body like right now
(Right now)
You know I live a magnum lifestyle
(Lifestyle)
Baby, turn the lights down
And I'mma turn you on

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

Girl, when I pull back them sheets
(Take the covers off)
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
'Cause I do it like I did
You gonna think I invented sex

It's a celebration clap, clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of Moscato
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this


Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out

Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it

Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex

[Hook]
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still…

[Verse 1]
Clean in this bitch I'm feelin' myself goddamn a nigga rich
And every time I touch it guaranteed to be hit
And when them checks come guaranteed to be a split
I'm flyer then an invitation
Like I'm the information
Toronto's been waiting and I'm glad ya'll been waiting patient
But I'm here now these niggas is old news
I mix cocaine powder with the pro tools
(Whip it) Yeah crack that's just how I double back
Europeako jeans bleeding on them white air max
And these niggas keep asking me when you gon' drop
Why the fuck you keep harassing me when's that gon' stop
I guess its when my albums selling in the stores
And they sayin' damn I use to know the boy
Now I barely see em
And the little kids wanna be him
He a star now look up you'll probably see him
Hook
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em
Nigga I'm Still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still…


[Verse 2: Page]
Fly as I wanna be kush in the air I get high as I wanna be
S550 navigatin' where I gonna be
P.A.G. mother fucker don't forget the E
Rep T dot till they bury me
Automare the wrist red diamonds in the necklace
Been getting' checks while you rappers stay checkless
Real street nigga feel free to do a checklist
They don't really make em like me
Had to give you a second to breathe
Nigga ballin' still a hobby and I do that with ease
I'm bout to catch pneumonia because my neck stay freeze
I'm in the west indies
A 100 grand on a cheap white tee
I'm the man in my city they demand at me
Nigga I rep for my city like a football team
I'm fly like the New York Jets be
In a G5 two nines on me like Wayne Gretzky

[Verse 1: Drake]
Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is "Where the rest of my commas?"
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah


[Verse 2: Drake]
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, "How Does It Feel?"
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?


[Outro: Nai Palm]
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (Feel me)
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing (My heartbeat's racing)
Tempt me, drive me (Tempt me)
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly (Highly)
It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for you

[Chorus: Drake]
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town

[Verse 1]
Set up the occasion
I’m up in the place and
If amazing was a young bitch
I'd be going to jail cause I'm fucking amazing
What's up for the taking
I’m ready and I'm willing, why the fuck are we waiting
Yeah, and baby you should bring your best friend
Then you should persuade her to let me get some sex in
Don't get offended, baby, that's just a suggestion
Really we can do it however..you..like
I’m probably in your hotel tonight
Whatever floor that me and 40 staying on is smelling riiight
Yeah, just know we grinding till it’s light out
Show up in your city, turn that motherfucker right out
Yeah, tell me who controls kings
I don’t follow rules, stupid old things
I’m riding through the city in the coupe with those wings
My team deserves some motherfucking Super Bowl rings
Oh yeah, and I know we gon' get it
Me and Jeezy bout whatever, shorty, holla if you with it
Even though I want it to this shit don’t last forever
But better late than never, honestly I’d like to say it's been a pleasure


[Chorus: Drake]
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town

[Chorus: Drake]
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure

Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money goooo
For the H-Towwwwwn

[Verse 1:Bun B]
Ladies and gentlemen you're now listenin to the Dirty South trillionaire ('naire)
Keepin it trill in there, been here and he's still in there (there)
Pay attention, it's the beginnin of a new era (era)
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer (view clearer)
It's like Lasik but are basic
Ebonics if you're hooked on chronic and you can taste it
Trace it, recognize the real when ya face it
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted
One shot of Patron, then another one to chase it
Put me to the test, I won't pass it I'll ace it
Been so many places, up and down the interstate
Cities that I've never been, wonderin if they fin' to hate
Step up in the spot, let 'em look me in the grill (grill)
So they can see it for theyself that
I keep it trill (I keep it trill) I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip
So it's all good (good) don't even trip
Believe me it's been a pleasure


[Chorus: Drake]
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do

Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Man I've been all over the world
Tryin to tell 'em 'bout the trill and what we been through (through)
What we already done and what we fin' do (do)
What we got into, what we gettin into (to)
When ties 'bout to cut it closer than a ginsu ('su)
Roll through Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama ('bama)
Jacksonville to Jackson, Mississippi spittin grammar (spittin grammar)
From Shreveport (*echo* 'port) down to New Orleans ('leans)
And all points in between just to get the cream (cream)
Me and my "II Trill" team on the road flippin' (flippin')
Eight hours straight, no stops, no trippin' (trippin')
Had to keep them heaters on 'em so it's no slippin' (slippin')
Promote a play with show money, we were slow grippin' (slow grippin')
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down (down)
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town (town)
But we always made it home okay
And we still on the road to this day
I gotta say it's been a pleasure


[Chorus: Drake]
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do

[Verse 3: Bun B]
They say that you never really know
What you got 'til it's gone and can't touch it (touch it)
If it look too good to be true, you can't trust it (trust it)
If you never had it (*echo* had it) then you can never miss it (miss it)
But looks can be deceivin, so don't you get it twisted (twisted)
Walked a lot of miles in these old school J's (J's)
Thought of many ways, lookin at back in the days (days)
Like how to climb from in between a rock, and a hard place
How to keep your cool when you're dealin' with a hard case (with a hard case)
And how to duck, when the judge throw the book at you (the book at you)
And it's a two-sided mirror that you're lookin through (you're lookin through)
The phone receiver's in your hand starin' at your child (child)
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile (smile)
See that's how real life is and how it can be (can be)
And how it's deeper then just comin down candy (candy)
So I'm just tryin to play the cards that they hand me
For those that overstood me, understand me
It's been a pleasure


[Chorus: Drake]
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do

Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town

[Outro: Drake]
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
I'll just say it's been a pleasure



[Intro: John Miles]
You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
'Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushin' the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargainin' on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing

[Verse 2: Drake]
Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit
And got too fuckin' comfy
'Cause we still fuckin' hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin' faded, aw yeah I'm fuckin' faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aw yeah, I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin' all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, stop playin', I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, Sheneneh, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock .40′s, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, I'ma need some fuckin' goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil' Weezyana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin' with a full deck but I deal ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfuckin' field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how-much-you-love-your-lady" money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date nigga
I'm a grown-ass Blood, stop playin' with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat, ha, Hello Kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, Tempurpedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think it's cleavage
Its Young Money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meetin'
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop-pop-potato salad


"I Been That Girl"

Heard about the Tires on his brand new car
I knew that he'd drive You crazy
Guess the only option's To fall when you get
Pushed too far
You'll think about that Next time
Maybe
Oh, when he's calling Your name out
When he needs you back In his life
Cause he's got some secrets And all of them came out
When it's all in your name
But you can't make the payment
He needs you to stay But you wanna go
I know

[Chorus:]
I know cause
I've been that girl
I've been that
I've been that
I've been that girl
I've been that
I've been that
I've been that girl
I've been that
I've been that
I've been that girl
Whoa hoo oh


[B-Section:]
But never again
Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again
No, never again

Heard you got into it With his ex Sunday night
Who really fights on a Sunday?
Must be sick Of telling your friends
That life's alright
You'll wanna change That shit one day
Oh
When you been in the kitchen
And you fix him a dinner
You wanna go talk to him
But he doesn't listen
When he's played Enough games
And you played your position
He'll tell you to stay
But you'll wanna go
I know

[Repeat Chorus 1x]


[Repeat B-Section 1x]

[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shit, nigga, this what I does
I swear I ain't lyin' like this is my cubs
This is my tub and I'm dirtier than the summer, bitch
Weezy F. Baby, always lookin' like I done some shit
You ain't on nothin' bitch, better know who you fuckin' with
Try to fuck me, I'll kill you and who you comin' with
No homo, T, I had to go stupid
I'm on them high heels and I am no Bootsy
Collins Avenue, ridin' with the Phantom roof gone
Or the Maybach two-tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24's boy, what are you on?
I'm richer than a bitch without the grey poupon
Yeah, I'm talkin' out of my head
I make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a blood muthafucka, a blood muthafucka
Forever like E-T-C, period muthafucka


[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm so unsigned, it would blow ones mind
Cause to every single record, I am so unkind
There are no holds barred, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know drugs cost
So P-A-Y-U-P
I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me
Never L-I-E, I got everything I tell 'em I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Ya heard me?
Who else tryna smoke? Yeah, nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the preasure is what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a ski-doo
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down ho, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that: 10-4


[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
Put on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit
Make a plumber throw his plunger like, "I can't deal with this shit"
They say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch I'm back on my shit like a fly
Since you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly
Like Pookie, take a dookie on the rapper loose leaf
And throw his trash ass through the window like Mookie
To a shark you just sushi
You ain't hard, you're coochie, Wally Oochie
Soft as newborn booty
Said I'm movin' slow, I'm just thinkin' fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, I'm 'bout to lap your ass
And nigga I don't rest, I'm up 'til my time's up
I been a tec chef, all my beef prime cut
This ain't punch lines, nigga your punch is lyin'
Cause the only punch you ever gave was Hawaiian


[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Leaving me (leavin' me)
Dippin' out on me (on me)
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly (Quickly) learned yourself through me (Through me)
Already gave you what you needed, I guess (Ooh yeah)
I guess (Yeah) yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody (Ooh yeah)
Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody (Ooh yeah)
Did it over text, didn't call me (Ooh yeah)
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody
Even if you gotta leave somebody (Body) yeah

[Chorus: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)
Most of these things I don't wanna say (Jaded)
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous, oh)
You got somethin' real, not basic (Ooh yeah)
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)
Most of these things, I don't wanna say (Say)
I wanna be around while you chasin'
(Wanna be around, wanna be around)
You wanna hit me up when you make it (Ooh, yeah)
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around)
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous)
You got somethin' real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')
Yeah, dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)


[Verse 2: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (Young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)


[Chorus: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Most of these things I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around, dangerous, oh, ooh yeah)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')



[Verse 1: Drake]
26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
Of all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning
On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

[Interlude: Dennis Graham]
But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is
That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through errythang...
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD…

[Verse 2: Drake]
Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms)
Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be?
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ********
Hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
'Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less than me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back


Yo

[Refrain: Jorja Smith]
When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I'm sure
They'll know you're trying to help 'em

[Verse: Drake]
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on the road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah


[Refrain: Jorja Smith]
When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know, they'll know

[Outro: Drake]
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?



[Produced by Boi-1da]

[Intro]
Boi-1da... Drizzy

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket on my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, uhh, you staying broke
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no one my size
Whatever 40's smokin' 'bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, I'm taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause it's about to go

[Verse 2]
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest, I'mma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-pass is as valid as can be
I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she's smiling back at me like


[Verse 1: Drake]
This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let 'em all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple "I think that we’re ready"s
Couple "I think that we should we wait"s
Are we actin' like a couple ?I’m just tryna get it straight
Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes
And then

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin'
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall


[Verse 2: Drake]
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I’m confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry? They need to get their sentencin'
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin'
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall


[Jhene Aiko]
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end
But then the season changed

[Drake]
You were my, you were my, you were my girl
Shoulda made, shoulda made you my world
Shoulda done everything to make you happy, baby
Oh yeah

[Jhene Aiko]
Can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
And I’m too fly for this shit
Oh-a wooh
I am Japanese if you please

[Verse 1: Bei Maejor]
It started off with a round of applause
Cheers to my women who [?]
Who never been a heartbreaker, got a mind about it
Thought I had that, but I was wrong... lemme tell ya bout it
She was like my angel from way up above
She cried from the sky, she would shower me with love
Had her over every day, every single day I did
Started gettin careless, so next thing you know we made a kid
She was like mmm, I was like yess!
I hope we have a son, watch this nigga be the best
And right around june she took a plane & it was too late...
I did the math & found out her due date was...

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
In julyy. there were fireworks exploding
But now it's getting colder. the leaves are turning colors
Ask me why. it's just not our season
The one & only reason, ahhh

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, this starts as my snipers hit they marks
And ya guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like clap, clap... let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let em all go
And most women are motivated, so I act accordingly
But this is so eshing that it means a lil more to me
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be
I provide protection if you open the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple "I think that were readys", couple "I think we should waits"
Are we actin like a couple? I'm just trynna get it straight
Cause I'm over here convinced that it's too early for mistakes & man...


[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Ohh, we had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days, I can't stand the rain
In julyy. there were fireworks exploding
But now it's getting colder. the leaves are turning colors
Ask me why. it's just not our season
The one & only reason, baby oh baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

[Verse 3: Drake & Bei Maejor]
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go?
I followed the rules & told ya everything ya had to know
Had ya over every night, every night was passionate
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident
Cause she was supposed to be my shawty, my baby
[?] this crazy
I put your life in front of mine because that's where you asked to be
Sayin I don't treat you the same, so now you askin me
Who cares chivarly, they need to get they sentencing
Meanwhile we arguin, & I can't get a sentence in
And just as I was hangin up the phone, she told me to hold on
Cause she's finally comin home in july...

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
In julyy. (yes) there were fireworks exploding
But now it's getting colder
(It's getting colder) the leaves are turning colors
Ask me why. it's just not our season
The one & only reason. baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall


See
Wassup
It's funny cause
Yeah?
I never thought this would end
Listen baby, it's not gonna end
But then the season changed
Can we, can we bring it back though?
(You were my, you were my, you were my love
You done made, you done made, you done made my world)
Cause you are my girl, & I wanted you to be my world
So I'm a do everything to make sure you happy
{Watcha say}
Keep faithful, keep faithful, keep faithful, keep faithful
Scream jullyy, then theyll turn into a butterfly

[Intro]
You know when I get quiet I'm always up to something, man
You  know that, ha
That  boy up to somethin'
Ayy, look

[Verse]
I'm laid over the bad bitch waiting on a package
Just  had a flashback, I used to have a pissy mattress
And  I done choosed to trap, it's what I had to do
The police riding up and down the avenue
As  soon as they touch me, running it up on the boulevard
When you only keep it 100, I guess they can't pull your card
Fuck the lean, I'm on the Henny
Fuck your main, I'm gettin' plenty
I  prolly pull up in my Honda, I drive wherever I wanna
And I was just starving on Friday but now I'm back balling on Tuesday
He probably hate on my bitches, runnin' round calling 'em groupies
I ride around with extensions, I keep it on me, I'm Gucci
I get a whole lot of Benji's, I put 'em on me like Boosie
I fuck up the juggin' for rappin', then I got right back to trappin'
I sold all the pounds for the profit, then hit the mall and went shoppin'
I'm who you call if you need me, need me, gon' get it, we got it
And I leave the gas up to Diesel, don't talk to me, switch the topic

[Outro]
I mean, yeah, it ain't nothing positive, it ain't about getting no money
I mean, where I'm at right now, you know what I'm sayin', I don't wanna have nothing to do with that shit, you feel me?
I wish everybody peace and blessings



[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 1: Drake]
These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 2: Drake]
She said you're my everything
I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything

[Bridge: Drake]
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk, are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do


[Hook: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
(Put a bib on me)
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me

The things I can't change are the reasons you love me

Listen, you can hear them calling my name

Feel like we one in the same, our relationship changed
(Just like a baby, drooling over you)
That or it never existed, yeah
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Forget what they talkin' about on your timeline, yeah
'Cause that's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

This shit is everything to me, this here is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?

How was your night pop?

[Drake]
It was, uh... it was alright. Shit's just crazy man. The whole energy out here is just changing, you know, it's just getting dark man, quick. It's like mans are on the road it feels like as if anybody is a target, you know, you just don't know where it's gonna come from, can't even gauge it man. It's like I go from that, trying to balance that to just balance my own sanity, drinking more, smoking more, you know staying up so late that it's early, like fuck. I'm not losing it though, you know, I'm just venting, I'm not like worried, it's already too late for these guys trust me, I'm just more worried about myself you know, I just gotta come home.

By @ed1jetson

(Verse 1)

Lazy rappers like to talk so much shit
Its so ignorant, just pick up your feet
If you wanna make it make some viral hits
In an endless sea of opinion...
No one really gives a shit
Tired of all the mindless braggin
Man thats going out of fashion
I came up in the underground
Under the ground of manhattan
No money, man i do this with an evil passion
No honey, Fuck that ass and cash and...
Skate skate skate skate, keep up the grindin
On that double time, get recording time in
In that batcave, fuck your friends, get it in
Fuck that bitch again again
Man... your so fuckin ignorant

(verse 2)

Standin in my mind, tryin to figure out my path
Read so into it i swear picked apart my past
Dont care where i end up
I just know im never going back
Fuck that shit fuck that shit
Im never going back
See that life there, its a trap
Just like your marrige its an act
You know that thats a fact
Rattatat rattatat, wakaflocka where you at
Going ham grade A swag
B4 i leave just like my dad
Lines broken from the crack
Crack smoke to the sky
Raise the volume, eletrified
Raised my mind lo to high
Ive lived my life, id love to die
And i try itry i try
Still im always getting by
Bad desision, confrontations
Livining reckless, reckless cry

[Verse 1: Onitsha]
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I should've gotten there by now
I always thought I'd be the one to make it
It's probably better anyhow

[Refrain]
If this is how my story goes (turning pages)
What's its doing, nobody knows, but God

[Chorus]
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

[Verse 2: Drake]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal, and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been

[Refrain]
If this is how my story goes (turning pages)
What tomorrow has us doing, nobody knows, but God

[Verse 3]
Isn't it ironic?
Ain't it funny how sometimes we got our own plan
And life can just switch it up?
When life be dealing them losing hands
And leave you feeling like giving up
Sometimes it's hard to find a smile
Keep ya head up
Feel like it ain't gonna happen, no never
When defeat is not the magic door (it's hard to not open)
And the pain that you feel is hardcore
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
It's those memories of my sweetest, I was 15 when I started
Time flies, sometimes I feels like
It's happening for everybody but me
But I won't forget the promise I remember what he told me:
I hope that you can tell

I was only tryna get ahead
(I was only tryna get ahead)

[Chorus]
If the spotlight makes you nervous
Don't you worry, don't you fear
Worries can't fill up your cares, ohhh
And you're looking for a purpose
Many plans in the minds of man, only God's purpose will stand, ohhh

I was only tryna get ahead
I was only tryna get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
It makes you nervous, woahhh, yeah




[Produced by Francis and the Lights]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

[Verse 2: Drake]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

[Verse 3: Drake]
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

[Outro]
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous




[Verse 1]
I still remember where we were
Slow it down
First time we had the nerve
First time was not rehearsed
First time was almost perfect, still
There's no such thing as too far
No, no such thing as too far
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Too far gone
Still know that we can work
Slow it down
Still know what you deserve
Still mad 'bout who we are
But no different than we were
But still
There's no such thing as too far
No, no such thing as too far
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Too far gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Should be here, but you ain't right now
Slow it down
Could be there, but I ain't right now
Both those things could be changed right now, and
I shouldn't be thinkin' about
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
What I would do if I was beside you
Slow it down
In a king-sized suite, layin' in those sheets
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
You know we work it out and I keep my eyes on you
Slow it down
You know I figured out the secrets to your body, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe

[Chorus]
Keep calm, keep calm
Slow it down
'Cause it's now or never
I want this forever
No one does it better, babe
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Keep calm, keep calm
Slow it down
Let's get it together
I want this forever
No one does it better, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe

[Verse 2]
I know you got your ways
Slow it down
I hope some change
I love the way you are
I'll take you either way
And if you don't come
Are you gon' stay?
And I don't wanna let you be the one that got away
Let's do anything but that
Slow it down
Oh no, oh no
I'm willing to do anything but that
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I should be there, but I can't right now
Slow it down
Could be here, but you ain't right now
Both those things could be changed right now, and
I shouldn't be thinkin' about
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
What I would do if I was beside you
Slow it down
In a king-sized suite, layin' in those sheets
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
You know we work it out and I keep my eyes on you
Slow it down
You know I figured out the secrets to your body, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe

[Chorus]
Keep calm, keep calm (oh yeah, yeah)
Slow it down
'Cause it's now or never
I want this forever
No one does it better, babe
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
And all I can say is
Keep calm
Slow it down
And all I can say is
Keep calm
Together
Let's get it together
I want this forever
No one does it better, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe

[Outro]
Slow it down
Yeah, yeah
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Take time, take time
Takin' our time, and I get in and slide
Slow it down
Ooh, baby
And I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Slow it down
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Slow it down




[Verse 1: dvsn]
How far we go
Always seems to get better with time
Won't you, outsmart me
Told me that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know you
I'll get to know you again
You want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
Now we're in the zone
Gon' let me all in again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again
Over and over again
You tell me I should know you
But I'll get to know you again
And you want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
When we're in the zone you
Gon' let me own it again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Now you're coming over
You're coming over

[Verse 2: dvsn]
I wet all the floors of your ego, damn
Feel I was slipping away
And you know that I ain't gonna go
Ain't gonna go nowhere, nowhere
I guess some of these things never change, no, no
There's a lot going on and you know that it's true
There's a lot on my mind and you bother the times when I'm not here with you
But keep it way more than 100, keep it 110
Show me what I gotta do

[Chorus: Drake & dvsn]
And I know that you been working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Bridge: dvsn]
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
And until you do baby (don't you leave)
It ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Tonight I'll make sure you (cum befor me)
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
But before you do (don't you leave)
It ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Make sure that you (cum before me)


[Verse 3: dvsn]
Have to get you on top of me
And we 'gon do this thing properly
Make you throw your hands in the air, throw your hair back
Like a winning ticket off the lottery
But you don't wanna, no, you don't want to start with me
No, you don't want to start with me
But you shouldn't keep shaking that in front of me
Unless you're down to do this publicly
Girl you know you, know you gotta get comfortable
All the dogs here, run with me
And I fuck with you
So if you really fuck with me
Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you
And she hit me with that "I don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions"
Well, let's see what's next then

[Outro: dvsn]
I'm gonna make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)
Gonna make sure, make sure (don't you leave)
You know that I'm gon' make sure (need you to know)
Gonna make sure, make sure (cum before me)
Gonna make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)
Gonna make sure, make sure (don't you leave)
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure (need you to know)
Gonna make sure, make sure (cum before me)


[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Chorus]
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine


[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that


[Chorus]
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro: Girl (Spoken)]
Any time people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Seh feh



I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama’s house we'd argue every month
N@#$a, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like “Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
N@#$a, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show
And we started from the bottom now we here
—Drake, Started From the Bottom

When I was 20 years old, I was a computer science major at Columbia University and I needed a summer job. It was 1986 and I was barely aware of a place called Silicon Valley. In those days there was no “startup culture or entrepreneurship movement”. Most people were only recently becoming aware that computers existed and almost nobody knew where they came from. The startups themselves were quite different than today’s breed. Most of the important startups were computer companies like Sun Microsystems, Apollo Computer, Cyrdome, Compaq and Silicon Graphics. In 1986, there was no outsourced manufacturing and China was largely irrelevant to the technology industry. All the companies in those days had their own manufacturing—often in Silicon Valley—and were very large in terms of employees compared to today. Having more than 100 employees prior to shipping a product was not unusual.

Although there were important exceptions, very few 20-year-olds started companies in those days. I was not the exception—I just wanted a job. I wanted a job, but I knew absolutely nobody in technology or in Silicon Valley and there were no technology startups in New York. I had no idea how to get a job and then I got a break.

My father’s friend had just married Ed McCracken, the CEO of Silicon Graphics. I had my father ask her if she would talk to Ed, which she did. Ed then passed me to his head of Administration, Ken Coleman. Eureka! I had made the proverbial “friend of a friend of friend” connection.

Ken agreed to meet with the son-of-a-friend-of-the-CEO’s-wife. After we met, he also agreed to take a chance on me as a summer intern.

Silicon Graphics was the Google of its day—the place where all the best engineers wanted to work. The company invented modern computer graphics and was building the coolest machines in the world. Prior to arriving, the only jobs that I’d held were paperboy, busboy, waiter, bellhop and valet attendant. Coming from those environments, I thought that I had died and gone to heaven. One day I’m washing dishes and the next day I’m helping debug the operating system that would run the graphics for Jurassic Park. In one connection, I’d gone from the outhouse to the penthouse. Everybody at Silicon Graphics seemed to be a genius, the products were incredible and I never wanted to leave work. I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get myself to Silicon Valley permanently.

Unfortunately, I had not been properly socialized for life inside a big corporation. As the son of a new left radical (who later completely switched sides), I was combat trained. If somebody said something that I didn’t agree with, I wouldn’t hesitate to attack them ruthlessly, call their ideas stupid or personally insult them. I couldn’t help it. It was how I was raised. It was like I was Huey P. Newton and everybody else was The Man. I am quite sure that I would have and should have been fired several times, but for some reason Ken Coleman took an interest in me and smoothed things over whenever I got myself into trouble. He was my personal guardian angel. He helped me to build my life and career doing what I loved.

Over the years, despite being about 100 times more important than me, Ken always found time to meet with me and give me pointers about how to be effective. Much of what you read on this blog originally came from Ken.

After we met, Ken’s career continued to accelerate. He eventually became the chief operating officer of Silicon Graphics. He is now chairman of Saama Technologies and on the board of City National Bank, United Online and Accelrys. And Ken continues to help people like me. He helps people figure out how to fit into the amazing, innovative, magical world known as Silicon Valley.

This fits in very well with how we think about Andreessen Horowitz. We help technical founders learn how to be CEOs, we help engineers find the right company and we help executives find the right match. So, it’s natural, obvious and awesome that today we announce that Ken Coleman is joining Andreessen Horowitz as a Special Advisor.


[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, What up y'all? Yeah
Soundtrakk, what's popping baby?
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here, I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out, uh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week, he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, uh
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark


[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast
Uh, uh, uh

[Break: Drake]
What up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check

[Verse 2: Drake]
My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barely remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would've done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
Luckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse
So every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
And plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
So now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
Playing chess, looking through some old school record ads
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
And now I coast clear, take a deep breath
Feeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
This is each test life's ever given me
A-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a
Kick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
The kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
Think it's obvious that they need my soul
My cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"
She said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"


[Hook: Drake]
So I kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push Coast
Fast as the wheels replaced
I gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
So I kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Coast
Peep the way I roll
Just a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
So I kick Then push
And coast

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, yeah
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said "There's no skating here"


[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, uh, uh
And push, yeah, yeah
And coast
Ah ha, Swanky

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look I let the beat bang I don't claim colors
Honestly the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter but when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi coast
Couple days on the beach then it's adios (Killa)
Just look at what I done alone
You will swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you could prolly feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I'll never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs... drizzy

[Chorus: Drake]
Uh, I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh, and I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around shit will neva be the same
I'm a killa, killa, killa, killa


[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Listen, look, before rap my last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success it look like right now
What was once gray skies is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones that ya'll said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps and you'll see what I'm 'bout
I keep my money coming in and never going out
Chuck taylors on the pavement with the blamma's out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops buck you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over shined
Been fucked bitches I been on my grind
Cause on a mission your worst enemy is idle time... hussle

[Chorus: Drake]
Uh, I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh, and I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around shit will neva be the same
I'm a killa, killa, killa, killa nigga

King

Im the king with all the confidence
Top of all this monster shit
Whos the best at spitting its mother fucking obvious
Im reppin till the death of me
Cold world antifreeze
Superhero specialty
Real ill medically
Know my team
Know my glory
Getting tatted up till im so damn gory
Got these bad bitches so money hungry horny
Got a dragon otherworld exploring
Bitch ur boring
Cut the story


I keep the money pouring
Damn im soaring
Fresh till the death of me
Never get the best of me
Got a chick next to me
I heal her sexually
Never give me anything
Never no settling
I take what i want And put it in my treasury
Swag on infinity never gon measure me
I give her that sensual sextasy epically
Money is the outcome
Money is the income
Making mo money is where i mofucking came from
Niggas in the struggle
Niggas on they hustle
So much trouble
I bust bust bust you
Nothings ever stopping me
Im an anomaly
Top of the mountain peak
Devil breathes under me
Beat fate luckily
The breeze freeze under me
Nothing can touch the beast
Not before i touch the piece
Ill eradicate u u bitch disease
Best thing happening
I kill you happily
Changed so drastically
Take em down tactfully
Flying on my carpet so damn magically
Bitches only dramatize
Ima catch a homicide
Or ima catch a felony
Knowing what ur telling me
Still dont listen
My hearts soul distant
Soulless devilish ur morales are irrelevant
This my first testament
Gods my family
God looks out in every single tragedy



[Intro]
Lets go
Well alright, well alright
Look
Uh

[Verse]
Feeling sorry for the runner up
I’m still awake, getting money while the sun is up
And they keep saying how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie star doesn’t put the numbers up
Man, hate is so passé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and it’s just me and my money
Ya don’t even get to play when ya’ll leading by 20
Yeah I infiltrated the game
I was hesitant at first and fear what it would change
Now I’m high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still managed to keep all of my opinions the same
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit
Shout out to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah from the beginning to the end
Know I’m into making history not into making friends
Muthafuckaaaa…




[Intro: Giggs & Drake]
(Ness on the beat)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 1: Drake & Giggs]
Demon just got out the can (Yeah)
I gave my bro an advance (Yeah)
Love is just not in my plans
Not even takin' a chance
Studio right in my yaad
I'm doin' ten in a week
How long I been on this streak?
Dream about work in my sleep (Oof)
Okay, I got a lock on the streets
Shoutout to T, he did three
And he brought it in 'cause of me
You don't know nothin' 'bout me
Life for my bruddas is deep
Long as they all on they feet
Long as they pockets is greaze (Greaze!)
I'm in the penthouse but still, nothin' is sweet (Yeah)
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep (Mmm!)

[Interlude: Giggs]
You know dem ones? Hahaha

[Verse 2: Giggs]

And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spen jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy (Oof!)
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky (Jerky)

October Firm


[Intro: Jay Z]
We gotta sell these bitches the dream, my nigga
Niggas like Walt Disney around this bitch

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
You're in the presence of the real
Can't fathom where I'm at, baby, pop another pill
In a whole 'nother realm
If you want to make a movie let me know
It's a whole another film
I suggest you get your dress for the Golden Globes
What you know about Tim
Top down, the Aventador, 4 AM
On the sunset strip
Trying to get high at the sunset, baby don't trip
Hollywood lights, Miami nights
I'm on a motherfucking binge
Just might go and buy a Benz
Or trade a car for your friends
Oh yeah, we playing with them M's

[Hook: Timbaland]
Ridin' down Collins with my entourage following
Just left SoHo headed to the Go-Go
Lap dance for the girls
Let me put her hands on her curves
You ain't about that life, you scurred
Ah, baby, you scurred—like skrrt to the crib
What you know about the kid?
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing


[Verse 2: Drake]
I just got back home, 40 days on vacation
No one killing the game, shit is all for the taking
What the fuck did I stutter? Am I being mistaken?
I'm a s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-star in the makin'
Who you said was the man? What the fuck is a deal?
Really do it the best, I'm DJ Khaled for real
Got my thumb on the pulse, got impeccable timin'
If they forgot about my worth, I got a check to remind 'em
Got some things on the wrist, Cartier with the diamonds
If this was 10 years ago nigga would've went diamond
I been singing and rapping, I make a killin' in both
If I had to choose a Jackson man, I'm feelin' like Bo
Fresh down to the socks, team look like the Raiders
I don't take this shit for granted, I'd like to thank my creator
I'm coming b-b-b-b-b-b-b-back on you haters
I'm 'bout to put this bitch on her back and get back to you later
Man, what's up?

[Hook: Timbaland]
Ridin' down Collins with my entourage following
Just left SoHo headed to the Go-Go
Lap dance for the girls
Let her put her hands on the curves
You ain't about that life, you scurred
Ah, baby, you scurred—like skrrt to the crib
What you know about the kid
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing


[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Imagine straight from work to the plane
Ain't no baggage claim
Don't need to change your clothes, girl, or your last name
Motherfuckers want to act like I'mma call
If you want to be a star, girl you need a co-star
Got some bitches we can call up, babe
Now they want to know who you are and how you got there
Girl, I can try to care, oh, get you out of here
You and all this gold on me
On a plane going home, not as you want
What you motherfuckers know about me?



[Part 1]

Hol' it yute, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it

15 Fort York shit, y'know?
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
(Yeah!)

[Part 2]

[Beat Switch]

[Chorus]
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

[Verse 2]
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and woah
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

[Chorus]
I was running through the 6 with my woes
And you know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go

[Outro: Popcaan & Drake]

Yeah, pop, whippin', wrist is goin' thirty with it, ooh, yeah
Put the beat in front of me, I'm dirtyin' it, yeah, what?
Do this shit for real, you niggas dabble in it, yeah
Say you need a minute, I don't have a minute, yeah
And if I gotta land, I'ma—
Stick that motherfucker at the Clearport and park that

[Chorus]
Making moves off the laptop
Spending pay at the gas stop
Car sitting on the back top
Only uber these days, that's a rest spot, ooh
Bands hit the right hand
Spending pay at the gas stop, woah
Weed got me right though, ooh
Just another day in the cycle

[Verse]
Hey, cha-cha ay

She said "ooh I like the moves, I need to stay"
Honestly I don't want to leave

[Outro]
Oh yeah
I'm in a cycle, yeah
Oh yea yea yea
Woah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go
Take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I would stand on line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven

[Chorus: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
That I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, ffly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make


[Verse 2: Drake]
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go L-A, V-A
N-Y, T-O
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin' at amazing'
Girls tryin' sell a whole lobby of us
Hear 'em all screaming then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down

[Chorus: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
That I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, ffly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make


[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Guess who's on third?
Lupe still like Lupin the Third
Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat
Engarde, Touch Lupe cool as the Unthawed
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge
I come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car

[Chorus: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
That I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, ffly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make

[Intro: Drake]
Woah, woah
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?


[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 3: Drake]
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it


[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?



[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
He took a half and I took the whole thing, you need to slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these people be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react

Please do not play those songs at the party, I can't evеn listen to that (No)
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must bе a victory lap, ayy

I'm not your baby, I'm not just a singer, you play with me, you gon' get slapped (Get slapped, ooh-oh)

[Intro]
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'

[Chorus]
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend

[Verse 1]
I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They don't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

[Pre-Chorus]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'

[Chorus]
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend

[Verse 2]
I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeah, you know wassup, yeah
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

[Pre-Chorus]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'

[Chorus]
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend

[Outro]
I'm the one


Дима что ты сделал?

Я ебал твой рот
Нассу тебе в компот!
Я курю траву
Мамок всех ебу:)

Захочу её, значит получу
Мне грозят, пару сроков дать (
Я бл#ть не боюсь, с этой пососусь

-

Заварю себе кокос
Это просто передоз
Я еб#л твою шалаву
Ей так нравится кокос

Твоя мама оценила
За моей спиною бош
Я.............. всех твоих подруг

Они без меня, как без своих рук
Я люблю этот кокос
Топ 1 я в списке Forps
Обгоняю я Коржа, и взлетаю в небеса


Да да да, я взлетаю в небеса
Поднимаюсь как звезда, этим сукам всем пизда(х3)

Да да да, я взлетаю в небеса(х2)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I get it how I live it
I live it how I get it, y'all don't really get it
I pull up in a lemon, blocks get to spinnin'
Money 3D printin'
Never had a limit, never been religious
I just always had opinions
My daddy told me, "Listen
You better get some money and not die and go to prison"
So you see
Yeah, I got rich and stayed free
Free the dawgs doin' B.I.Ds
I know everybody not like me
Ayy, got the nerve to want a Bentley for her birthday
I said, "Maybe I could rent it for your birthday
Matter of fact I need a favor for the remix
Maybe I can get some 50s for your birthday"
Ayy, get to sneakin' for you, bae
Say we talk but we ain't speakin' every day
And I know you know what P about to say

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I get it how I live it
I live it how I get it
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five


[Verse 2: Rihanna]
You can catch me, Rih, in the new La Ferrar'
And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts
But everyday, hey, wasn't lemonade
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate
Would I be okay?
So I prayed and I played
It's Rihanna, nigga
My constellation in space
Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase, nigga

[Intro: Sikness]
Put my county on my back let em know I'm real
Put my county on my back let em know I'm real

[Verse 1: B-Eazy (Kid Dream-Away)]
Well they know me as B-Eazy, right now I'm on my psychedelic shit
Dark shades, big dreams that no one could even think of
Living in that BLACK FORREST where niggas couldn't survive in
I'm zonin' I'm vibin' these lame niggas they jivin'
These girls tell me they love me but I know that they lying
So I pay them no attention, gotta move on to the next thing
Put on for my county, and put on for VA
Can't forget where I come from or all of my love ones
When I'm chasin' these dreams tryna get this doe
Keeping it real is all I know
When it comes to this music I never stop, I just go go go
Think about it all day, I'm a make it, you'll see

[Hook]
Put my county on my back let em know I'm real
Its somethin' I ain't gotta say they can feel
Never fade away from the real me, always keep it one hundred and always be me
They may change yeah, they may change, but I'm a always be the same, always be the same
They may change yeah, they may change, but I'm a always be the same, always be the same

[Verse 2: Sikness]
Layin' on a purple cloud pillow, just chillin'
Can't describe the feelin, bout to take off leave a hole in the celilin'
Fiends for my music cause my shit dope, only lookin' up like my neck broke
Or like a cloud of smoke, gasoline and flame at the end of the rope
Fuckin' clown but its not a joke
Pump water gun in shawty pussy let it super soak
Yeah I'm feelin' myself no materbation
My head blown up I need deflation
Frustion steady pasen and waitin'
To put a end to the bullshittin' and perpertatin'
Me and Eazy in a leauge of our own, use to think my mind was gone
But its clear to see that we on

[Hook]


[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, when did you get like this?
Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, "This just ain't my style"
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile for me, no

[Chorus: Peter Bjorn & John]
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us

[Verse 2: Drake]
When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before?
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store

[Chorus: Peter Bjorn & John]
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us


[Verse 3: Drake]
Look, leave me, leave me, I can't fucking stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we 'posed to be together 'til the world end
But I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call, you just tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that? Do that, do that, yeah

[Chorus: Peter Bjorn & John]
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us

[Intro: Pimp C]
Man, get the fuck away from us, we don't want nothin' but money
We some family men, we gettin' this paper
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
And I had to put that out there, Bun
Because a lot of niggas doin' lot of Fugazi shit out here, man

[Chorus]
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell

[Verse]
All you do is lie to me
And dub me, you never love me
Any confidence I came with, you take it from me
I just wanna get beside you and make you love me
I just can not take the silence, you keep ignorin' me
See you makin' all this time for more important things
We was s'posed to catch a vibe the other night
Busy now, but you was down that other time
Why you always lead me on and give me signs?
I just wanna get beside and make you mine
I just wanna come inside and reunite
Got me waitin' outside (Hah)


[Chorus]
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell

[Outro: Diddy]
Uhm, you was just so in your pocket, uhm
Cats used to tell me when they used to come to my house in Miami and shit
That, that, that they felt a feelin' of like
They felt a lil' fucked up in they stomach
But, they was inspired 'cause they knew they, they, they had somethin' to see the dream for, you know?
I done seen a lot of shit, I ain't never seen a, a young nigga as consistent as you that has affected the world in such a positive way since, you know, Michael Jackson
And then, when you've finally got the crib (All you do is lie to me)
You did it like, not even none of us did it, you feel me? Uhm
Nah, I mean I did it like that, I ain't gon' lie, I ain't gon' lie to you
I did it like that, but, I ain't never been affected by another nigga crib in the way that did it to inspire me
How cats told me that he'd been inspired (All you do is lie to me)
And felt that feelin' in they gut, like "I gotta work harder" (Need more than a homie)
Well I mean workin' harder just to compete, bro, for real, for real
It's either you fuckin' in the game or you're out the game
Nigga, I'm back in this motherfucker, let's get some money
It's over, nigga, you have arrived, top five, end of discussion
May God bless you, Inshallah, you know what I'm sayin'?
This your brother, Diddy, take that
And thank you for the inspiration, jheeze



This is the best i am alive because nobody thinks better than me
El noche se está yendo de la on
Oh Oh
No oh
Está bien ahora mismo
This is
It




[Part I]

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

[Verse: Drake]
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

[Part I]

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Say she want to eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'
Anything she want, she cashin' out without no problems
How you gon' love a nigga that ain't got love for your mama?
You can die today, it ain't gon' save me nothin' but drama (Super)

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up

[Verse: Future]
Pluto
Help me fight my demons off, know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a cougar, she didn't wanna leave
Treat her like garbage, my heart was on my sleeve
Should've chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if you can get it out the creep?
Why should I have trust for you? You ain't get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you? You ain't kneelin' to my feet
Why should I be carin' when I know I can't be beat?
See how the ice be glarin' when I come through and retrieve
It's easy to know it's us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes, I go Richard Mille
In another tax bracket, you niggas beneath me
Who causin' a racket in Jamaica on the weekend?
Half a ticket on vacation, I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy 'cause my money long like Stevie
Stay down with my son, right or wrong, FBG shit (Freebandz)
How you gon' be gang? You bang if you rich, what's in your bloodline?
Come in with some Talibans, everythin' gettin' gunned down
Halloween gang in this bitch, shit gettin' scary
Three hundred thousand for the cheapest ring, cost a Bentley truck, I'm legendary, lil' bitch
Hot, off the thermometer, lil' bitch
Hotter than fish grease, lil' bitch
My ring cost a big B as well as my wrist
I'm gettin' money like this, can't tell problems exist
I wake up fresh every day like I'm goin' to take a pic
Hermes hit my main line 'cause they know I'm lit
Stuffed a hundred-fifty racks in your purse, lil' bitch
And when I wake up, go surf in your pussy, hit

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Say she wanna eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'
Switchin' up my bitch, I leveled up and went exotic
How you gon' love a nigga that ain't buyin' a Birkin for your mama?
You can die today, I swear I still won't break my promise (Pluto)

[Chorus: Future]
Make love on the weekend as usual
Take drugs, goin' up, oh, that's usual
Every time she come, big spender
Every time I put my chains on, big spender

[Interlude: Future]
It's cool, man, got red bottoms on
Life is good, you know what I mean? Like

Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
I can't entertain all that flodgin'
I ain't been the same since they crossed me
You know how they do when you poppin'
You know Baby can't do all that talkin'
I got fools tryna sue up in Boston
I got dudes tryna sue down in Florida
I got hoes in L.A., got a new boo from Georgia
A milli', saved up to give to my daughter
Over one hundred K to Drew Findling, my lawyer (Let's go)
Six digits on cases, we beat it like Tina (Mmh)
Baby all on the TV, that's easy
I mixed mid with the gas and I bought me a Bimmer (Yeah)
Now I pull up in Ghosts, they ain't see me (Casper)
I know she gon' fuck, I ain't askin' (Uh-huh)
F&N like a prop, this shit plastic (Phew)
Fuck around and get popped just for laughin' (Boom)
Put that boy in a box, pick a casket
I go take that ho to Dior, pick a shoe (Let's go)
Kickin' shit with your whore, that's my boo
You can go put hardwood on the floor with the hoop (Hoop)
We like uppin' the score, we gon' shoot (Ball)
I never pick up when she call me (Brr, brr)
Help the bitch start a business, she bossin' (Uh-huh)
Like to wake up to sex like it's coffee (Sex)
Big baguettes on my neck, this shit cost me
Cartier, Audemar, Audemar or the Rolex (Let's go)
I been broke before, bet I won't go back
When she walk through the door, take that iron, make her hold that (Hold that)
They ain't seen me go out like a ho yet (Ho)
You know these lil' niggas got ho ways
Make 'em come air it out like the old days (Uh-huh)

My boy off a pill, need an OJ (Yeah, bitch)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Spent thirty racks on a rap bitch, could've went and bought a brick, woah
Quarter million worth of chains, ask Icebox, everybody lit, woah
It ain't no coppin' deuces, nigga, that's your man, everybody get it, woah
Made a few mil', made a few hits, fuckin' everybody bitch
Got somethin' to lose so I stay with a shooter
Got game from a G.O.A.T., I know how to maneuver
She kinda cute, really somethin' to do
I got somethin' to do, so I gave her to Pluto, huh
Hundred thousand for a body, go inside the house and everybody get it, huh
Got a plug on exotic, overnight 'em, floodin' everybody's city
Extra three-fifty, might buy me a Richie
This shit gettin' ridiculous, sip syrup wrong, get sick
Spot in Toronto, just show me the real ones
Give me a few months, I'll be servin' the 6, woah
Rolls truck, four bucks, all white guts, call it good luck, woah
Neck lit, wrist lit, look, don't touch, reach, you get busted
Hop out a Phantom, they think it's Houdini
Seven-fifty one day, I bought two Lamborghinis
Hundred racks spent on a four carat diamond
I didn't propose, but I bought her a ring
They had my bro, had to let that boy go
He had stick to the code, he ain't tell 'em a thing, uh
Ballin' like we won a championship, yeah
Everybody get a ring, huh

[Chorus: Future]
Yeah, hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemar-ed the bitch, woo

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: "Nobody's workin' as hard as you"
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

[Chorus: Drake & Jay-Z]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Ay Guru tell, tell homegirl to open that Ace right there...)
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights'll make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
Mm, I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — this'll do

[Chorus: Drake]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go


[Verse 1: Lil' Pope]
Only videos  connect me to Phamous people
And had dreams that one day I'll be these people
Passion so great, equate that to Kanye's Ego
Let me take a break, Hi fam I miss you people
From humble beginnings like Christ in a manger
We looking out to being everywhere  Power Ranger
Just like Guinness, greatness been my nature
Call this my Pep Talk but I'm no Guardiola
Ha!
If only wishes were horses, I'll  be riding on that POLO like Ralph Lauren
Then I just flourish, move from dawn to morning
Always fly, that nigga Pope is so flawless
I Ball like J, and I ain't talking Jordan
Sing my heritage something like Morgan
Flow on keys, make you feel it in your organs
Bars bigger than the arms of Hulk, Hogan
But I'll be waiting for my moment
Show love to my thugs and single women
Even if all you see around is bad omen
Keep pushing till you see the light up, fulfilment
What you waiting dude, see what we came through?
'Member we been on this move, since our A moon
Now you believe me if I say dreams do come true
Used to love Rumor, Kendrick, Lu(pe) and Nas too
Now see weytin this guy do
Making critics go sick with the attitude
I should be in Yeezy's clique cos I'm so GOOD
Yo Drizzy hook me up, beat is so full soulful


[Hook: Drake's Voice]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up (LIGHT UP!)
Wait until the sun goes down, we gon' make this
Bitch light up (LIGHT UP!)
Even when the sun goes down I'm a make it go

[Verse 2: Lil' Pope]
(Aah!) Who would've thought that  from the background
I'll be the same person now leading in the front-line
Michael Jackson vision though I never back-slide
Now e be like say I get chaw Goodluck pass Jonathan
So Be4 we shine, word to Kojo-Cue
Have dreams of doing things they say that you can't do
Me and my success book an appointment, No rendezvous
I See Notorious in my mirror, get that Bigger view
Let's Roll-on charley, now that's a Sure Thing
Now my success is guaranteed like its a LeBron Ring
Money in my youth is like Y(fm) so I'm yearning (for more)
Lessons in our lives are like stripes that we earning (Common)
If you dey hustle for real show your light up
Just say, I can be the answer
Not a Nissan, but Christ a  Pathfinder
And be ever-ready to beat the odds, u a Punter (panther)
Money makers, now see what money made us
Partying every night, now I look kinda faded
Drinks up in the air, let's toast to these haters
Imma Tell u like Drake told me, bye TAKE CARE!!!


[Hook: Drake's Voice]

[Verse]
Hands are tied
Someone's in my ear from the other side
Tellin' me that I should pay you no mind
Wanted you to not be with me all night
Wanted you to not stay with me all night
I know, you know, who that person is to me
Doesn't really change things

[Chorus]
I know you're scared of dating, falling for me
Shorty, surely you know me
Right here for you always
You know, I don't ever change
Right here for you always
You know I don't ever change
Right here for you

[Bridge]
Imaan you make me want to do things, love you
Like I'm supposed to
You make me want to love you
Like I'm supposed to
You make me want to love you
Like I'm supposed to, remind you
Ayy


[Chorus]
I know you're scared of dating, falling for me
Shorty, by now you know me
Right here for you always
You know, I don't ever change
Right here for you always
You know I don't ever change
Right here for you



[Verse 1: Drake & Lykke Li]
Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinkin' of
But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
'Cause you don't know who I was before you
And basically, to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm

[Chorus: Drake]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you

[Verse 2: Drake & Lykke Li]
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I, mmm

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit in love with me

[Verse 3: Drake]
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a

[Chorus: Drake]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you, oh
Oh, oh




I never would've dreamed in a million years I’d see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin’ army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought
Standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin’ but problems
And now they’re sayin' I’m in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on Ha ha ha! I’m just playin'


[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Getting sober for a day got me feeling too low (Oh)
They tryna make me slow down
Tryna tell me how to live, I'm about to lose control (Lose control, oh)
Well they can watch me fuck it up all in one night
I'm in my city in the summer, camo'd out, leather booted, kissing bitches in the club
They wanna threesome (Threesome), then some (Then some)
Spend whatever come in, fuck an income
Me and my niggas we ain't never going broke
And you, have to, do it all
Just to know where it gets you
Living dreams we can never afford
Now, we sitting in the back, sayin'

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake, dawg, this the shit you need God for
How long do you think it's gon' take for y'all to fall?
That's a serious question, 'cause I seriously question all of y'all
Been touring the world, man, I've done spent racks in all the malls
And they know my story, flaws and all
I still got plaques hanging wall to wall, dawg
She just offered a strip tease, but she don't look like Demi Moore
Hips all on 45, waist all on 24
And it's all love in the city, still scream, "XO!" when that Henny pour
But I'm that boy, not just any boy, what the fuck you think that I'm in it for?
Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince, but they know, I'm king
Chubbs might hold that thing, if he get caught, he'll be home by spring
Things I shouldn't share, I mean, for the sake of my career
I'm not tryna stunt, I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear
This the shit that I live for with the people I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake, dawg, this the shit you need God for
This that shit we really gotta talk about in person
There's some shit I need to work on, but I know you see me working, nigga, Champagne


[Chorus: The Weeknd]
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for

[Intro: Future]
Hendrix
Yeah
Aqua
Ah
(I woke up like this)

[Chorus: Future]
Reportin' live from the fuckin' gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' but some big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money, bitch

[Verse 1: Future]
Reportin' live from the gutter
I'll buy this motherfucker, talkin' big money shit, bitch
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talking ten mil' just to get our assets
I know them tears still fallin' now on my last bitch
This money make me hungry, I'm a savage
I seen the stars lining up, you couldn't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic, counted up and started laughing, ah
I went back inside the attic, counted up and started laughing, ah (Freebandz)
Ah, Cuban links hanging on my wrist, I was on welfare
Wake up in the house, I look up, I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see hell everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean, I ain't start drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean, my niggas still there
Just imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pool sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that's gon' keep it real now
Got a lot of pretty bitches, I just pay they bills now
Money make her feel good, but damn she make me feel good
Known for getting that guala out in Europe, but I'm still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a model, fuck her like I'm on my last damn dollar


[Chorus: Future]
Reportin' live from the fuckin' gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' but some big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money, bitch

[Verse 2: Drake]
Reporting live from the gutter
I will buy this motherfucker, it's not even a discussion, woo
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gon' end up dippin' with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her trippin' off the yah-yah
Pillow talking, dishing out on all y'all, yeah
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take what's coming
Live from the gutter, dawg, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets, but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dawg, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dawg, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dawgs that go Karrueche with the chopsticks, woo
And we gon' miss you
They don't want no smoke, they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through, and I'm


[Chorus: Future]
Reportin' live from the fuckin' gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' but some big money shit
Reportin' live from the damn gutter
Swear to God, I'll buy this motherfucker, ah



[Intro]
J–j–j–just in my zone, I close my figures up
All your hoes chose me, nigga, calm down

[Verse 1]
Louis pouch across my body, this is not for fashion
This is not a playground – ain't no fist fight, bitch, I'm blastin'
Niggas say they lookin' for me like I'm not right here, man
If I tatted tears, I'd be cryin' to my beard, man
Bitch, I'm tryna fuck, I've been inside for thirteen years now
I've been on so many flights, it's like my record's clear now
A.K.A. the man, A.K.A. I never ran
Don't make me turn this red light on your head like you Roxanne
Only talk to bosses, not the second-in-command
Niggas bringin' talks to me, you better have a plan
'Cause they don't have a cure for all my pain
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to my name

[Chorus]
Gyah, gyah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and it's not a fuckin' game
Gyah, gyah! You and I, we're not the same
Posted like Ibaka, got your wifey runnin' brains
She was there with boydem, kicked my front door off the frame
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Trap, trap, trappin' in the rain
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Just know I'm a shooter first and rap is not my thing
A.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my—

[Verse 2]
Hidin' in the racks
I don't pay tax, twelve on my back
Might drive the Caddy around but I never lack
Baka not with the shit? So yeah, who tellin' you that?
I went to jail the day they released Men in Black
When I came out, Timberlake was bringin' Sexy Back
Facts, nigga! Facts!
I fell in love with my strap
Named my son Milli 'cause I want a milli' to stack
Gyah, gyah! Go run and tell that
You niggas move like the cops, don't make me pepper your block
Out the window while the whip's movin', that's a hell of a shot
Fuck all my opps, I'll put you niggas on FOX

[Chorus]
Gyah, gyah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim

[Verse 1]
Man, fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Uh, uh, fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it’s six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout to all my Asian girls, Dim Sum
Shots came I don’t know where they descend from
Probably some bad hoes, I’m 'bout to take your hemp from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I’m just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don’t I got that shit the world, wanna hear again?
Don’t Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me, paint drying
I’m never tripping over anything that ain't mine
I’m hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It’s been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I didn't notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
And the kids wearing crowns over here and everything is alright

[Produced by Chase N. Cashe and Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Outro: Drake's Grandmother]
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that. So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you...

[Intro: Choir & Rick Ross]
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me
All we wanted was an opportunity
Just Blaze! Lord knows!

[Verse 1: Drake & Rick Ross]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (Woo!)
Places they say they've been, we actually going for real (Woo!)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping (Woo!)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy (Woo!)
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (Huh!)
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Huh! You know I love this
YOLO, You Only Live Once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal
(M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink (Huh!)
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (Woo!)
Villa on the water with the wonderful views (Views)
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews (Jews)
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss (Huh!) came to buy the bar (Huh!)
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (Woo!)
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R (Woo!)
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Every day them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae (Anna Mae)
I run the gang but the ladies think I'm running game (Running game)
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate (Fornicate)
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothing short of great (Huh!)


[Verse]
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Muthafuck them other niggas be the state of mind
Got them haters on the job like it’s a 9 to 5
Getting money, mind ya business and stay out of mine
50 thousands for this rolly homie
I die tonight just bring my jewelry to the ceremony
Lord knows I be shittin’ on ‘em
Hottest nigga since that weather out in Arizona
Sleeping on me hope you choke and fall into a coma
Smell the frangrance know the money be the new aroma
I’m just spazzing out, denims carry large amounts
Got them bitches throwin’ pussy what the asses out
True story, new glory
Money stacking taller than a two story
Real niggas countin money, never gets boring
Last year I made a million of the state touring
Fuck boys, know what you talking bout
I run my own team, ain't no room for mascots
Look around, peep at the winners circle
We the niggas touching paper like a social worker
Plus them pistols keep them shells like a ninja turtle
Wear rubber, cus these Spanish bitches so fertile
Lord Knows I be going hard
RIP my nigga Daniel, remember that garage
Long nights, before that rap shit
I was thinking moving keys like a locksmith
No sir, the cops
Them crackers dirty, I just hope you keep ya name clear
Waiting for a nigga, trippin’ I just stand still
I ain't trippin’ I just stand still
Lord knows that I’m stressed out
Walking through these roadblocks with my chest out
Damn, 23 and made a million dollars
Fucking put a quarter million dollars round a collar
Couple more to cop a Phantom I ain't talking opera
They sya my flow sick I should see a fucking doctor
Real niggas in ya presence
Chopper raise a nigga head like you present
Broward County I am that
Only nigga in my city riding Maybach’s
Motivation, motivation, my niggas fans are dead
They only location?
And thats word to my daughter
I’m just tryna make it your headquarters
Word up

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
What's up nigga
Yo, yo, nigga 103
Yo, yo, nigga 103
Yo, yo, let's go
Let's go


[Intro: John Taylor & Drake]
I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah


[Chorus: Drake]
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you


[Chorus: Drake]
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Outro: 600 Breezy]
This is the 6’s year
Six hundreds instead of six, OVO
You know we’ll be rockin' our asses out
To my big brother Drizzy
You know what I’m sayin'?
More Life, 6 to the world, gang shit



Did I lose you
Did I
Did I
Did I lose you


[Intro: Dennis Graham]
Hey, Instagram
This song I've been writing, oh, for a few months
I don't know, I, I started writing it about family
Just came up now, so
Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck
(Yeah, family)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts


[Interlude: Drake & Dennis Graham]
You got some liquor at the house?
Yeah
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
I don't see it
Okay, hahaha

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy
Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts


[Outro: Drake & Dennis Graham]
Yes, sir
(Baby)
Hold on, hold on
(Let me tell you something about me)
(I really do know, I know who I wanna be)
Woo
Lord, I already passed on all that (Woo)
You go 'head on, haha

[Drake]

Damn, another 20 missed calls
I love her and I hate her
It's a funny twist y'all
Can't stand her it when she in town
But miss her when she gone
Truth be told
I'd rather be with her than alone
But fights break out
And neighbors call 5-0
Screamin you the most foul bitch I know!
Forever mine wherever I go
Sex pistols out (bang) die slow
Nah die slower than that
Just co-llapse all over my matt-ressss
Who shot cha that nigga ain't finished
So once again I find myself in it (click-clack)
Just let me take a minute
Round 2 is in the chamber
All you gotta do is spin it
Aim for the heart
Battle of the sexes
All's fair love and war casualties expected

Man, I used to look up to you
How could you do this to me

[Chorus]
(Sample: From Time by Drake featuring Jhené Aiko)
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you've been through more than most of us

[Verse]
I graduated but didn't attend the ceremony
Because the honour wasn't really much to cherish for me
Imagine being on stage with teeth barely showing
Stomach in chest out, with the camera's glowing
For a qualification you'll never glorify
More than getting excessive plays on Spotify
Or Soundcloud, around town they know the guy
The calling was too loud to nullify
A hundred times, I swear, I tried to deviate
And I was wishing that Modimo could just mediate
I broke down, no tow truck to see me straight
Psychologist saying that I'm in need of space
But I'm already lonely, though I'm hardly alone
On a journey I shouldn't be embarking alone
Pack of 10s and a 6 pack I party alone
Say hello to the real me I promised to show
Hi, nice to meet you
I'm hoping that we can connect as people
I'm learning with time to silence my ego
But, being humble don't mean that I can't be lethal
I'm killing you if I need to, I'm killing you if I need to
Your honesty can sometimes lead me on to a sequel
I'd probably be a nice guy if I wasn't so evil
Because I'm vulnerable the most whenever I'm living see through
Transparent it's hurting like I'm a homophobe
And 'fuck you' to all the homophobes
My cousin's the realest person I've ever known
And he was living gorgeous way before they invented phones
So get a load of this reality
For all the tough times that you battle in
A little bounce you can party to
And heres the needed magic to get you through all your Varsy Blues
.. Yes


[Chorus]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you've been through more than most of us

[Interlude]



[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol (Mike WiLL Made-It)

Uh, pussy-ass nigga, stop hatin'

And these hoes love me like Satan, man
Yeah, fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup, she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, "'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said, "Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"
Slick Tunechi

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, real nigga, fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges
Lil Tunechi

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Lil Wayne]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol (Yeah)
I got some down bitches I can call (What's hatnin'?)

[Intro: Meek Mill]
I'm ready

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Love my team, I'll die for them niggas, ahh (Real rap)
Hating-ass niggas in my circle, had to cut 'em out (Cut 'em)
Gold-digging-ass bitches, fuck 'em then it's fuck em all (Fuck 'em)
Had my niggas locked down, so I'm screaming fuck the law (I'm riding)
Strap on, clip bent, riding in the Cadillac (Caddy)
Jack boys looking at me, and they know I ain't having that (Uh-uh)
Let them niggas pump you up, Like you just had an asthma attack
I'll hit you with that rat-a-tat, change your mind like "Matter fact"
Bow! We just like the Mafia (Mob), body you
Break the code of silence, nigga, we gon' 'Luminati you (Yeah)
Pull up in that black thing, "Phantom of the Opera" (Skrt!)
We be selling fish scales, just to make tilapia (Yeah)
I be up all night, chasing down them Benjamins
You should see this money, all these pretty hoes I'm swimming in
Walking to the stage, singing "Not Afraid" by Eminem
Take me to the boss, bitch, I don't deal with middlemen (Nope, ha!)

[Chorus: Drake & Meek Mill]
I'm about whatever, man, fuck what they talking about
Their opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Awww, and we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night (All night!) whole crew in here
'Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Awww, man, I love my team, man, I love my team (Yeah)
I'll die for them niggas, awww (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
If Omelly tell me, "Fuck her," I'ma fuck her (Fuck her)
And if my nigga like her, swear to God that I won't touch her (Never)
'Cause loyalty is everything, them niggas like my brothers
If you don't see me with them everyday
Most likely I don't trust 'em, so it's fuck 'em
I'm a northsider nigga (North), with a southsider attitude (Southside)
Got the streets already, now I'm coming to take the avenues (Gimme that!)
Broke—them niggas love you
You get money, they get mad at you (Haters)
"Like why Tip ain't sign you yet?"
'Cause I ain't never ask him to (Never)
Haaaa! Just look at my wrist (Bling)
You look like that and I look like this (This)
I'm looking Rozayish and you looking like Chris (Ha!)
Old played-out-ass nigga, hating on me, broke bitch
It's whatever man, fuck what they talking 'bout
Niggas diss me in they raps, see me, try to talk it out (Frauds!)
I just look 'em in they eyes, it ain't shit to talk about
'Cause if we catch 'em without the crowd, we gon' chalk 'em out
Ha!

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talking 'bout
Their opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Awww, and we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
'Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Man, I love my team, man, I love my team
I'll die for them niggas, awww

[Intro: G-Eazy]
Yeah, haha
Gerry, RITTYBO, I got you, haha, yeah

[Verse 1: G-Eazy, G-Eazy & RITTYBO]
Ever since you left the city, you
You can't seem to make up your mind (Ayy)
Miss the town, I wish that it were still '06
I wanna backtrack like we ain't lost time (Yeah), yeah
But ever since I ever left the city, I
I took momma shopping on Rodeo drive (Ayy)
Reset the Rolex and switch time
Time has passed, now I'm on a different vibe (Ayy, yeeh)
And now the path that you're on is goin' nowhere
If I don't text you, don't mean that I don't care (It don't)
I still got some feelings for you with some hope there (For real)
Could see us gettin' back but you ain't trying to go there (You ain't tryna go there)
You know that I got you, after all that we been through
Better act like you know who (Yeah)
Someone said I don't love you, you been lied to (Ayy)
And the streets won't love you like I do (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: RITTYBO]
Ever since I left the city, you
You can't seem to make up your mind
Never wanna be there for me
But you only always take my time (Uh)
Ever since I left the city, I, well, I can't deny
Even though I say, "I don't care," I still pray for you every night
You know that I got you, better act like you know who

[Chorus: RITTYBO & G-Eazy]
These streets just don't love you like I do
Love you like I do, like I do
Love you like I do, like I do
Love you like I do, like I do
Love you like I do (Straight up), like I do (You know)
Love you like I do (Yeah)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy, G-Eazy & RITTYBO]
Somehow, still, I want you
Crazy how old memories, they haunt you
Didn't have it now like a Saint Laurent shoe
Still tryna figure what point I lost you
Was chasin' the wrong thing
Wrong crowd with the drama that they all bring
It's the same song and dance if they all sing
You're a queen, hope you never choose the wrong king
Is you mine? I ain't tryna buy the wrong ring
Both knew that we was more than a long fling
But you got lost in this world, tryna find you
And the streets won't love you like I do (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: RITTYBO]
Ever since I left the city, you
You can't seem to make up your mind
Never wanna be there for me
But you only always take my time (Uh)
Ever since I left the city, I, well, I can't deny
Even though I say, "I don't care," I still pray for you every night
You know that I got you, better act like you know who

[Chorus: RITTYBO & G-Eazy]
These streets just don't love you like I do
Love you like I do, like I do
Love you like I do, like I do
Love you like I do, like I do
Love you like I do (Straight up), like I do (You know)
Love you like I do (Yeah)

[Outro: G-Eazy, G-Eazy & RITTYBO]
There, what ya need when you call me
Freaky in the bed when you need me (Uh)
There, what ya need when you call me
Freaky in the bed when you need me (Uh)
Ayy, rock with me, baby
'Cause I wanna fall in love you with you, maybe
Ayy, rock with me, baby
'Cause I wanna fall in love you with you, maybe
There, what ya need when you call me
Freaky in the bed when you need me
There, what ya need when you call me
Freaky in the bed when you need me


[Intro: Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love (ooh)
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive from love (ooh yeah)
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Hook: Diddy]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try

[Pre-Hook: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried
But all for nothin' I’m afraid to say
Oh


[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself (No, woah)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be loving you no more (No, no, baby)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin' to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now it's changed
My life, ain't the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me

[Pre-Hook: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I’m afraid to say
Oh, oh, oh

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money & Drake]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more  (I can't) (Diddy)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, no, baby) (Drizzy baby, uh uh)
I love you more than I love myself


[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure

[Bridge: Dirty Money]
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Can't you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more

[Intro: Birdman]
Yeah, YMCMB
Stunna man, money mix, ya understand?
Mula crazy, let's get it
Blatt!

[Chorus: Tyga]
Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Yeah, red ribbon, ducking Feds 'til we pass out
Birdcage, duck the shine 'til they let him out
There's more money now, and we done flipped the draught
Hella choppers, clip pulled, nigga, Junior out
G'd up, I took it from the G-code
Presidential suites, with this cash flow
Uptown gangsta, VL hustla
Third Ward general, Young Cash Money

[Verse 2: Brisco]
Before I leave home, I kiss my babies, hope I return safely
Knowin' the odds against me, these devils, they tryin' to break me
I'm still loyal, my habits became lavish
Dreams of new endeavors, pub deals and owning masters
And my homeboys, aid to my conditions
I made 'em all managers, execs and assistants
And most of 'em don’t understand, some won’t listen
We might fall off, throw fits and get missing
But you're still my dawg, ha, and my big homie spoil me
I feel cause I’m the youngest, he expects a little more from me
So I try to stay humble, and if you can see my vision
You can see us Cash Money 'til the motherfucking ending
Brisco

[Chorus: Tyga]
Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
Uh, YMCMB baby (Mack Maine!)
Before I leave home, kiss my girl on the cheek and then I say a prayer
If looks was bullets, I woulda been dead from stares
I bypassed the elevator and I took the stairs
Now the hard work got me ridin' in Bentleys and Lears
Homie I'm so prepared, on point like infrareds
I live my life, so to die, I ain’t never scared
And when I drop, I'm not gon' flop, I'm no Andre Ware
I can't see you haters, guess my vision's impaired
My niggas already there, yes we done got that title
You other rappers losing weight, minus the lipo
Breath of fresh air, pump lung money
Cat scan say "Cash Money", heart bleed Young Money, one hunny

[Verse 4: Lil' Twist]
Yeah, Twist! Young Money
Before I leave home, well mannered, nice, respectful young man
Momma taught me well but daddy taught me through a jail cell
Raised as a prince and Young Money then took me in
Made it official, YM young'n, CMB, what's happenin'?
Yeah, I gotta do it for my hood
See before I stepped off the block, I told all them niggas I would
Let’s do it for the OC, I put in work out on TV
And step one over a G, now put your hands for lil old me, yeah

[Chorus: Tyga]
Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know

[Verse 5: Bow Wow]
Chyeah, stay true to my team (Who that?)
YMCMB a-a.k.a the greatest (Le'go)
Yeah, that’s why they hate us (Hate)
Went from layaway (To what?) to rocking all the latest, fashion
Name a model chick I ain’t smashing (Ha)
New cars for all my homies when I bring that cash in (C'mon)
Never had my father in my life, he was a deadbeat
Moms worked two jobs to keep Jordans on my feet
Now that I’m on, ain't shit to worry 'bout
I bought my momma a mansion and moved the damn south
Now what you talking bout? Got my Bugatti on the way Stunna
Money coming in fast like the Road Runner, Bow!

[Verse 6: Cory Gunz]
Whistle for my family, my label and my set
It's Young Money 'til my day the death, tell the rest take a rest
Thoroughbreded and blessed, my grind stressed
Sometimes yet nevertheless, a young'n shining with the best
Promised my momma one day I’ll be a rhymer, she left
But I love her so much, it’s like she never took a step
Reality showed me them colors that some of us couldn't
Look at you now that we all what you thought, some of us wouldn't
Said he gettin that dough right, ready jetting from police
Petty better than rolled dice, some cold nights, they deadin' us, no light
But I'm here now, and we here like something, nothing compared like
CMB, I’m privileged in this legacy, that’s real life
My brother's keeper, protect me from my friends Lord
My enemies’ll bleed ya, choking off anesthesia
Throw my signs high, I'm recognized worldwide, worldwide
I’m in it to get whatever it cost me, it’s true loyalty

[Chorus: Tyga]
Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know, before I leave home




Uh, uh, yeah. Lube up, get ready boys, Little Crusty D is going in raw. Yeah, lets go! Pube jungle, Lustful uncle, my toaster is plugged in and ready to go! Stick my dick in and watch the cum flow! My meat is wide, it's tender and tough. I love it when my uncle handles me rough. Crunchy asshole, writhing erection, Little Crusty D loves circumflexion. Bending shaft, cracking cock, smash my balls with a cinder block. My goliath of a cock can destroy entire villages in one fell swoop. I am currently searing my defiled shaft on a Lodge Cast Iron Frying pan. My balls hang down 4 inches, I should seek immediate medical attention. They continue to sag lower everyday. Little Crusty D is out


[Intro: Drake & Ronald Isley]
Ayy

Now I gotta tell you how lucky I am
(Oh, now you know)
This shit could have went a hundred different ways on a thousand different days for real
Yeah, whoop, ayy

[Verse: Drake]
On my way to the boat like I ain't just have on a coat when I landed
Owl branded
Perched at the edge of the branches
They don't wanna talk mansions, mine look like a campus
And I'm all about my brothers like the niggas I'm samplin'
I'll leave you red-shirted like the twins from Kansas
Really livin' my dreams I used to have in my aunt's crib
Might throw a Rockefeller chain on in the Hamptons
This shit sound like I'm parked in the alley by ransom
My uncle went bankrupt and he was the last hope
My faith started to dwindle 'cause that was the cash flow
My mom would never walk again, that's what the doc said
So much medication, I was worried she'd drop dead
For real
And I was the good guy, my friends were the hotheads
Times when I thought I should of stuck with my old friends
I might've been at the end of my rope on both ends
The kids I went to high school with got trust funds
But we had more fun, trust
Textin' my promoter, homie beggin' for one plus
Girls wrote me off, didn't think I'd become much
Dinner and a movie all for nothin', that's tough love
Meanwhile, rappers from other cities is cuttin' up
We ain't had the means to really make it, we comin' up
But local niggas actin' like we made it and runnin' up
My heart beatin' fast 'cause I needed to toughen up
We needed to huddle up
I felt like we was doin' all we could but it wasn't enough
Spent a year in Brampton with my girl, just cuddlin' up
'Til one of my niggas hit my phone like you want it or what?
And now, the sound is champion
The singles is dancin', the pills is Ambiens
The lightin' is ambient
The housewives is outside the booth 'cause they can't be in
"Oh, you fancy, huh?"
Oh yeah, I'm the fanciest
They said summer was canceled but I got plans and shit
Where my advances is?
Ladies, it's June, July, where all the Cancers is?
Show me your hands and shit
Even if you ain't a Cancer, throw up your hands to this
'Cause most of y'all cancerous
Michael B. Jordan call you right now, you answerin'
Even if you got a man that love you, you scandalous
You gon' take the chance and shit
You know that relationship is probably in shambles
And you know you a fan of his
Know if he gon' bring you to Miami, you scramblin'
And pack all your luggage, get on the plane and land in it
Yeah, I'm just talkin' outta pocket now, I know y'all sick of me
I looked at the score and y'all can't be countin' the victories
It's still all love between us, despite all the history
It's still October forever, minus the trickery
Talk about a flip the switch challenge
It's been challengin' for ten years
'Cause niggas been out here switchin' on me
And showin' how much realer that some of they bitches can be
This shout goes out to Hov 'cause it's him and then me
For real



Savage love did somebody did somebody get to fucks but i still want those two fucks oh babe love me oh babe oh babe babe babe love love me me savage love did somebody




[Intro: RALI]
Yeah...
I just kind of feel like...
I just need to -- get this off my chest

[Verse: RALI]
People always waiting on you to take the first step
Cause they're afraid of the pain of drowning in disappointment
When that's the price of success
It's a shame, it's a shame

The rap game will never be the same, be the same
The world is getting colder
And I'm just getting older
Cross paths with old friends
But I just change lanes

When people look at you like, "It's a bird. It's a plane."
They stand up on your shoulders and the view is insane
Empire state of mind
I'm running out of patience
I'm running out of time
It's no wonder that my rhymes are terminally ill...

Sick is underrated
Unlucky 13
And I'm the Dr. Foreman
Headed to my Dr. House
Just to get some Dr. Cuddy
And a new IV;

Infinite Vocabulary
What's its like to be a woman?
No Tyler Perry

Not that I'm a fag, but I ask
Cause relationships are difficult
And women get sensitive to the 10th power
Starting from the day a nigga pop her cherry

But that's just my opinion right?
And opinions are just feelings right?
I guess I just like to view opinions
As events without a witness
So rewind this, just to make sure that you hear it right

Fuck that nigga you with baby, you know I can hit it right
But I know I got a girl
See this the type of shit be going on in my mind
And it's heavy on my mind
Like my brain's in the gym
And my Frontal Lobe, is on a 1,000 Pound Curl like…

Like... Wait... Wait

My imagination's kinda scary
Bare with me for a minute please
I put my feelings in the grave where my soul buried
God don't you see me on my knees?

Please save me from my nightmares
I just wanna live my dreams
But I don't wanna play for fun
I would rather play for keeps…

[Bridge: Drake]
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up


[Verse]
I'm tryna do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin' rich s'posed to solve that
And these days, women make offers
And who the hell am I to say (No, no, no)?
My ex sendin' late night texts
'Cause she don't know how to let (Go, go, go)
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin' in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear
Sayin' she should be the one I see every time that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Suburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old handprints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux, I don't really give a fuck
And we only gettin' older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
It's funny when you comin' in first, but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last


[Outro]
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her, oh-oh
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up

[Verse 1: Drake]
Low-key Peter Parker flow
Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though
Private flights no hassle I just park and go
I’m the highlight like when markers glow
Oooooh, look what you created
Only got yourself to blame, I remember when you hated ooooh
Now you tell me take my time
How bout I just take your city make that muthaf-cker mine uh ha
I’m a underground king ho, I sit tall, I swang low
The game ain't always fair and thats the thing though
You can play your heart out everyone don’t get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain’t never answering
You ain’t figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can’t come in
Call me Ron Burgundy y'all the other anchormen
Whats on the news trick, gossiping bout music
Cause rumours I’m the new shit and guess what it’s true bitch

[Hook: Drake]
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it


[Refrain: Drake, Big Sean]
I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
It's so amazing
You woulda thought we made it up
Man I was made to be greater
Made for the grind
Made for the lights
Made for the shine

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ay look, I need less friends more bread
Less talk more head
Used to ride escorts now I get escorted (do it)
I’m just waiting on my cue dog no pledge
Said she like all girls I turn that bitch co-ed
Threw on my track team handed my baton to her
Passed her blew her off, I chronic Veronica
Who got up on my nerves so I had to platonic her
No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica
I’m the head of my estate ain't that ironic huh
I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer
Ohh, I’m who they going ape shit over
I’m who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over
See broads over niggas but business over broads
See business equals money and money’s over all
I’m tryna move my momma from the ghettos to the meadows
Well she can’t stay in that fucking hood forever, forever
Was made for that Mick Jagger shit baggage check and a chick
Fast girls, faster whip, big chains master shit
Bitch I’m living everyday month yearly
Yell until you muthfuckers hear me, we made it


[Hook: Drake]
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Two door Bugatti coupe, I call it Katy Perry
Wiz Khalifa papers smoking my favorite berries
S65 I call it Rihanna
It got a red top but it's white like Madonna
Made man, you hear what I said
Having a slumber party all my bitches counting bread
Made man, also known as Papi Chulo
And I’m running straight up in the culo
My wrist always on frio, call me chilly chill
Super head from Superhead, and I really will
Californication, motivation in my pocket
Got on my blue Dickie, shout out my nigga Roccett
Still smoking sticky, it ain't no other option
Not for made niggas and I’m never stopping
I raised the bar, I set the standards
My yayo Usher Raymond, that bitch just keep on dancing

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Dollar bills on top of dollar bills
Thats all I’m throwing, if she won't lil' momma will
Made niggas, talking a lotta skrill
Eight digits a nigga tryna live
Made man, you hear what I said
I got a hundred squares if you scared, called the feds
Made men, I’m screaming dollar bills
Pop the trunk on the Porsche, there they go, dollar bills


[Verse 2: Drake]
Riding round the city, plastic cup of Henny
Find a nigga like me, truth be told, I don’t know many
I say shout my driver Lauren, that 62 with curtains
Can't see shit, I don’t know where the fuck I’m at for certain
When it boils down, I’m just a T.O. nigga
But bitches tell me that I look just like a creole nigga
New Orleans know it’s love, everytime I’m in town
Shout out my nigga Tez, that's my brother my round
Spending tomorrows money, I call it mañana
Off the rack just ain't my style, I call it designer
One of my baddest women ever, I call her Rihanna
... But that's cause her name is Rihanna!
I’m in the condo just posting watching Miami kill
I might just walk to the arena and watch it for real
Ashes to ashes, me, Rozay and Khaled
Smoking bull riders, shit moving slow as a ballad
Tattoo on your ass, it’d be nice if you show me
I’m buying bitches furs, Mike Tyson, Naomi
I’ve got the right to do it, it’s only right to do it
Love me some head, and I love a woman that likes to do it
Still love my team, ain't no other option
Not for made niggas and I’m never stopping
I’m Damon Wayans, just know that homie don’t play that
You know we run it my nigga, Young Money, Maybach


[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Dollar bills on top of dollar bills
Thats all I’m throwing, if she won't lil' momma will
Made niggas, talking a lotta skrill
Eight digits a nigga tryna live
Made man, you hear what I said
I got a hundred squares if you scared, called the feds
Made men, I’m screaming dollar bills
Pop the trunk on the Porsche, there they go, dollar bills

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Black panorama, I call it T-Pain
I got my autotune, that bitch insane
Got my revolver too, I call it Ving Rhames
You still a baby boy, we doing big things
Street niggas, you hear what I said
I got some bad news, Jabar back in the feds
Facing twenty, he just did a dime
Been out a year, look like he finna ride
Genocide, these people killing time
Throw you in a hole, you must be penalized
Soon as you see success, haters reinvest
Miami guns drive, half a million nothing less
Raised the bar, I set the standards
My yayo MC Hammer, that bitch just keep on dancing
Michael Jackson, let it moonwalk
Set it on the napkin, let it cool off


[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Dollar bills on top of dollar bills
Thats all I’m throwing, if she won't lil' momma will
Made niggas, talking a lotta skrill
Eight digits a nigga tryna live
Made man, you hear what I said
I got a hundred squares if you scared, called the feds
Made men, I’m screaming dollar bills
Pop the trunk on the Porsche, there they go, dollar bills



[Chorus]
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

[Verse 1]
God knows it
Pure mind and pure soul I possess, He knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken

[Pre-Chorus]
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

[Chorus]
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

[Verse 2]
People change, I'm not surprised
Devil's working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have tried

[Pre-Chorus]
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

[Chorus]
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

[Outro]
You put food on the table for me, aye?
Alright, fam, soft. I see you, aye?
You pay my bills, right?
It's light
You're a wasteman

Top story
Wah?




[Verse]

It's been like 5 months
And my ex still giving me hell
Bout that verse and shit
I just speak how I feel
You know keeping it real
The truth can really hurt some shit
I don't do too much talking
So don't be surprised
If I really start merking shit
Told you not be surprised
When I started merking shit
Lord please take the wheel
She just said that I'm famous
When I'm tryna stay humble
I can not drop the ball
They hoping that I fumble
Oh lord
I just made a play
You should see they face
Let me hit the Ickey Shuffle
After the touchdown
For the one time
Shoe box all the new money
So it can age well like Madonna
All my niggas focused on the future
Singing "fuck up some commas,"
She might be a sauna
But looks can really be deceiving
Mannn just look at Rihanna

[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure (man, man)
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 1]
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again (Six-six-six!)
Soon as you get in

[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 2]
Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go

[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you




Breathe through, ride through
Damn, boy, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, boy, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, boy, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, goin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out
We haven't talked in a while, we should roll

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, boy, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, boy, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure, man man
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, boy, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up
Goin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you


[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up

[Sample: Scarface]
You wanna play with us?
Okay
Say hello to my little friend

[Verse 1: Big Mike]
These here is the dog years, but motherfuckers don’t shed
I got homies I rode for, they the ones that want me dead
They don’t realize I got mob ties
Ain’t that funny guys? On my Ivan Drago shit
If he dies, he dies
Big Mike the Don, they should call me Corleone
Mafia warfare, that’s the vibe we on
Keep your friends close, enemies closer
Your friends could turn to enemies before the day is over
I learned the hard way to look over my shoulder
I guess it’s true that you grow wiser as you grow older
Hindsight’s 20/20, ain’t no point in looking back
Keep your eyes forward, get this cheese like cheddar Jack
Cut the grass, in doing so I revealed the snakes
Like Q said, we don’t conversate with the fake
Hit em with the dagger like I’m Steph Curry
Got them feeling weak like they had scurvy
I drop shit that everyone got on repeat
But when you drop, not even your friends peep
You on the move, but it look like you standing still
I’m moving on, no more wishing ill will
Cuz when you get to where I’m at
You gotta remember where you’ve been before
I know where I’m headed, I don’t need a map
Drowning Pool, “let the bodies hit the floor”

[Hook: Big Mike]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 2: Ninto]
Niggas want a verse, hop in the stu now
These niggas hating but I swear that they all fools now
I'm a risky nigga, blackout, playing pool now
And I'm blowing all these O's on the juul now
Claiming all these sets, but, is that true now?
You can catch the smoke, live, like it's you now
Claiming that he better than me, I said, who now?
These niggas been on my dick like it's glue now
Aye, tell em hop off, lil nigga, you gay
I don't do no capping, keep that shit 1K
Speeding in the freeway like I'm in GTA
I'm a big dog, lil nigga, you a stray
Don't try and come at me, you know I don't play
Catch you in the backstreets, slash, get slayed
Plug on the move, scale that shit, check the weight
New verse dropped, y'all, sorry for the wait

[Hook: Big Mike]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 3: BLKMSK]
Come up in this bitch like it’s 2017
Spark the shit up, take a picture, bitch I’m ridin clean
All up in my bag, Mike saved a spot for me
Had to keep a tab, rip it off like a fiend
All the time I keep my rhymes in my notebook
On the grind getting mine, how my coat look?
All the bitches wanna know how the show cooked
Never went half way leave you so shook
If it don’t make dollars don’t make sense
Motherfucker I got no new friends
And if you wanna test me now
Mike’ll show you how to get down motherfucker
You better slip down hit ground zero touch it
Because my mouth spit rounds: hear it, love it
And if you thought I was gone yeah I’m coming bitches
Like Kanye, Cam’ron give you consequences
A lot of these rappers is hit or misses
But every verse I spit is the real business
When I come around you lookin real timid
Put me in the batter’s box no twitches
Because I be hittin every time I swing
And you can’t even fuck with the real thing
Cause I stick with my roots like a rutabaga
While you just a Chinese bootlegger

[Hook: Big Mike]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man




{Se Pencher Sur}

[Couplet 1]
Te rappelles-tu, il n'y a pas fort longtemps
Nous marchions sur le trottoir
Innocent, te souviens-tu ?
Tout ce que nous faisions était prendre soin l'un de
L'autre

Mais la nuit était chaude
Nous étions audacieux et jeunes
Tout autour le vent souffle
Nous nous accrochions seulement pour lâcher prise

[Refrain]
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter

Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter

[Couplet 2]
Que ferons-nous lorsque nous vieillirons ?
Marcherons-nous encore dans la même voie ?
Seras-tu là à mes côtés ?
Debout et fort alors que les vagues se retournent

Quand les nuits sont longues
Je désir ardemment que tu viennes à la maison
Tout autour le vent souffle
Nous nous tiendrons seulement juste pour lâcher prise

[Refrain]
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui

[Belly - Hook]
She can make it go
Bring it high, bring it down
Take it low
Then make it go
She can make it go
Start off going fast but then she take it slow
Then make it go
She can make it

[Belly]

Now baby, now baby you know just who I am
You heard that shit with Kurupt

I can turn your long days into loud nights
Girl I flip it, turn it over, touch it make it sound like
When it come to pussy Im a connoisseur
I can fuck you till your a lot more than kinda sore
Girl Im a dog with a bone like a dinosaur

Make you climb the walls
So fly you divide the law

[Hook]

[Drake]

I tell her, I tell her
We not just any guys
I bet they're broke for a reason, no need to empathize
I tell Patrone truths, I tell you Henny lies
And you believe em all
I can see em in your eyes
I take you down like (down like)
Me without no money that don’t sound right (sound right)
I can put you on this outta town flight

And even have a driver pick u up girl what that sound like (sound like)
I gets big big money, all this money
I dont even know what to call this honey
Take so long just to get to the point where you rich
And you there and its oh so funny
I stunt so they can see me
And therefore they should know
They call me Drizzy baby
Wanna see you make it go

[Hook]
[End]




[Intro: Katherine]
Boy you make me proud
I'm so proud of you

[Verse 1: Dani, Amy, Lisa]
I like a man with a future and a past
A lil attitude problem all good it'll make it all last
Don't make it too easy boy don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair's still wet and you just took a shower
Running on the treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to yale but you probably went to Harvard
Knowing you, weekend in miami tryna study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get them done
Might have been a time when I loved him too
But you take that away cause you'll always be the one
Baby if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away

[Chorus: Christina]
I know things get hard but boy you got it
Boy you got it there you go
Can't ya tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all them other girls wanna waste your time
It's just amazing boy and all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you

[Post-Chorus: Christina]
Everything's adding up
You were the guys but
I'm not sure you were the baddest ones but you

[Verse 2: Lauren, Amy, Lisa]
B-b-b-b-bet I am
All of them girls I'm better than
Mansions in Malibu babblin
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'
And I always ride slow when I'm travelling
And my flow's so soaked gotta paddle in
Gotta ro-ro-row, gotta row you're boat
It's pink friday records and OVO
Done did the pop tour I'm the realest deal
The best legal team and the deal is ill
It's MAC, OPI and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominationg every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, lil gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I'm fli-fli-fly, I'm flyin high
Ain't got time to talk just 'Hi' and 'bye'
Baby if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away
He asked my sign
I said 'Who ares? '
I'm a star sheriff badge
And I belong, right where you see me
I ain't on the fence about it

[Chorus: Christina]
I know things get hard but boy you got it
Boy you got it there you go
Can't ya tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all them other girls wanna waste your time
It's just amazing boy and all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you

[Post-Chorus: Christina]
Everything's adding up
You were the guys but
I'm not sure you were the baddest ones but you

[Bridge: Katherine]
I don't care about the money
Just the city that I'm from
I'm a sing it til I feel it
I'm gonna go until it's done
Boy, you always work so hard
You still got my heart
You always be the one
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you

[Outro: Christina]
Everything's adding up
You were the guys but
I'm not sure you were the baddest ones but you
Know you are
Wassup boy?

[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

[Chorus: Drake]
I’m so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I’m so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I’m so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you—

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row your boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I’m fl-fl-fly, I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch!
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away, ahh
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star, sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?
Double-D up, hoes, Dolly Parton

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

[Chorus: Drake]
I’m so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I’m so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I’m so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you know you are

[Bridge: Drake]
And I know all I can say is

And I know all I can say is
I’m so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so—

[Chorus: Drake]
I’m so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I’m so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you

Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you know you are




[Hook]
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm from the city where people be gettin' lazy
Litterin' in the streets
And the club district is poppin' like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers
Money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams
And dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events
Bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot
So girls'll give up the ass

And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like Snoopy and Woodstock
Daffy and Bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane
And she back where she was
Right back on the bus
It's a shame cause now at his window
She throwin' bricks like Shaq in the clutch
You can see that's shes colder
'Cause he doesn't hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her
That he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Now up north there's five artists deservin' a listen
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through
Chances are that it ain't you
I single-handedly carry out what you can't do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple that's eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in & the out and the plan's seeming ill
Whenever I'm out in Memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm Andreena mill
Japan and Brazil, the audience screaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

[Hook]
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause




[Verse 1: Drake]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Verse 2: Drake]
I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I don’t waste time, can’t you see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy’s fucking crazy

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Spoken Word: Lil Wayne]
Y-M, bitch, everyday
Two times on Sunday
Spitta!
Check your blinkers, baby
Check your blinkers, baby
Cause, to me, look like you’ve been turning right all day, yeah
Right my way, I got a boulevard, baby
That’s right, Cash Avenue
Wall Street gangsta
Carter, y'all
Why would I lie, yeah
I ain’t rich, bitch, I’m wealthy
Young, I talk shit til I die
Come kill me, nigga
Fuck you, no homo
She like it, yeah
Boy, these motherfucking glasses I got on right now
Are so motherfucking cold

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig




[Intro]
Here we go, yeah

[Verse]
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like "Billie Jean", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time
And all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at
Or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud
To let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this my G

[Outro]
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
Here we go again


[Intro: Ericka Lee]
Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good… You still working?
Tonight… Right now? Did I go out?
Yeah, I went out, I went…
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around


[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me


[Verse 3: Drake]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
"Well, I'm sorry"

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me


[Interlude: Drake]
You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here, then

[Outro: Drake]
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that
‘Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
We really gonna be in some trouble, trouble



Phone Call (Gillio):
Hey, how you doin?
Look I just I can't stop thinking about you
I-im sorry I made a mistake
I just want to be with you
I just wanna tell you what I feel
I just need to look into your eyes...
Please...
Can I come over?"

Verse 1 (Drake):

Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I’ve been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I’ve been drinking so much
That I’ma call her anyway and say

Chorus (Drake):
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
Cause I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he’s not around

(Are you drunk right now?)

I’m just sayin’, you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’, only if you make me

Verse 2 (Gillio):
Always by myself now, I never thought I'd be without you
But it's like all this shit I did was just able to cloud you, yeah
Cloud your mind and every thought you have of me, but I just want you
To be happy so I'll fuck off and let you be

And what's most confusing is you never have the time for me
Then complain I don't do shit when you're the one too blind to see
That I had all hopes in it, you were the one that took them away
But I don't even care no more, I don't even hope or pray so
Ima tell you something, for me it's all over
You got me drunk on your lies
But now I'm all sober
Ready to move on to another
But I've still been drinking so much
So I'mma call you anyway and say

Chorus (Drake):
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he’s not around

(Are you drunk right now?)

I’m just sayin’, you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’, only if you make me

Verse 3 (Gillio):

I think I'm addicted to all this shit
And everything you put me through
You know I'd cross the world on foot just for the chance to be with you
But now you pushin' limits
Showin' up with other guys
A smile to hide the sadness but it's only a disguise
Cause all these other men have nothing on what I have to offer
I'm burnin with your love and drowning in your water
I've said once before but I'll repeat it even more
That they're just temporary while Im always at your door
I was ready to take you back no matter what you put me through
But now I don't even care no more and the fault belongs to you (you)
Yeah, and the fault belongs to you (you x2)
So what am I supposed to do now
Just forget all of our history
Guess that's the only plan but the reason is a mystery
I'm into you
Cause I know it very well
I guess I was something you were weak enough to sell
I was in a cell, hell, still caught up in your spell
Found the way out now, so I'll grab the mic and fucking yell, hell..
Cause you even laughed that time I fell
Now it's over, cuz I saw inside your shell

''Hello'' (phone)

Outro (Drake):
I’m just sayin’, you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I’m just sayin’ you could do better
And I’ll start hatin’, only if you make me

Phone call (Gillio):
I can't come over? alright
Guess ima just kick it here then uhm
You should stop by if you feel like it, yeah

I hope one day you will realize I did truly care for you
I promise you're gonna miss me being there, putting up with you, refusing to give up on you, you're gonna regret everything
You've done to me including all the damage you've caused and someday
You'll turn back and I won't be waiting for you any longer
I might have been worthless to you but
You'll miss me when I become priceless to another


Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
Oh I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I’ve been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say…

Forget that new guy that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say forget that new guy that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

I’m just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
I'm havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on


I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
Tell me, have you heard that lately?

I'm just sayin' you could do better
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better



[Verse 1]
Cups of the rosé
Women in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
She's happy with a good guy
And I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say

[Chorus]
Fuck that new guy that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that new guy that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge]
I'm just sayin' you could do better
So tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, cups of the XO
All my people been here
And she got all her friends here
She don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
And I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say

[Chorus]
Fuck that new guy that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had

And since you picked up, I know he's not around

So tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 3]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking about women that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Women came over, yeah, we threw a party

Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame

[Verse 1]
I have been up three days
Adderall and redbull
This call is a mistake
There’s something strong in this water bottle
I hear you got a new chick
A dancing little Barbie doll
I feel so pathetic
But you still haven’t heard it all

[Hook]
Fuck that new girl that you like so bad
She’s not crazy like me I bet you like that
I said fuck that new girl that’s been in your bed
And when you’re in her I know I’m in your head
I’m just saying you can do better
Always turned you out every time we were together
Once you had the best you can’t do better
Baby I’m the best so you can’t do better

[Verse 2]
I ran into your homeboys
They’re all fucking idiots
You’re not even my boyfriend
But they're tripping because I’m in the club
Yeah that’s right I’m dancing
And something cool is in my cup
I’ma send a sexy picture
To remind you what you’ve given up


[Hook]
Fuck that new girl that you like so bad
She’s not crazy like me I bet you like that
I said fuck that new girl that’s been in your bed
And when you’re in her I know I’m in your head
I mean, I’m just saying you can do better
Always turned you out every time we were together
Once you had the best boy, you can’t do better
Baby I’m the best so you can’t do better



[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the rosé

[Outro: Drake]
Just throw up while he holds your hair back
Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy"
He hopes no one heard that
He hopes no one heard that
‘Cause if they did, they gonna be in some trouble
They gonna be in some trouble, trouble


[Intro: Davis Absolute]
And nothing's new but the shoes
What it do, what it do
And nothing's new but the shoes
What it do, what it do

[Hook: Timbaland & (Davis Absolute)]
Cash rules everything around me (cake, cake)
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1: Davis Absolute]
Knowledge of the Kingdom for a minute, but I'm so gone
The world wrapped around my throat saying hold on
And I can't breathe, this pain won't leave
Trying get it together on my own the slow [?]
Thoughts so calm
Mastermind of consciousness
Master with a plan or disaster is the consequence
The Benz polished short sight and not confidence
With the faith of a mustard tree, we move continents
Made marvellous, results of a God who thought of us
The same God became a martyr to harbour us
Cold hands in this blood stained promise
The only Man who kept a hundred percent when He promised us
Peace
And a release from the harmfulness
Imagine that heaven only charmed and had come to us
Maybe it's the only thing that belongs to us
Maybe we haven't belonged long enough
Maybe we let sin become a part of us
Maybe we need life water just to wash us up
Not a doubt in my mind that water isn't strong enough
I tried
This evil in my soul is too hard to scrub


[Hook: Timbaland & (Davis Absolute)]
Cash rules everything around me (cake, cake)
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 2: Davis Absolute]
I wouldn't sell my soul for it all
The cash, the gold, the Rolex, the sex
The lust, the pleasure, the million dollar check
I wouldn't sell my soul for it all
Knowledge of the Kingdom but I'm stuck
So hard to move [?] off my hands I was trying to harm this fool
If you thought I'm upset I bond to this carnival
And alarm don't worry my struggles aren't hard to you
Why do I question God's love like it's so hard to prove
Know you only exist cause God thought of you
Now figure that, it's hard to do
Go and try can I promise you it's hard to do
Every mistake that we make it's still starting to
And I'm the one that did it, it's almost like I saw Tucson bleeding ruse
No justice that a song could do
But the moment He looked at me I saw the truth
Some of us just sell amount to put on some jewels
Pharmaceutical dreams of being rich
No one can lose, small pursue
Occupied mind made for larger moves
I'm tryna live, I'mma follow ones for two


[Hook: Timbaland & (Davis Absolute)]
Cash rules everything around me (cake, cake)
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all (cake, cake)

[Verse 3: Joey Jewish]
These snakes always seem to be close to me
It seems that I must treat the ones that mean the most to me
And when this Egyptian touches my chest I'm feeling so outta breath
My conscience won't let me rest
I'm exhausted
Me and Louis V., taking jewellery, [?] move outta and we zoning from the purest keys
Technically a branch, call me palm trees
Simple rose ain't white linen it's south beach
Red carpet up but I keep a hood reach
Hood bleeding so I cleaned it with the good bleach
And every industry rapper we yell preach
They only spit truth right, *beep* please
Man we talk about the cake
Sierra mist with the jelly on the bass
Got a sweet tooth stir it up and then bake
Give you type two, cold body with the shakes
I ain't frontin' B
And you can never have enough of it
[?] or rich, equatorial or obelisk, got a certain lust for this
Talking Grandino
Grant got me blessing, Franklin off the ego
Room so free-o
Chains got me starring out the peep hole
Schizophrenic, but I keep it on the d-low
[?], don't tell them what we know
Money's the route of all evil, amigo
Cake it, cake it


[Verse 4: Joey Jewish]
I got the couple unmuted, I hid in my trunk
Hid in a coffin I'm housing it up
The strippers they throwing it up
God over money, I'm burning it up
Every young rapper we change in the game
Dorian Grey, you'll be hearing my name
Lion-hearts everywhere no we ain't lame (lion-heart)
Church and now I'm shaking my mane
Spirit domain
Glory to God in the highest, giving Him all of the praise
Prolly ain't nothing but plates
I wouldn't be massin' the route with Jesus' name
[?] no matter how much you all make
No celebration like who ate the cake
Winners so said it so what you do with Jesus Christ the only thing that will remain
What they saying, cake, cake, cake
They said they cake, they said they cake, they said they cake
Cake, cake, cake
I heard 'em say cake
They say the cake
They say the cake
They worry 'bout that cake
They focused on that cake
Oh oh
I ain't worry 'bout that
I tell them I
Burn it up
Tell 'em that I burn it up
Take that money and I burn it up
Money and I burn it up
Take that money and I burn it up
You know I do burn it up



[Drake]
I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
She could be good for me yeahh
That's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's starin' in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh

[Hook]
I hate getting, messages from you, from you
It's like you know the perfect shit to say
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
I hate getting messages from you, from you
Especially when you say you should've stayed
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh

[Bridge]
Ooh, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
But I still text you back, say I miss you too

Drake:
I love milkin



[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus 2: Drake & Beyoncé]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

[Verse 3: Drake]
From eight until late, I think ‘bout you
You own my nights, I don’t know what to do, do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus 2: Drake & Beyoncé]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup...

[Verse 4: Drake]
(Pull up on you) I gotta pull up on you
You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don’t go ghost on me, I'ma go Thriller on you, I'ma just (Pull up on you)

'Cause they don’t wanna see you happier than them
And girl you swear they all ya friends and that's been a problem (Pull up on you)
You the one they hate, just come with that

But that nigga came running back

And I believe it's true
As long as you know who you belong to

[Outro: Beyoncé]
All I’m really asking for is you
Long as you know who you belong to

[Intro]
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Drake]
Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars, I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would've cared more
That's my only feeling inside whenever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
'Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a missus

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out? Do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'Cause I can't get you outta my mind

[Bridge]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't

[Hook]
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Missin' everything you say
Missin' all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away?
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby '07 supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
'Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind

[Bridge]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't

[Hook]
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop

[Outro]
I can't stop, missing you
I can't stop, missing you
(I don't wanna stop) I can't stop missing you
(Baby) I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop, missin' you




[Verse 1: Drake & Bun B]
I said, "Tell me what's really goin' on"
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said "If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em"
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah

Hire some help (Help), get rid of these niggas (Skrr)

I'm your brother shit, all that other shit

My bitch in Chanel now
Your bitch in Escada (Sick, sick, sick, sick)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and they shook
Please don't let them fool ya, I don't care how they look (Nah)
Heard all of the talkin', now it's quiet, now it's shush (Shh)
Twenty-nine is comin', they on edge when I cook (Cook)
Lead the league in scorin', man, but look at my assists (Shh)
Yes I be with Future but I like to reminisce (Yeah)
I do not forget a thing, I'm patient, it's a gift (yeah)
Try to tell 'em they ain't got to do it, they insist (they insist)
Yeah, I can tell
I just gave 'em two for forty million like Chappelle (Two)
Standin' over coffin with a hammer and a nail (Two)
Heard you hit up so and so, that name don't ring a bell, nah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sick of these niggas (Sick)
Hire some help, get rid of these niggas

I'm runnin' a blitz (Ayy)
Whatever you did (Ayy), it is what it is


[Chorus]

Knock you off to pay their tithes (Do doo)
They want me gone but don't know why

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment, I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of (Yeah)
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

[Verse 2: Drake]
What I tell them hoes? Bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to your knees
Young Money the mafia, that's word to Lil' Cease
I'm in the Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz
Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez
Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

[Bridge: Nick Minaj]
This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive




[Intro - Birdman]
Make it so fresh: YM
So fly, so priceless, CMB bitch
Just another day on the
Top floor of the balcony bitch
Live it how we live it
Mula, Drizzy
You what it is, young'un: appreciate that
It's big money popping baby boy
Ain't none of that lil biddy

[Hook]
More, m-more milly
More, m-more milly

[Verse 1 - Birdman]
Pearl-white candy paint job fly
Big Tymer on the loose
Got a bitch riding 5
And every time I pull up, you know I'm iced up
When I step up in the club I light the bitch up
Back on my saddle throwing purple out the truck
Candy paint, rally stripe, shining like us
Pearly white Maybach hatchback
Automatic straps, stash spots under the rack
Bitch, ready to spray that
Foreign grinds, hard times
Getting mines, you know: Uptown
Big time doing time
You know, Harley Davis baby
Cash money is who pay me so you pay me how it weigh, baby
Black gold, 100 mil off the floor
Never told now you know how it go bitch
One hundred, one hundred

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Drake]
You're now fucking with the most requested
The young nigga that everybody is so obsessed with
And black-on-black 62 float majestic
Me and Stunna in it, boy: I'm just so connected
Caught up in a popularity contest
I'm about to reach my dreams and I ain't even got my arms stretched
Thank Me Later: first week, I'm taking all bets
Because a million copies isn't really far-fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on til the flash stops
It's for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shorty, go ahead, bust it open
I keep a secret, baby: nothing's heard when nothing's spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Are all that fuels the conversations between y'all
And dogg that's funny; pay me what you owe me nigga
All cash money

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Bun B]
Well it's that big body nigga and his big body car
Got a big body boppa with that million dollar jaw
She said: "daddy I like sushi, so give it to me raw!"
I pulled out my strap condom, looked down there and said "naw"
Cigar full of Kush you need prescriptions to access
Laying on the mattress with your favorite actress
My blunt was going out, I said "baby, pass the matches"
And let her top me off while I'm tapping off the ashes
Classic, but classless
You gassed up, but gasless
Unleaded, yeah. Bun said it, nigga get past it
Taking what you got, you should've passed it
You was moving slower that molasses
This time you were nasty
Give it up to him; it's a jack
Don't move! This is murder music, nigga
Don't disturb this room. 2 trill Ent Cash Money and October's Own
We true playas down to the last chromosome


[Hook]
I take time to make that (Money)
Some breakdowns get caked back (Money)
Flip eight times, get eight stacks (Money)
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's no need to stash right (Money)
Same four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me

[Verse 1]
Hey yo I'm movin' on up, excuse a moi, pardon it's me
There's a new chapter to life that I'm starting to see
And I'ma make and spend money to the hardest degree
And on the low I probably mimic every artist I see
I need a house, a wifey, a nice watch and a lot of cake
I can't lie, there's certain figures I gotta make
And for my family, this a shot that I gotta take
Cause where I live there's nobody as hot as Drake
Which basically means, who's faith in his team
Will resort to new cars, briefcases with cream
Tryna find a space in the jeans for placing the green
And a watch get they attention, the bracelet's clean
I'm stayin' the music, wifey kinda need to be a band lover
I keep it flow, an old school like your grandmother
I'm a tan brother, they use rubber bands to keep his money intact, if you don't like it you should ban rubber


[Hook]
I take time to make that (Money)
Some breakdowns get caked back (Money)
Flip eight times, get eight stacks (Money)
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's no need to stash right (Money)
Same four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me

[Verse 2]
These days I really can't break 20s, hunnid and make money, money
Every month, the government will take money from me
Make 750, look how quicky I spent that, don't call me broke cause I strictly  resent that
Last my P had to flip my the rent, because the tax bracket I'm in's is 50 percent flat
All because of Ebay givin' me leway, basically do the PayPal, I need a raise now
Seems every time a nigga stop and he eat, I end up always tryna shop and compete
They know a nigga 'bout it when it's in his size and cops it in more colors than Popsicle Pete
Till I'm piled to the top with receipts, trust the store and I don't understand less is more
Wanna get 'em to the point where they owe me, and they gon' see Drake's on his JOB, it's like...

[Hook]
I take time to make that (Money)
Some breakdowns get caked back (Money)
Flip eight times, get eight stacks (Money)
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right
There's no need to stash right
Same four G's from last night
You cannot take that from me

Locked up 'cause a nigga didn't tell
Real niggas never took the deal like Chappelle
Warden tripping 'cause I treat the jail like a hotel
My celly tripping 'cause I got a cellie in my cell (cellie)
Ringing like a telethon

First single got me banned from America
I need to call up Farrakhan
When they let me through I swear it's on (ya, ya)

[Pre-Hook]

Never turn my back I ain't with all of that
I go do a hit and then start walking back (bow, bow)
Don't live far away from where I dropped him at
But I got a zipper where my 9 goes
My lawyer and the judge are playing 9 holes (woo, woo)
Got some new chains just to stun you haters
Bakaveli, I want all the paper (woo, woo)

[Pre-Hook]

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

[Verse 2: Drake]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it


Chorus:
Home grown, Out of hate
That's why I won’t take my time
Treat it all like a race
Not your average, not the type to land in the cage
Cause there's not enough evidence to even build a case
No trace
It don't matter what risk I gotta take
And if I ever want to go there, I just go and board a plane
I just store it at her place, that’s a $1,000 safe
In the basement and i'm almost out of space, I need a new location

Verse:
Sounds like i'm back, on Soundcloud there's no tracks
Rapping like a couple exes stabbed me in the back
A year ago, I was broke, I don't plan on going back
I got all the OG's mad cause all the levels I surpassed
I just really need it bad, bitch I'm hungry I don't fast
Only difference between us is I don’t let a second pass
Yuh, in my city i’ve been known to wear a couple hats
Been counting money in my past life, and way before that
Got it on my own I never prayed to God
Fake friends the only thing I've ever lost
Even when it got tough, never thought to stop
Do it all again I’d grow up on the same block
With the same charges, yeah fleeing from the same cops
Same houses getting hit, no one ever getting caught
Interrogating mutes all day, no ones going to talk
Insufficient probable, everybody going to walk
We got different views, I just never look down
Way too deep, never have to look out
All I gotta ask who's bitch we took now?
Yeah I saw his ass in public and he looking shook down
They gon run they mouth till you respond with some rounds
No you never dealt with hounds, that's been locked up in the pound
Yeah I turned the volume down on the gun there's no sound
There’s a lot of bodies F.B.I haven't found, yeah


Chorus:
Home grown, Out of hate
That's why I won't take my time
Treat it all like a race
Not your average, not the type to land in the cage
Cause there's not enough evidence to even build a case
No trace
It don't matter what risk I gotta take
And if I ever want to go there, I just go and board a plane
I just store it at her place, that's a $1,000 safe
In the basement and i'm almost out of space, I need a new location

[Drake talking]
Southern Smoke
It's Southern Smoke baby!
(Money) Frank Dukes
(Money) My man Nickelus F
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke

[Verse 1: Drake]
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!

[Hook]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me, homie

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
Money’s the reason my best friend got murdered
So with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it
Milk the game, turn it to butter, look how I turned it
No chick shall get any of dis unless she earns it
Take that dick, put to your lips and insert it
Where the hell is self-respect go when them checks show?
You sleep with them anywhere, hell is your bed for?
You always on your back, what the hell is your legs for?
I know, walk that strip, get my grip
That new Benz’s comin out, put some 'umph' in your switch, trick
Plus I need rims, diamonds and gems
So get up, do the hand job, and some head for him
I got my mind on my money, and my money on your mind
I’ll blow your mind all over the money that’s on your mind
So keep my dough off your head, fuck with do on your head
Now you really got money on your mind, nigga!

[Hook]

More Life.
 
More time with family and friends. More Life.
 
I've still got vibrations to send. More Life.
 
They say that we could live forever
 
At night I pray it's true
 
I've done so much in my short time and still there's more to do
 
But if someone should come collecting

Sooner than we're all expecting
 
At least the life you lived was one for you

— Drake


[Intro: Birdman]
Make it so fresh, YM
So fly so priceless, CMB bitch
Just another day on the
Top floor of the balcony bitch
Live it how we live it
Mula, Drizzy

Ain't none of that lil biddy
More, mo more milli
More, mo more milli
Yeah...

[Verse 1: Birdman]
It's pearl white candy paint job fly
Big timer on the loose
Got a bitch riding five
And everytime I pull up you know I'm iced up
When I step up in the club I light the bitch up
Back on my saddle throwing purple out the truck
Candy paint rally stripe shining like us
Pearly white maybach, hatchback automatic
Straps stash spots under the rack
Bitch, ready to spray that
Foreign grinds hard times
Getting mines, you know uptown
Big time doing time
You know, Harley Davis baby
Cash money is pay me so you pay me how it weigh
Baby, black, gold
100 mill off the floor
Never told now you know how it go bitch
One hundred, one hundred


[Verse 2: Drake]
Lord!
You're now fucking with the most requested
The young nigga that everybody is so obsessed with
And black on black 62 float majestic
Me and Stunna in it, boy I'm just so connected
Caught up in a popularity contest
It's about to reach my dreams and I ain't even got my arms stretched
Thank Me Later first week I'm taking all bets
Because a million copies isn't really far fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on until the flash stops
It's for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shawty, go ahead buss it open
I keep a secret baby, nothing's heard when nothing's spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Have confused all the conversations between y'all
And dog that's funny, pay me what owe me nigga
All cash money

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Yeah!
Boy it's that big body nigga in his big-bodied car
Got a big body boppa with that million-dollar drawer
She said "Daddy I like sushi", so baby take me raw
I pulled out my strapped condom, looked down said "naw!"
Cigar full of kush, you need prescriptions to access
Laying on a mattress, with your favourite actress
My flow is going out, I said baby pass the matches
And let her top me off while I'm tapping off the ashes
Classy but classless, you danced off the guest-list
A lady here but said it, nigga get past it
Take it what you've got, you should've passed it
You was moving slower than molasses, it's time you were nasty
Give it up too, it's a jack, don't move
This is murder music, nigga don't disturb this groove
Too trill with the team, Cash Money ?
We true players down to the last chromosome

You can not move in with me if Trump wins
I'm sorry, that's no go
I really am glad to be here but you'll ha...you'll have to excuse me if I seem a little upset
Backstage, right before I came out
My friend showed me this...meme he found online
And it just...it really shook me
It was a picture of me dancing in my Hotline Bling video
And some joker...had put a caption on it that said
"When you farted and got away with it"
And if I'm being real, like...it hurts, you know...and it...
It just seems like this keeps happening to me
And I don't know...It's almost like I can do is sing about it
So...I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Drinks with some old friends
That's when it happens again
I start hearing from the whole fam
That I got clowned on Instagram
Tryna hide my reaction
When I read the funny caption
Feels like I'm in a bad dream
Cause I got turned into another meme, yeah

[Hook 1]
I just wanna scream
That I'm more than a meme, that's right
I just wanna scream
That I'm more than a meme

[Verse 2]
Catch me looking with those bedroom eyes
Asking if you're gonna finish those fries
Tryna say you really care about me
But then you put my picture on E.T (It's not nice)
How can I explain to my momma
When you got my beard on Obama
I do not complain, I am not a whiner
But why am I sitting on the Seinfeld diner?

[Hook 2]
I feel like I'm swimming upstream
Against all of these memes
Why do they attack me?
And then attack my favorite team?

[Verse 3]
Look, I'm not just a picture, I have feelings too
Like, how would you feel if it happened to you?
If I came after you, did a meme of her
Yeah cause your sketch got cut after dress rehearsal (eighty)
What if I found your moment of pain
And used it for my own comedy gain?

[Shortened Hook]
Now you know what I mean
That I'm more than a meme

[Verse 4]
And look, I get that my face is expressive
But some of the memes are a little aggressive
I would just say it's a little excessive
When you go make me the face of Progressive
I know it's not important
But when they catch my face contorted
And the meaning gets distorted
I can only help but feel like crying Jordan
I'm more than a meme

[Interlude: Drake + Drake as Rihanna]
Oh, ladies and gentleman, do I have a treat for you tonight
Rihanna is here tonight, make some noise
Oh I'm so excited to be here tonight
Oh my God, oh my God

[Beat-Switch]

[Bridge]
Yeah, see Drake ain't a meme, meme, meme, meme, meme
But it nah seem, seem, seem, seem, seem, seem
Another joker getting, getting, getting, getting, getting
I swear we only friend, friend, friend, friend, friends...
Alright, Rihanna's incredible ladies and gentleman
Make some noise for her please

[Beat-Switch]

[Outro]
I should take it as a sign of self-esteem
It feels like I'm the victim of an internet scheme
It's just hard when it seems
You don't love me for me
You just love me for memes

Because you never even know the half what it's worth to me i do it for the love I'm not rapping to work for free
And everywhere its taken me at i deserve to be

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
There's way more people that want it
Than people that have it
I don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked ‘em
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
Yeah, I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
It goes up and down, it’s just up and down
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong..

[Verse 2: Mary J Blige]
Bad boys ain't no good
Good boys ain't no fun
Lord knows that I should
Run off with the right one

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (So good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (So bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Verse 3: Mary J Blige]
Hung up off your good
You call and I run
My fam' is screaming at me don’t do it
"Don't do it, Mary!"
I guess they never had none

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (So good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (So bad)
We got a special thing going on (Going on)
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Bridge: Mary J Blige]
When he put that loving on me, I can’t think of nothing
That’ll make me walk out
I’m holding on
I love my Mr. Wrong
He be kissing and touching on me
I can’t help but love him
I must be out my mind
For going so strong
I love my Mr. Wrong
Mr. Wrong

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (So good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (So bad)
We got a special thing going on(Going on)
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could (I never could)
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Mr. Wrong


They tellin' lies on Hot 97, that's how it goes
I told 'em fire Funk Flex, then I'll come and do your show
Plus me and Kanye, we just left out of the studio
My first night in the Garden, I'm feelin' like D. Rose

[Produced by Neenyo]

[Intro]
I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when "fuck bitches, get money" was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single


[Hook]
If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm whats wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker(so)
I'm in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 (say what)
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the grain and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice

[Hook]


[Verse 3: Drake]
Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica
I say 'baby get low', You just getting by
They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply

[Hook]

[Intro: Drake & Popcaan]
Go outside

Jealous people around me, I need to change my life

[Chorus: Drake]

Word, matter of fact beautiful ain't the word
Unexplainable is the beauty of her
And I will be the race car hitting her curves
Errrrr

Yeah and then I park it
She got a smile on her that put a smile on me
She cater to me she get all destiny child on me
She ride for me even though I got miles on me
She gon ride till the day they put flowers on me
Thats my darling
And I love it, yeh

So sweet she bad for me
But she so good I'll take the cavity
Falling for her like how safe is gravity
I'll make your girl about face and marry me
Hahahaha, yeh
I do, do you


[Drake]
But ahhh, the things I'm willing to do to her
I wish I could have a threesome with two of her
I would sing a love song if I knew the words
But I'll be damned if another nigga do it first
Cos you the one, damn I think I see the sun
I guess that mean you gotta run
Well holla at me when you done

[Hook]
Can I dig it
When you baby
Woop woop woop
My darling baby

[Drake]
Uhh
She nothing like every other dime
I think about her and couple things come to mind
Thoughts like if she end up my baby mother fine
Cos we only use a rubber like every other time
Oooh, I bet she so embarrassed
I had to take her ass to Paris
Give her the moments that she cherish
You know


[Lil Wayne]
Yep
She got it coming to her like an heiress
And anything she want I Will like Farris
Oops I meant ferris and in the coupe I tint very light
So them hating bitches can see me and you at every light
Oooh, and I hope its one of them long lights
I mean I hope its one of them long nights
No wrong turns, ain't no such things as a wrong right

[Drake]
Uh yeah
You make me feel so good
And every time we cut I swear it heals so good
Its been over a year that shit is still so good
No adjusting for you, you know just what to do and all
Yea, oh and I love it
See I'm trying to make it public
I think the glass slipper does fit

[Lil Wayne]
And yesterday I told her she a muthafucker
And how her new haircut is so becoming of her
Oh thats your girl, well I'mma make a women of her
Never do to another what we do one another
Now thats a numbers for ya, and i'll give up my summers for ya
Yeah I'll spend my winters and my springs on it
And put a ring on it, eyy


[Hook]

[Drake]
Uhh, just say yes not no
The club is overrated baby lets not go
Lets stay home and burn a couple calories
Fuck the house up and make the maid earn a salary
Yeah I cook you dinner if you cook me breakfast
They say that nobodies perfect but you look perfected
I really love to be the one you took a step with
So trust me when I tell you it'd be worth the effort

[Lil Wayne]
Shes unbelievable like a purple leopard
Just give me the formula watch me work the method
Hehe, Weezy F, I prefer the best shit
And babe you the fucking best
You deserve a trophy
You could be my four leaf clover
Her clothes aren't tight nigga their cosy
And when she turn around they say Whoa like Joey
Thats my baby
And I love it
Yeah, Young Money

[Verse 1: Majid Al Maskati]
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
I meant every word that I said
You should have spent more time listening
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a "hold on"
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long

[Chorus: Majid Al Maskati]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love

Why you want to, why you want to
Why you want to, why you want to

[Verse 2: Drake]
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
Even when you sleep in my bed
I know you're not mine officially
And all the things I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a "hold on"
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long


[Chorus: Majid Al Maskati]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love

[Bridge: Drake]
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off and shine 'em up, and line 'em up, oh
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me, or line me up, no
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off and shine 'em up, and line 'em up, oh
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no

[Chorus: Majid Al Maskati]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love


[Outro: Majid Al Maskati]
Why you want to, why you want to
Why you want to, why you want to
Why do you wanna be my love?
Why do you wanna be

[Verse 1]
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
I meant every word that I said
You should have spent more time listening
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a, "Hold on"
What makes you so ready right now?
After I waited on you for so long

[Chorus]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?

Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?

[Verse 2]
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
Even when you sleep in my bed
I know you're not mine officially
And all the things I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a, "Hold on"
What makes you so ready right now?
After I waited on you for so long


[Chorus]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?

[Bridge]
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off
And shine 'em up, and line 'em up, oh
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off
And shine 'em up, and line 'em up, oh
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no

[Chorus]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?


[Outro]

Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?



* bonus song off of Comeback Season

[Verse One] [Drake]
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though
I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby

[Hook]
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse Two] [Drake]
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like �I ain't getting service in your area�
You be like �Nigga get your bars up�
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby! (look)

[Hook]
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around


[Intro]
I thought you were my only
Girl why'd you have to go away
Girl why'd you have to go away
Yeah I thought you were my only
Yeah I thought you were my only

[Chorus]
Girl why'd you have to go away
We could have kept it on the low key
And I know you so lonely
But no you can't control me
You're starting to take a toll on me
And I thought you were my only
Yeah I thought you were my only
Yeah I thought you were my only

[Verse]
We kept it on the low key
Now you acting like you don't even know me
But you used to be so close to me
This ain't the way it's supposed to be
No this ain't the way it's supposed to be
I went to try to patch it up
I need you I can't pass you up
But something just ain't adding up
And time is moving fast as fuck
Yeah time is moving fast as hell
If you leave me then I wish you well
Are you leaving me? Cause I can't tell
I swept you up I fell for you
Just wanted you to come be my boo
Just wanted it to be me and you
I just wanted it to be me and you


[Chorus]
Girl why'd you have to go away
We could have kept it on the low key
And I know you so lonely
But no you can't control me
You're starting to take a toll on me
And I thought you were my only
Yeah I thought you were my only
Yeah I thought you were my only

[Verse]
Take a little hit of this let the beat dap
Shotgunning through her kiss
Swear that she bad
Swear that she perfect
The way she work it
Running through my head it make my mind go mad
Now you're turning off the heat that we once had
Never thought that I would let it get this bad
Stuck me with the pain that I've already passed
Tried to work it out but I fell right on my ass
I just don't understand girl
Gave you my all, would have given up my whole world
You were my home girl
But it drove you so crazy I guess it was chauffeured
Look how this unfurled
We're yelling and screaming
About shit with no meaning
You love me you hate me
You change like the seasons
The stunts that you pull are just too damn deceiving
Say


[Chorus]
Girl why'd you have to go away
We could have kept it on the low key
And I know you so lonely
But no you can't control me
You're starting to take a toll on me
And I thought you were my only
Yeah I thought you were my only
Yeah I thought you were my only

Always tryna' take a pic like

Gotta get all A's
Until I get the degree

My plan
My plan
Is to hide and not get whopped

[Intro]
Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like, fo real
This life shit is everywhere, you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take you down through there
Make me wanna take you down through there
I'll take it there

[Chorus 1]
Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things
That don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man


[Verse]
Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
'Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

[Chorus 2]
And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man

Take you where you want to go, flexing on your ex, I know

How dare that nigga run his mouth when his pockets in a drought
The last single he put out didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy

[Intro: Drake]
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do

[Verse 1: Oliver Sim + Drake]
I turned a blind eye
Let the borders get wavy
Nothing touches me lately
Shouldn't I be having fun?
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do
It's hard to define
When my memory's hazy
Everyone's trying to save me
Can't they see I'm having fun?
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do

[Chorus: Oliver Sim + Romy Madley Croft]
Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
Can't tell no one what it means to me
Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
And the longer that I leave it, I can feel it taking over me


[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft]
Shy away and hide out
When it's calling me out
When it's weighing me down
I'll play it down
When all the trouble I've found
Comes back around
If it's catching me now
That's the wrong thing
I'll play it down
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do[Chorus: Romy]
Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
Can't tell no one what it means to me
Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
And the longer that I leave it, I can feel it taking over me[Oliver]
Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive



Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive[Drake]






That's the wrong thing[Outro: Romy]
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
I play it down[Drake]
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing[Romy]
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
I play it down[Oliver]
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
I play it down
Can't they see[Drake]




That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing



[Intro]
Previously on Ready To Die

[Chorus]
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta 42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Never had a lot, this is all I need

[Verse 1]
Lost individuals is all I see
Grab the top spot like pardon my reach
Woke up one day and it was all on me
If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me
Lotta 42 on the flights I'm takin'
Long way down from the heights I'm chasin'
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas
Girls checkin' in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turnin' off my phone for the night now, baby
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Some of my niggas don't love me
We should sit down before shit turns ugly
We should sit down since you said things about me

[Chorus]
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta 42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

[Verse 2]
You should slide through and get your back broke
Used to be involved with me with no emotion
I was on the way to the next show
You was on the phone and you were so open
Heard you said you're over me, is that so?
You don't ever filter girl and that's okay
Coulda held on but you let it go
Sayin' to yourself that it's better this way
Funny thing is that you're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke
Funny thing is that you're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke
Feelings I've been stackin' like a bankroll
I should probably find a way to let it go
Wonder what it was that turned you this cold
Said you left me jaded and I wasn't joking
Miss the way it was a couple years ago
Back when we was young and now you've outgrown me
Hard to just accept I was a steppin' stone
Way that people talk about you I should've known
You're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke
Funny thing is that you're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke




Intro




[Intro: Drake & Lil Juice]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Ayy, yeah
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
Yeah, ayy, look

[Verse 1: Drake & Gunna]
I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, "Fuck it", I'm goin' on the run
You want it, my dawgs'll look out for the bond

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Boy, at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me "No" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

[Outro: Drake, Lil Juice & Gunna]
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
You seen the overseas drip?




[Intro: Future]
​No matter what you do, it's never enough
​I don’t understand these bitches, Drizzy
​Trying though, they ain't never satisfied
EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
​
​[Chorus: Drake]
​Time after time after time
​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
​But I ain't never satisfied
Yeah, I ain't never satisfied
​I found the one and say, "I'll never cheat again"
​We don’t talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied, I ain't never satisfied

[Bridge: Drake]
I'm putting pressure on these niggas and I know
But I still be on the road like I'm scared of going broke
Cause I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied

[Verse: Future]
And it's a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rosé with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop
They ain't never satisfied

​[Chorus: Drake]
​Time after time after time
​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
​But I ain't never satisfied
Yeah, I ain't never satisfied
​I found the one and say, "I'll never cheat again"
​We don’t talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied, I ain't never satisfied




[Intro: Future]
​No matter what you do, it's never enough

EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
They ain't never satisfied
​
​[Chorus: Drake & Future]
​Time after time after time (Ayy)
​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
And they ain't never satisfied (Yeah)

And you can make it rain until your arms tired (Yeah)
As soon as it all stop them bitches just wonder why (Yeah)
They ain't never satisfied
They ain't never satisfied (Oh no, oh no)
And they ain't ever

[Bridge: Drake & Future]
Ain't no pressure on the money, Lord knows
But we still be on the road like we scared of going broke
We ain't never satisfied (No, no, never)
We ain't never (Never), we ain't never (No, no, never)

[Verse 1: Future]
And it's a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rosé with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew

We ain't never satisfied (No, no, never)
We ain't never (Never), we ain't never (No, no, never)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah
There's a lot of money in the room
She said she wanna ball, wanna shoot some hoop
I put up big numbers for a new recruit
We just out here doing what young niggas do
Me and that boy Future could probably start a group
On some K-Ci and JoJo shit, have these bitches loose
Man, they know what it do
We got these niggas in the game stuck and they shouldn't move
I don't like sudden moves
Tell me, how is it that every fuckin' verse get the rewind?
And the watch cost too much for free time
And I hit the strip club, that's my me time
See I can't get much bigger, I'm that nigga
But they ain't never satisfied

​[Chorus: Drake & Future]
​Time after time after time (Ayy)
​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
And they ain't never satisfied (Yeah)
And we ain't ever satisfied (Ayy, they ain't ever satisfied)
And you can make it rain until your arms tired (Yeah)
As soon as it all stop them bitches just wonder why (Yeah)
They ain't never satisfied
They ain't never satisfied (Oh no, oh no)
And they ain't ever

[Bridge: Drake & Future]
Ain't no pressure on the money, Lord knows
But we still be on the road like we scared of going broke
We ain't never satisfied (No, no, never)
We ain't never (Never), we ain't never (No, no, never)

[Outro: Drake & Future]
Yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah


Drake has confirmed the title of his upcoming fourth studio album, Views From the 6, though he won't begin work on it until after he returns from his 31-city co-headlining tour with Lil Wayne. The tour, slated to start after the Canadian rapper's OVO Fest, will kick off August 8th in Darien Center, New York and run through September 27th, when it ends in Woodlands, Texas. That tour, which is sponsored by a video-game manufacturer, will feature a nightly competition between fans of the two rappers.


The meaning of the album title is unclear, but the announcement is just one part of what will be a busy summer for the rapper. On July 16th, Drake will host ESPN's ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, where the ceremony will be televised live at 9 p.m. EST on the sports channel. The show intends to celebrate the best moments in sports with music, comedy bits and appearances by famous athletes.

Later in the month, Drake's label OVO Sound will release two records by artists he signed. Majid Jordan will put out A Place Like This on July 22nd, and PARTYNEXTDOOR will release PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO on the 29th. Drake recently made a guest appearance on the latter artist's "Recognize," streaming below via Rap-Up, which will appear on the album.

Drake will then stage OVO Fest in Toronto on August 3rd and 4th, when Outkast will perform and he will do his own set, with appearances by yet-to-be-confirmed special guests. This year, OVO Fest was awarded a CAN $300,000 government grant, which amounts to roughly US $268,000, as part of an initiative to help out festivals in Ontario. A press release claims the festival has sold out of the fest's 35,000 tickets.

CHAPTERS
ANOTHER BANGER

[Chorus]
We gonna take it back
It's too authentical
He gonna pull the punches like nautyca
Everywhere he goes he's got a naughty one
He wanna dine with me
I just slack with him.                            (2X)

[HOOK]
I don't fuck with you
You just a baby boo

Super clean hunter
Shawty wannna ma iguana

YEAH!!!!!
I'm quarantine cleaned so relaxed
Got ma pillows in ma Benz maybach
Choose a hoe I got hoes by the batch
I let her roll quickly got her attached
Hit the street and tear this bitch like Willie B


[VERSE]
There's blood all on ma timberland
I swear to God she's feeling it
You keep that ace for more minutes
She know we gotta get in it
I smell ma hands it's killin'
Ma dick rose up to 9 inches
I skate off bye ma darling bae
Seems like ma nigga passing back
To tell her things I never said
I've always wanted to get some hoes
To explain why they snitch on me
Like 69 did to cardi b
MENDO SWECK!!!!!!!!!!!
U gotta put the bitches in the gamble
Thug bad buh gotta be humble
To lay low I'm just gonna mumble

[Chorus]
We gonna take it back
It's too authentical
He gonna pull the punches like nautyca
Everywhere he goes he's got a naughty one
He wanna dine with me
I just slack with him.                                   (2X)


[HOOK]
I don't fuck with you

Super clean hunter
Shawty wannna ma iguana

I bought ma dog a black back.....



[Verse 1: Drake]
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
I write so, I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ISO
What is about to unfold, no tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though, I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw, that is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby

[Hook]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse 2: Von Pea]
It's been a couple weeks out travelin' and this broad
I've seen a couple freaks out battlin' for discharge it's odd
I try to tell her I ain't seen a flier one
Denying some, I have desired some, but that time is done
Now I am gon' give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, I've embraced one in lace, she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I mean literal
Her girl made it figurative, or maybe that's what liquor do
Baby, that's the physical, maybe if we spend
A few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin' hittin' on the road is the typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin' through
Your pictures, this bruh took a good game
But a fella couldn't Roc, I wanna Dash to my Dame
I'm sayin', I know I be playin' too much
But I'd rather go deaf than loose touch, holla at me

[Hook]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Round, round, round, round, round
Ayo, the same chick from "Don't you have a man?" "Well..."
It all blowed over like Manuel Noriega
She said she wouldn't marry the player
But she's the Tamia to his Grant Hill, man chill
I thought you was my damn seal
In distress, rescue you from the landfill
She said, "That ain't enough protection
I need +Affection+ like Lisa Stansfield
I guess I can't be mad at this thing that you got
I'll lace you up but I ain't tryin' to tie the knot, so ah
From me you won't hear no more questions
And please understand that you got my blessings
I hope that your new love opens doors
And is everything that you hopin' for
But you can't get my new shit, girl you spoken for

[Hook]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse 4: Drake]
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like "I ain't getting service in your area"
You be like "Nigga get your bars up"
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong, I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch, holla at me baby! (look)

[Hook]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First-last, phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles

Without a follow, without a mention
You really pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta be nice for what to these niggas?

[Verse 2: Drake]
I understand, you got a hunnid bands
You got a baby Benz, you got some bad friends
High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressin' off no lover in the past tense
You already had them
Work at 8 A.M., finish 'round five
Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same offline
You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (Alright!)
It's a short life


[Bridge: Big Freedia & Letitia Wright]
Uh-huh! (Oh yeah!)
These hoes! (They mad!)
Your boy! (I had!)
I made! (Watch the breakdown)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

[Breakdown: Drake]
Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta, gotta, gotta g-g-gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta
Gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta, gotta make that jump, jump (Let's go)

[Dani] (No Scrubs)
A scrub is a guy thinks thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin' 'bout what he wants
And just sits and waits around, so

[Katherine] (Friends)
So don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with
I'm done being polite
I told you 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 thousand times

[Amy] (No Scrubs)
'Cause, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy who can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy who can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holler at me

[Lauren] (Nice For What)
(Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me

Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?)
Everybody get this goin' on

Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose now in so long

Working hard, yeah, everything paid for
First, last phone bill, car note, cable

You're not my lover, more like a brother
Known you since we were like 10

[Verse 1 - Diggy Simmons]
Girls over there and they talking about
Their FUN, let's get in: Range Rover's
What I'm trying to "F" you in
Talk is cheap, lies is sin
Let Just Do It: Nike shit
Fairy tale, little red, ride me like
I'm in the hood. Rollin on that tree, we good
Can you roll it? I wish you would..
Have these niggas run their mouth like engines, so
They wish they could. Need to get your mind right
Pussy run your intuitions, bitches only here
To fill the gaps, then them chicks is missing
Them chicks is different - then them chicks be kissing!
Other chicks on the lips - man, that shit's exquisite
My place is official, we party all the time
And you should come through with your friend and sip
Bacardi Lime. We don't fuck with them girls who
Think they're hard to find. They want
Attention all the time, but we hardly find
I'm laid back: that's a hard recline
Your girl cheating, and she's about to go down..

It's about to come down..

[Hook]
I got the kush rolled up, Henny in the cup
And that's all I need tonight
Do this shit every night
And we gonna do this shit every night
And we don't give a fuck about haters..

Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone
I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

Come right in
Set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fitting for what I'm about to do

No you ain't explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet I'll be fine without your help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do wit it
I know what to do wit it
I know what to do wit it
I know what to do wit it
Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh

Yeah
I've been waiting for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So baby imma lock my door and disconnect my phone
Cuz I wanna make one thing clear

I want you on top
So let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl I'm gonna
Turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fitting for what we're about to do

Come right in
Set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fitting for what I'm about to do

No you ain't explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet I'll be fine without your help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do wit it

[Intro]
M-M-Murda

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, fake
Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for the snakes, yeah

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop "Another One", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
"Back to Back"? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah
Left the operating table, still look like "nah"

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, never been no fraud
Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, "What up, Killa?"
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I am not a fraud, YM, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, "Alright, alright, alright"
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, "Babe, I think I love you, kinda"
Feelin' like Tune-y Montana, Weezy, he get honored
Drake a headliner, and Nicki, she get finer, word


i dont need no, frauds
i dont need no drama when you call
i dont need no, i dont need no, lies
yeah

pick a side, pick a side

i took the prize
lift that bitch up
i took the ice
let me lift my wrist up
i took the prize
and lift that bitch up
i took the ice,
let me lift my wrist up

ayo throw your wrist-es up
all my bitches up
these dudes is --- than what
all them --- is up
all my real down to ride, throw your GSXRS up
i aint in the projects, but all them bricks is up
you cant be pablo if your work aint sellin' oh
what the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
i woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
i am the genereous queen, ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop "Another One", you itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter,
now you wish it was scrapped
heard your -- on yuck, guess you needed a pap
what type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
what type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
lil boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
"back to back"? me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but
when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album


Oh my god
I changed it
oh my god
they on the same shit
oh my god
I changed it
oh my  god
they still on the same shit

you can't say nothin'
you can't say nothin'
you end up everywhere you say that you wasn't
is that your boyfriend? why you say thats your cousin?
i dont do handshakes, that shits disgusts me


Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some
with you
with you
now i gotta erase some
with you
oh with you


i dont need no, i dont need no,
i dont need no frauds
no drama when you call
no (face?)
yeah yeah



[Verse 1: fritzy ]
You say my life's abnormal then you better watch
Asking me to be normal man you ain't my coach
I ain't standing here for you to get pleasure to watch
Before i forget i also got laundries to wash
Shit, this life ain't worth a price
It's like a game sit down we roll the dice
I'm just grinding to get paper for us
While you're sitting there saying that am so nice
Huh' don't call me a villian
I do this shit everyday before i see the sun
Many people want to get more than a million
Then why you calling me crazy you know you ain't the one
Sorry, am also a bit nervous after this probably i'll hit the showers
And i ain't the kinda girl who really likes flowers
Wait, no that doesn't mean am a coward


[bridge]
Is this a dream or nah?
Can i say it's my life cause you treated me well ma?
I know i was more calm
Now am no harm
Looking upto you and all you say is that


[Chorus]
This ain't no rehearsal ,this ain't no game
I know you gonna say that i was a little pain
Let's ride down the lane
Hopes high we gonna gain
Looking up to you and all you say is that


[verse 2]
Lemme tell you one thing
I don't mind wanna ruling like a king
Yes you can say that am only sixteen
And for sure i can cause am not even mean
Hahaha am on my own space
Before and after that's a very different case
Maybe am never meant to always catch your gaze
Lemme leave you to finish that thing you call maze
Yeah, that's mawkish
Living here makes me feel so boyish
It's my life so you ain't gonna demolish
Almighty High knows that i ain't foolish

(bridge)
+
[Chorus]


[you been through alot of pain and for sure you can agree i was one of them
And am sorry cause most of them i never meant
Will you please forgive me?]x2

[Chorus:Fritzy]


[Intro: Che Ecru & Drake]

All your stupid exes, they gon' call again
Tell 'em that a real nigga steppin' in
Don't let them niggas try you, test your patience
Tell 'em that it's over, ain't no debatin' (Uh)
All you need is me playin' on your playlist
You ain't gotta be frustrated

Sweet like Pearland, sweet like Peachtree (Like that)
I can tell you crazy, but shit kind of intrigue me (No, yeah, I like that)
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
Seen it on the 'gram, I'm tryna see that shit in 3D, mami
I know I get around 'cause I like to move freely
(I don't, I don't)
But you could lock it down, I could tell by how you treat me
(I don't, I don't)
I seen how you did homeboy, so please take it easy (No, yeah)
Good to have me on your side, I ain't sayin' that you need me (Yeah, yeah)

I don't even wanna go back home
Hopefully, I don't leave you on your own

Fallin' in love really ain't for me
Pourin' it up, so I feel nothing
But I still can't sleep, niggas can't compete
You got it, babe, you got it (Yeah)
You got it, babe, you got it
Real ass nigga got a bag, I know you spendin'

Pull up with me, we gon' start a frenzy

[Chorus]
You got it, babe, you got it
You got it, babe, you got it

[Verse: Snoop Lion & Cori B.]
Money makes a man and that's a crime
If we all were rich, we'd spend more time
With our daughters and sons, they're losing their minds
We all feel hurt, here's mine, hear me now

[Chorus: Snoop Lion & Cori B.]
'Cause no guns are allowed in here tonight
We're gonna have a free-for-all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts, turn the music up loud

[Verse 1: Snoop Lion]
Let the music play, me don't want no more gunplay
When the bodies hit the ground, there's nothing left to say, ay, ay
Me don't want to see no more innocent blood shed
Me don't want to see no more youth dead
Come hear me now

[Chorus: Snoop Lion & Cori B.]
No guns are allowed in here tonight
We're gonna have a free-for-all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts, turn the music up loud

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, news from back home
This when it hurts to be gone
Two more young names to be carved out of stone
One summer day that went horribly wrong
Got my dawg on the phone
Cryin' and sayin' to leave him alone, but I'm not leavin' his side
I know that somebody died, somebody's child
Some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim
It is the shooter that picks 'em
They just can't wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didn't listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shyanne and Josh
And pour sumthin' out for the lives that they stole
416


[Chorus: Snoop Lion & Cori B.]
No guns are allowed in here tonight
We're gonna have a free-for-all, no fights
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts, turn the music up loud

[Outro: Snoop Lion & Cori B.]
Money makes a man and that's a crime
Money makes a man and that's a crime
I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
Yah! T.R.U., 2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that bla-kow, dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas, don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do, nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die, whattup?


[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true? That’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food, she got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out and I say, "Damn, that makes two of us"
Aww, that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?


[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some, I’ll out-rap his ass, out-trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass, take him out
Bring 'em in, them whole things, 2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t, went where they say I couldn’t (Tru!)
YSL belt buckle, y’all niggas sure is lookin'
Y’all niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do, nah, I just do it for the niggas

[Intro: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
(Wheel it!)
Yeah (Six!)
Yeah
Murda on tha beat so it's not nice

[Verse 1: Drake]
That’s Baka, he's a no-long-talker
Quick to let the motherfuckin' TEC slam
We don’t need to hear about a next man
Yutes talk down, then they get ran
Left them, get dipped from the whole ends
If Gilla call shots, no questions
G-Way til I'm restin'
But we still got love for the West End
If it's a chit-chat ting, better talk nice
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Skull gets hot, then I'm not nice
You tryna date her and she been let me wop twice

Nutty shit like somethin' just climbed out the X-Files (Ooh)

Home time, grab a quick drink and she gets wild
Sexy, and I rate that and her sex style (Switch it)
Fuckin' somethin', yeah nigga, fuckin' somethin' (Fuckin' somethin')

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Mástein Bennett]
Preach, preaching, oooh
I'm preaching, oooh (c'mon, uh, no)
Preaching (ayy)

[Verse: Mástein Bennett]
May I beg your fucking pardon? Sir, what the fuck is this about? (huh)
Thirteen like I'm Harden, bitch I'm ballin' all around
Them twelve steps, but look, on eleven I got out
What kind of bullshit is this? What the fuck am I gon' do now?
I rather take a fucking bullet than go through this shit again (yeah)
And there is no alternative, I'm addicted to the pain (yes)
Excuse me, I ain't got no manners, though you ain't no a fucking saint (uh huh)
Excuse me a little more because I guess I've gone insane
So by the grace of God it's why I don't feel outta place no more
Was it him? Is he real? ¿Sí? Oh my God, I'm outta control
I'm on my own and I don't need a fucking muppet to go on
Not about it, non-believer, nobody'd buy it on my honor
Fuck it, can you fucking see it? Made it look so fucking easy
"Easy peasy", bullshit truce, and the truth is that I believed it (uh)
How many prayers? How much power? Meditation, almost got me
Got my sayin', I'm so tired, I'm so fucked up, fuck, I'm out here, yeah

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Mástein Bennett]
Preach, preaching, oooh (I guess I'm better off alone)
I'm preaching, oooh
Preaching

[Outro: Natalie Major with Mástein Bennett]
I can't take it

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah I stay down with my day one niggas and we in the club screaming

[Hook: Drake]
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new

[Verse One: Clip]
Y'all niggas don't matter, you're really unimportant
Finna hit it, get it stacked up, you already support it
Spitting flow so sick that my vision get distorted
Slow it down for you niggas, can't afford to miss a moment
Fast-forward mass euphoria
Get it from my story, yeah
Me and Stunna met before we thought the fame in store for us
Threw a couple lines down, thought it was stupid
Wrote it for my nigga, wasn't really into music
That was three years ago, now this is what I'm doing
Diving in the game, feeling like I'm parachuting
Ima win it all, I ain't really into losing
All I'm losing is my mind, isn't like I ever use it
Ima bring it hard, industry will get bruises
I'm a hard choice but a nigga finna choose it
My friends and I a package deal
All this time and I haven't still made any

[Hook]

[Verse Two: P-Stunna]
Signed a contract with Paper Stunnas in 11
Since then in the studio, that's heaven
Cause I'm with my brother, and Nameless making cash
Rollin with no other cause new niggas'll get in your ass
That's why I been in the same studio
This humid cubicle
Since I was rockin skinnies and bumpin Snoop D-O
Fucking unruly hoes
Paper Stunnas never disappoint
From emotional tracks to the hottest joints
That's why I be with the illest team
In the industry
No one as ill as we
Packin delivery
Rollin with the same niggas since the beginning
I swear to Jah the only new people I meet is the women

[Hook]

[Outro: Future]
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cuz' I'm down for my niggas

Fuck her on the floor 'fore we make it to the bed
That's what yo' ass really call started from the bottom
Yes, Lord, OVO Sound, man, I'm proud of my niggas

All my bitches love me; if I had a baby mama
She would probably be richer than a lot of you niggas
Ayy, that's luxury, dawg

Follow codes, study game
Feed fam, nigga, fuck fame

These bad hoes keep tiptoein'
Down in Turks and Caicos
Dope boy, that's my dress code
All I hug is blood, nigga

All I want is love, nigga
Money bring that stress though
Smoke good, I love life
Strip club like e'ry night

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, I'm here with my niggas
I'm too high to be friendly
They throw dirt on my name
Well, that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hatin'
I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies
I wish we could trade places
Bitch, we good-fellas
Boy, all them niggas with you, they just pall bearers
And if we ball, catch us
Remember sip slow, live fast
Young Money, stay young
I been Cash Money since day one (Tunechi!)

[Chorus: Drake]

[Intro: Lil Juice]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I just flipped a switch (Flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doin' this
Bodies start to drop, ayy (Hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot, ayy
Give me my respect (Give me my respect)
I just took it left like I'm ambidex'
Bitch, I move through London with the Eurostep (Two)
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause I'm gone (Outta there, I’m gone)
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack (Servin' up a pack)
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap, ayy
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I’m a hard hitta
Yeah I’m light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm an unforgivin' wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a gravedigger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again


[Chorus: Mack Daddy Ju & Drake]
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'

My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'

[Verse 2: Drake]
Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that’s standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
(Gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went
(They don't love you no more)
You don’t wanna play with him (Nah, nah, nah)
They’ll be mournin' you like 8AM (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (Whoa, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (Big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (Woo yeah)
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit)
Either hand is the upper hand (Oh yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (Whoa, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can’t go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy!)


[Chorus: Mack Daddy Ju & Drake]
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
From smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot

[Intro]

[Chorus]
She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin' down
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix
Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

[Verse 1]
I'ma just give it to you direct, instead of me throwin' this shit
You know you important and shit
You know I'm supportin' this shit
We used to do pornos when you would come over but now you got morals and shit
I got like four on the wrist and an adorable kid
I got a Drac' in the studio, and I don't just mean that I'm in this bitch
Please make the most of this shit
Don't just come close to some shit
I give you this bread, you run me some head
And then you go glow up a bit


[Chorus]
She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to sli-
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix
Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

[Verse 2]
Her daddy is not around, mama is definitely not around
She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight

[Chorus]
She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to sli-
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix
Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came for my life and I'm just recordin' this shit



[Intro: Drake]
Whoa
Whoa
Yeah
Look

[Chorus: Drake]
Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

[Verse 1]
Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, ayy, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in
Man, I got a blunt, can I get a light? Yeah
I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "You took the summer off? We couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it, somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it, ah!

[Chorus: Drake]
Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help

Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

[Verse 2: Drake & Rick Ross]
Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (Aww, yeah)
Aww, yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (Hunh)
What's the word these days?
Bunch of niggas chasing after all these women they don't even know (Wooo!)
Buncha' out of season women fuckin' off-season niggas
To get last season wardrobe (Wooo!)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw (WOOO)

[Chorus: Drake]
Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', man ain't no tellin'

[Break: Drake]
No tellin'
Yeah
Look

[Verse 3: Drake]
I gotta keep watchin' for oppers
'Cause anything's possible, yeah
There's no code of ethics out here
Anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got
Let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta
Then eat in the kitchen like I'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though
European, my vehicle, how much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah
What am I willin' to give her to get what I want tonight?
Ain't no tellin'
Please do not speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago

[Verse 1]
Mixtape, I been working on this mixtape
Nigga if you been sleeping on me, that's a mistake
Just think, I been doing this since 6th grade
Back when all my Jay-Z covers only got like 6 plays
Did that satire shit and got on Renegade with J
Got on Rap Genius, then I did them verses with Sway
Now everybody telling me that all my shit's great
I'm like thanks but I think that ya'll a bit late
Aye, but at least now they seeing me
You officially listening to V.E.N.D
When it comes to MP3s, I'm the MVP
Nah it's all about me, I'm the TimVP
Man, I'm just rapping for respect, you know I gotta get it
Flexing on the track just like a nigga ate a lot of spinach
Did you get that last line? Man ya'll prolly didn't
Ya'll niggas still ain't get like half the lines in no competition, nah

No tellin', ain't no tellin'

[Verse 2]
Okay I had to switch the
Flow up on you niggas, shit was getting to predictable
Painting a picture with these words, the flow is visible
And if that is the case, then these ain't verses, they visuals
Now picture this, I'm not tryna get all deep and visceral
And you might find these theory to be completely dismissible
But how can you follow a crowd and be an individual?
That's oxymoronic, like the homeless performing rituals
It don't add up, so you niggas will never get the sum
If you can't see this star in the making, you'll never get the sun
If you can't see this war that I'm waging, then it's already won
Ya'll never been inspiring, believe me, this shit's already done
I just named 4 Crash songs, and you ain't even know it
All these niggas tryna save the game, they tryna be heroic
I'm just proving that ya boy can spit, and that you need to know it
But after this song, I don't really think that I need to show it, nah

[Verse]
They told me all of my lyrics are never ever fly
They told that I suck and that I should never try
They said "Virtual Entertainment Never Dies
All the songs are free cause it's shit that no one would ever buy"
Whole time I was like, okay whatever guys
All that negative bullshit, I set aside
Cause it turns out that them niggas were never right
Cause this verse is so much better than anything they'll ever write
If you a pest to me then consider this verse some pesticide
If they say that I'm wack, it's just some lies, I'm the best alive
Anyone wanna come prove me wrong? Then I suggest you try
Anyone wanna come at me wrong? Then I suggest you hide
With this tape, you know it's safe to say the best has just arrived
I bet you guys get petrified every time that I testify
The best is I, and it's about time I start getting recognized
When I meet Mr. West some time, that's when two of the best collide
I really hate to be this guy
But I think I'd rather be seen alive, than sing a lie
Nowadays, the real nigga get penalized
If they not rapping 'bout trapping more than a venus fly
You know I really hate to be this guy
But who says the limit has to be the sky?
That's a mentality that should be despised
Cause I'm out of this world, so that saying should really be revised
My talent will never be disguised, so you can't be surprised
If you niggas still can't see my rise, get some eagle eyes
Fuck how horribly this entire mixtape is equalized
I'm not tryna get on the radio, I'm tryna Ether guys
D.E.A.D. Entertainment, we on top, and you can't beat the guys
The clique is Susan Storm-Richards, you can't even see the guys
Rolling with the cheese and the dough, like the pizza guys
Came to give the game a spark, I'm feeling like I'm Lisa, guys
I'm going in, but I gotta save, I got 7 tracks left
Will them bitches be any good? Ain't no tellin'
Mixed this whole fucking thing by myself
Will these verses sound like they should? Ain't no tellin'
Police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, but we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'

Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'

[Intro: DJ Paul]
You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me

[Chorus: Drake]
Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way




You used to tag me on Facebook
You used to you used to
You used to tag me in Facebook
And tag me in posts
Tag me on Facebook
All day long
You know that notification bling
It can only mean one thing
You know that notification bling
It can only mean one thing

Cause ever since I blocked yo ass
You been talking to me with lots of sass





Instrumental: 6 God by Drake

[First Verse]
Why they telling me I can’t do it?
When they don’t know a fucking thing
They see happiness as something that the money brings
And I’m the dummy here that’s fumbling
I’m done with this/ me; I’m having none of it
Jumping out the thunder still I’m wondering
They hear my words but think of me as drunk I mean
Nothing I could conjure up would ever pick me up
I need something made of substance or I’ll always be kept underneath
And as much as I would love to be the one that cuts the leash
And lets you open up your minds and wander free
I just can’t/ used to think my father could
But if he failed then I don’t stand a fucking chance
I’m hearing stories of these people past their forties
Acting borderline mature and boy this shit’s just getting boring
So I’m calling just to call out this moronic kinda BS
And alleviate this stress/ I’m going all in ‘til I’ve poured it out

[Hook: Drake]
I’m not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I’m not new to this
Niggas wouldn’t make it on this side
I’m not new to this
I’m not new
I’m not new

[Second Verse]
Lord knows
He knows it better than you ever could
I’m feeling so unsettled
If you knew me well you’d know for sure
I never would attack you out of hate
In fact I feel I have to say I wrote this out of love
I’m only stepping foot in these territories
Simply ‘cause I’m sick of hearing everybody
Peddling their beefs and their opinions
Every second always talking him and her
And he did this and he got that and she got this and he knows her
You react in such a way that’s so confusing to me
‘Cause I grew up with you in my head as someone to look up to
Now I’m losing you/ believe me when I say I feel so stupid
Who could look up to some people hooked on beef
And just gossiping and frolicking in politics
And all of it’s just knocking on my head
This shit’s a problem
So I’m shooting just to hook you in
And help you out before I snap and have to look towards the hookah
Temper rising ‘cause I’m trapped inside this pressure cooker
Surrounded by these people I should break my neck to look up to
But every time I look up I don’t see a thing
So only place to look now is look down
And look at all these overgrown children
Hold in my emotion with an overdose building
Sober up and hoping for a colder soul
Still sit holding onto hope although I know it won’t kill this
Bullshit so I’m diving in this pool and going comatose
Ill shit/ my anger’s got this pen in my hand
Penning this banger as penance for any disrespect
I may have sent your way
Let me reassess my manners
But this ain’t no apology
I just feel uncomfortable
I’m airing out my family but still I feel I need to do it
Just to get this off my chest
I’m mad but see I love you still
I fucking will until my end
I’ll punch your grill from time to time
In the hope I let you know just how I fucking feel
Throw dirt on my state of mind/ no doubt it’s messy
Give a shout to Messi/ put me on this beat to beat it down
And show how deadly I can get if you were to ever send a hint
That you’d go out your way to just go disrespect me
‘Cause I can be as disrespectful as Fifty dissing Game and Buck
Or Shady taking ladies and their babies
And explaining how his chainsaw’s gonna wake ‘em up
It’s crazy how I use to be
Now usually I straight up question anyone that says some shit
That’s news to me/ I’ve grown up/ still see the world as beautiful
But thing is now I just don’t act as beautifully
And I feel like friend or fam I’ll end it now
This is who I grew into/ who gives a shit?
You knew me then/ try know me now
I hold my sound in ‘til I spit
Then I’m back to laying low
I’ll show you how
You get close
You sit back
Don’t get close
Then next step – stay mellow
And then what?
You get fucking used to me
Ha…

Watchin' my back even when I'm in the booth
Oh, trust who?
Doin' my thing, but I'm down to come clean, not like you
I wanna make you feel the weight's off your shoulders too

And even if it is that crazy, baby
I'll take it
I want you, I know you're not an angel
Not you
Oh, just save it
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm wavy and I'm sayin' things
That I don't mean, but I do mean
And I don't want you to miss me
'Cause there's no way that you're sorry
And you're crying and you're sayin' things
That I do believe, but I don't even
Want you to get in my mind
I'm supposed to be in your mind (Oh woah)

Trust me and I can set you free
Left your man, came straight to me
You the real MVP, my love
Ride dirty like Pimp C
You a real ten-speed freak, shawty
You was everything a nigga need
You was everything to me, my love
Why you keep that little shit from me?
Left me down on bended knee
When I scooped you in the Maybach
The only time a nigga ever made you take a backseat
Why you do that little shit to me, shawty?
When you know that we was meant to be
Why'd you keep those things from me, my love? (Love)
I've given you enough time

[Chorus: Drake with Chris Brown]
Hurtin' deeply inside
Trust
Trust
Hurtin' deeply, deeply

[Outro: Drake]
Thought I knew the real, then they flipped
How many times did I ask about this, on God?
Why you let me find out like this, on God?
Houston, we got a problem, my dawg
All my niggas love you, got us all involved
Ain't no goin' back to how we started off
No, no, no, no

[Intro]
One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

[Verse 2]
And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Chorus]
I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow
But I do it to her

[Bridge]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know
I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like, like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone




[Produced by Jimmy Johnson & Eric Dingus]

[Bridge 1]
It's over, it's over, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I can't stay here no more, and I can't sleep on the floor
Man, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah, I'm leaving, yeah, I'm leaving, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone, had to knock down the wall
Yeah, I swear to God that I'm gone, I'm leaving, I'm leaving
No looking back when I'm gone, no looking back when I'm gone
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more

[Chorus]
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more

[Verse 1]
It's over, it's over, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I've been doing this wrong, I've been here for too long
I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid that I'ma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'ma be alone, I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road, I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit the road, I just gotta know the road
I just gotta know the road

[Bridge 2]
Something to say, then say that then
I just been out and bad from way back when
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
You got something to say, then say that then
I just been out and bad from way back when
I gotta get on the road, I gotta get on the road
I ain't looking back no more, no, no, no
No more, no more, no more

[Chorus]
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more

[Verse 2]
I gotta go out and get it, want you to know what I did
Want you to know how it went
That's why I keep telling you over and over again
Just let me go
Just let me go, let me bring it home to you
Just let me go, let me bring it home to you
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
Just let me go, let me bring it home

You see bad bitches and fall in love
I be talking arithmetic in the club, re-negotiations
Young Frank
I seen all of your favorite girls naked
And mental pictures were taken, I never forget they faces
They're lucky I can't draw, but still I'm artistic
Money on the way It's got both of my palms itching
You boys in the wrong business, for real
You boys in the wrong business
All this sitting back and watching will make you a strong witness
Testify on how I'm living, make sure it's non-fiction
Don’t leave out anybody that put me in this position
We couldn’t have done it better
We changed this city forever
Puffin shisha, lay back fucking with FIFA
What I get for the feature I wouldn't fuck with me either for real
Now I'm in it for the hoes and the checks
Care less about respect from niggas I never met
Champagne

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
I know my city going crazy right about now
Broke nigga, so I'm greedy
Break a nigga down if they don't feed me
Yo girl break her neck the same second that she see me
And I bet my last nickel that she eff with Sweet Petey
Bradley Cooper, a future is limitless
I'm infinite, take a photo of the synthesis
Grandmama got Alzheimer's but she'll remember this
Ain't no way that she won't remember
I wake up every mornin' shower, gather my belongings
But I just quit my job, but got some pussy cause I'm balling
From AM to PM, beefing with the BM
Beefing with the boss, got fired by the GM
Fuck, I lost my nigga to a goddamn murder
In his own kitchen, with his own goddamn burner
You ain't no goddamn boss
You a goddamn worker
Fuck beef when niggas dying for a goddamn burger
My nigga, all we know is this pain
Chain smoking in the city where they smoke you for chains
Jamaica house to croaker spot, riding round smokin pot
On Broad Street we all drink -- PBR and Rolling Rock
Do this to get money, that ain't enough
Do this for my city, that ain't enough
Im like Andre 3k, 16 ain't enough
I get down like Curtis Snow
Dare you to call my bluff
Bet you it won't pick up
We ride box Chevys but we built Ford tough
And I bet you that we won't give up
The pigs try to lock us down
But we broke through cuffs




[Letra de "Odio" ft. Drake]

[Intro: Drake, Romeo Santos]
Yeah, yeah
Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece, pero tú desvaneces
Y  me ofreces tu amistad sin otra excepción
Sé que hay otro hombre que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir; perdón por hacerte daño

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Verso 2: Drake, Drake & Romeo Santos, Romeo Santos]
Celo sus besos sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí y te quiero aquí
Odio ese hombre porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada, nada

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Interludio: Romeo Santos & Drake]
Escucha las palabras
Yeah, drizzy Drake

[Puente: Romeo Santos]
Yo fui el llanto, él es tu sonrisa (turn the lights on)
Y lo nuestro desplomó sobre un volcán muy de prisa

[Verso 3: Drake]
Uh, you were the one
You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you, you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don't worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I'll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio, aunque él te haga feliz
A mi nada me intimida, pero entiendo
Que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí




[Intro: Jay-Z (Timbaland)]

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I'm so tomorrow the Audemar says yesterday
Which means you on time delay
So even if I slow it dowwwwwn
My sound is fast forward, hold up
I'm just a runway show
But I wear that so my plane, these my runway clothes
Hehe, Cashmere sweats
They come out next year but these my last year sweats
And my ho's so sick
Your new chick can't fuck with my old bitch
And you know this shit
I'm professional, they novices
I just may let you borrow this
This the Blueprint, nigga follow this
This what what tomorrow is
Welcome to tomorrow BIIIIIIIIIII

[Chorus: Drake (Jay-Z)]
Whatever you about to discover we off that
You about to tell her you love her we off that
Always wanna fight in the club and we off that
But you can't bring the future back, back
Y'all are steady chasin the fame and we off that
Oversized clothes and chains we off that
Niggas still making it rain and we off that
'Cause you can't bring the future back, back
Tell them haters get off me, the Cris' we off that
Timbs we off that, rims we off that
(Yeah we off that, is you still on that?)
(And we still makin money 'cause we still on that)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
This ain't black vs. white, my nigga we off that
Please tell Bill O'Reilly to fall back
Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls
It's 2010, not 1864
Uhh, yeah we come so far
So I drive around town, hard top and it's off
Uhh, in my TriBeCa loft
With my high brow art, and my high yellow broad
Uhh, and my dark-skinned sis
And my best white mate, say what's up to Chris
Uhh, how's that for a mix?
Got a black president, got green presidents
"Blueprint's" in my white iPod
Black diamonds in my Jesus piece, my God
Uhh, we ain't tripping off that
This a Benetton ad, nigga been up off that, uhh

[Chorus: Drake (Jay-Z)]
Whatever you about to discover we off that
You about to tell her you love her we off that
Always wanna fight in the club and we off that
But you can't bring the future back, back
Y'all are steady chasin the fame and we off that
Oversized clothes and chains we off that
Niggas still making it rain and we off that
Cause you can't bring the future back, back
Tell them haters get off me, the Cris' we off that
Timbs we off that, rims we off that
(Yeah we off that, is you still on that?)
(And we still makin money cause we still on that)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I don't give a fidduck abiddout the widdate
You used to move, what you used to do
And I don't give a fidduck abiddout the bitches
That you used to screw, what your future do
And we don't really care what you used to say
Unless that affects your future pay
I'm on a practice field runnin' Two-A-Days
So I don't drop the ball when it's threw my way
So I don't give a fidduck abiddout the shit
That you probably did, who you probably is
The only time I deal in past tense
'Cause I'm past rims, and I'm past tints
If you drivin' it, I drove it
You got it, 'cause I sold it
You copped it, I bought it back
And we don't give a fidduck, nigga we off that

[Chorus: Drake (Jay-Z)]
Whatever you about to discover we off that
You about to tell her you love her we off that
Always wanna fight in the club and we off that
But you can't bring the future back, back
Y'all are steady chasin the fame and we off that
Oversized clothes and chains we off that
Niggas still making it rain and we off that
Cause you can't bring the future back, back
Tell them haters get off me, the Cris' we off that
Timbs we off that, rims we off that
(Yeah we off that, is you still on that?)
(And we still makin money cause we still on that)

[Chorus: Wizkid]

Oh, I can’t explain

[Chorus: Drake]
Are you feeling good tonight?
This thing got me thanking God for life
I just can't explain
I can't explain, no, no, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, it's gon' be a long long time 'fore we stop
Boy better know, they better know who make the scene pop
All I ever needed was a chance to get the team hot
Only thing I fear is a headshot or a screenshot
Pree me, dem a pree me
You know they only call me when they need me
I never go anywhere, they never see me
I'm the type to take it easy, take it easy
I took girls in the very first text I sent
I don't beg no lovers, I don't beg no friends
If you wanna link, we can link right now
Skeppy Wiz and Drake, it's a ting right now
Are you feeling good tonight

[Chorus: Wizkid]
This thing got me thanking God for life
Oh, I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah
I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah

[Verse 3: Skepta]
When I was in school, being African was a diss
Sounds like you need help saying my surname, Miss
Tried to communicate
But everyday is like another episode of Everybody Hates Chris
Ever since mum said, "Son you are a king"
I feel like Floyd when I'm stepping into the ring
Just spoke to the boy, said he's flying in with a ting
We're touching the road to celebrate another win, we're going in
Why am I repping these ends? Man I don't know
The government played roulette with my postcode
All I know is it's where my people dem are suffering
I seen it before, narrate the story as it unfolds
Dad certified the settings and my mum knows
My mind full of more bullets than your gun holds
Now I got the peng tings in the front row
Saying, "Skeppy come home, baby come home!"
Yeah, I love the sun but I respect the rain
Look forward to good times, can't forget the pain
I was the kid in school with the £10 shoes
White socks, jack-ups and the pepper grains
Said they're gonna respect me for my ambition
Rest in peace my niggas that are missing
I had to tell my story cause they'd rather show you
Black kids with flies on their faces on the television

[Bridge: Wizkid]
Eh e kira fun mummy mi o
Ojojumo lo n s’adura
Mon jaiye mi won ni won soro ju
Ojojumo owo n wole wa
E kira fun mummy mi o
Ojojumo lo n s’adura
Mon jaiye mi won ni won soro ju
Won ni won ni won soro ju

[Chorus: Wizkid]
I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
Oh, I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah
I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah


[Verse]
Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah



[Verse 1: Drake]
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm a optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like "What the fuck is he planning?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin's cause business is business, its strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out where there's no paparazzi
I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Real nigga movement, young nigga year
Lookin so fresh, you'd thought I was a queer
Feeling like homer simpson drinkin out a beer
Money in the front, with the lean in the rear
Get him out of here, swag of the year
Young Soulja Boy, I went and tattooed all my tears
Damn I had no fears, I feel like a bitch
Shoutouts to Lil B, I'm sitting on my dick
Pull up to the trap, hoes like damn
All this fucking money, bitch I think I'm uncle sam
Tatted on my wrist and my clip don't jam
Soulja Boy Tell Em, in the kitchen cooking yams
Trap goin ham, speakers going hammer
Took your main bitch, then I bammed her and I bammed her
Yeah, I rammed her than I jammed her
Nutted in her mouth
I fucked that bitch in Alabamer


[Verse 1: Kiana Ledé]
You know that people gon' change
Feelings they all seem to fade
Lovers they all drift away
And become so damn estranged

[Pre-Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
Friends flip they turn into foes
But humble and quiet no more
Even as life seems to fade

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I'm still alive, I'm on a wave
I'm on a ride, I'm everywhere
I'm hard to find, don't need a man
Ain't got the time, busy as fuck
You know what's up, stay on my grind
But I still play, these niggas hearts
I never stay, yeah, I'm out of love
Just thinkin' of, me n' mine, me n' mine

[Verse 2: Drake & Kiana Ledé]
You finally start to care
I show up so unprepared
You're ready for something new
I'm still where I was last year
I'm tired of talkin' it out
I just left my clothes at you're house
Seems like you're wantin' to stay


[Chorus: Kiana Ledé + Drake]
But you need to know
I'm on a wave/I'm on a ride (ride)
I'm everywhere/I'm hard to find (I'm hard to find)
Don't want a man/I'm just a guy/ you're just a guy
Busy as fuck (busy as fuck)
You know what's up (you know what's up)

[Verse 3: Drake]
And I got a life now
Back where I stay (back where I stay)
Still pay a car note for this girl around my way (around my way)

[Kiana Ledé]
Yeah 11x

[Pre-Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
Friends flip
They turn into foes
But humble and quiet no more
Even as life seems to fade

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I'm still alive/I'm on a wave
I'm on a ride/I'm everywhere
I'm hard to find/Don't need a man
Ain't got the time/Busy as fuck
You know what's up/Stay on my grind
But I still play/These niggas hearts
I never stay (yeah)/I'm out of love
Just thinkin' of /Me n' mine, me n' mine


[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I'm on a wave/I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere /I'm hard to find
Don't need a man/Ain't got the time
Busy as fuck/You know what's up



[Verse 1: Drake]
You finally start to care
I show up so unprepared
You're ready for something new
I'm still where I was last year
Meanwhile we're talking it out
You keep leaving things at my house
Seems like you're wanting to stay
But you need to know..

[Hook 1: Drake]
I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a man, I'm just a guy
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
Now got a life, back where I stay
Still pay a car note for this girl, around my way

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
You got the game and the talk
Keep turnin' out how I thought
Kept my feelings on low, all alone
Intuition never ever wrong
So what the hell, mix some vodka with Italian
Carousel, hitting circles I'm a stallion
And I'm a real one nigga, I'm my own med
You looking so damn thirsty, let me throw it back
Baby we are on to something, maybe if we had the time
Used to give my love for nothing, trust me, I'll be alright

[Hook 2: Tinashe]
I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a girl, I'm on my grind
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
I got a life, back where I stay
Alicia’s still my only girl around my way

[Outro: Tinashe]
I said baby, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
Baby I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on a wave, wave
I said baby, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
Baby I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on a wave, wave


[Verse 1: Conor Maynard]
Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe

Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand

You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you get a text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

[Chorus: Conor Maynard & Harper]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go

Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Nothing like you and me
I don’t know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
Fell in love with the music
The feeling is mutual
Loving the way you move on me
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on, you know

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I need a one dance

One more time ’fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

Se acabó el tiempo y quiero hacerte feliz
Todo lo que escribo es para ti
No más peleas

[Intro]
So girl
You just be honest with me
I know we can make this work
I love you
I know that you afraid, babe
But you don't need to be saved, babe
You just need someone who understands
And I think I need the same, babe

[Verse 1]
Show me where you at, let's keep it honest
Home is where you at and that's a promise
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby, nothing
Tell me what you want, let's keep it gangsta
Tell me who created you, I'd thank her
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all
Give it all to you


[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you want, I can't believe it
I know that if we make it there's a reason
Sometimes the sun shines, baby
Sometimes it ain't breezy
I hope that maybe this time it may be different
I told you I'mma make it, that commitment
Yeah, you took your shot and didn't miss it
Ain't nothing more attractive than ambition

[Pre-Chorus]
Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all
Give it all to you


[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

[Bridge]
If I came to your crib, would you open the door?
I don't wanna go down that road, no more
Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more
You're the only one I wanna be with, yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

[Verse 1]
Look, I ain't never had a benzo
Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo
Nosey niggas is peakin' in my window
Have a hard time looking
I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking
Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage
Instead, I drop bars like I'm two months sober
Its my time now so them you months over

Yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that
I'm trying to get to the point where I can sit back
Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so I'm anticipating relaxing
I'm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts
I don't need brothers fillin' space in the back than
So from the kid with the sun tan flow
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show

[Chorus]
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E


[Verse 2]
I can easily make'em admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah you best believe that I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So they don't like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me
I can't lie sometime it bother me slightly

Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell
And no this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that I do that well
And the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-L [As in Samuel Jackson]
I've been real though [?]
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble but I live vain
With more deals on the table than a bridge game

[Chorus]
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E

Diamonds hang around my neck the crib is all finish
No love for these bitch, This year is all business
It is a shame that a couple of them are off limits
No offense to my nigga, Its just the industry small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know we ain't trippin
I know I got a couple things that Lil Wayne dip in
That Lil Wayne dip in

This shit is all about hits and miss's

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried  'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons, Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only


[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint, ayy

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky (Ayy)
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only


[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean "pop-pop-pop," then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"


[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

Raemi just turned mommy, and that's my sis, so I just turned abti
Fan mail came to the crib from a yute that loves me, I swear that touched me
I never even drive no whips I own, so they all look way too dusty
If me and Gallest go St. Michael, the gyal come way too fussy, crushy
Man said they would do this and that, but the man wasn't really that wassi, was he?
Nah, nah, nah, the man wasn't really that what?
One-nine-four-two hits my system, man get way too frosty, buzzy
Girls from the past that lost me love me
Same ones there that crossed me, cuss me
Everything come full circle, word to the boss above me
Slow stroking 'cause the bamski way too big, my gyal don't rush me
Woi
Don't make me have to rise my rifle
Man try send some young boys for me, don't make me have to ride by high school
Shit you man been droppin' lately, don't make me have to fly my iTunes
So much people buy into my hype, don't make me have to buy my hype too
Dealt with the big homie already, don't make me have to side-by-side you
Nuff times he tried to hide behind you
Amnesia but when I remind you
I'm touchin' road and I can't find you
Word to the M-O-B I'm tied to
I'm givin' up when I decide to, jheeze

The clock that you’ve been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands will say
They'll say

[Chorus: Drake]
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need’s an address and I’m on my way
Don’t fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it’s worth waiting for
Because I’m on my way

[Verse 2: James Fauntleroy]
Won't hurt, it's just some turbulence we're dropping
Dont be afraid
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
I'll keep you safe, so safe


[Chorus: Drake]
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through

Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in

Don’t fall asleep

Open - Lexxy Lyrics

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
They say that
Drunk minds, talk sober thoughts, yeah
And is it me that you want, me that you want
I guess it’s me that you want tonight
Cause I think we talk more when your intoxicated, inebriated
And baby I hate it
Cause I think that this the only way you gone open up to me
Gone talk to much to me
Cause this is how this goes I know it
Take one drink to the head and everything just feels right
And if it ain’t right, it’s alright, alright, tonight
I guess amnesia is your thing you do in the morning
Nobodies calling you
You just do that to leave the room, like you always do
I never need you, I just I just wanted you
Wanted, wanted you to love me but trust me
Put thing above me just, put your heart in my hands, yeah
Let me make all the plans, make all the plans, let me make all the plans tonight
Sober thoughts, Sober thoughts, oh yeah oh yeah
Guess it’s me that you want, me that you want, guess it’s me that you want tonight
Can we just be
Open tonight
Cause I know tomorrow we won’t
Hope you remember
Last time September
You said you wouldn’t loose this
Funny right now you won’t quit it, won’t quit
For me and all of them
Yet you wanted me and all of them
You don’t remember that
And I don’t remember you
Drunk minds talk sober thoughts yeah
I guess it’s me that you want, me that you want, guess it’s me that you want tonight
Drunk minds talk sober thoughts awe yeah
Guess it’s me that you want
Guess it’s me that you want

[Intro]
Murda on the beat

[Chorus: Booggz]
Yeah, huh, turned this to an organization
I fuck the bitch, I leave her waitin'
This car a demon, you know that I'm Satan
Ear cost a mil', me and Buck was at Nathan
It's not the picture, invest in the paintin'
Just made a hundred, don't care what they makin'
He shoot the fifth, you see the fifth shakin'
Pots on the stove, but I don't do bakin'
Famous Crip, plus I got blue faces
He catchin' bodies, he ain't catchin' cases
Don't shoot the whole clip, my nigga, don't waste it
Goods in the mansion, my nigga, don't take it
I see the mils, man, I could taste it
How you workin' hard and it's just a day shift? (Mm-hmm)
I'm in the Wraith, it feel like a spaceship (Uh)

[Verse 1: Smiley]
I took your bitch on vacation
But she wanna call it baecation
I wanna know where the hate is
I do not know who the fake is
Niggas ain't get you no statements
I put my shooters on payments
They pop a Perky, ain't playin'
How you broke? I make money off Caitlyn
I was broke, no one believed in me
I became what she ain't see in me
Now you see how she treatin' me
Now she sees the G in me, she ain't leavin' me
Now her and her friends they believe in me
Even the opps still believe me
Whole gang, they believe me
I don't know what to do with me
I'm bigger than what they see in me
I ain't checkin' you niggas, you ain't here with me
Hmm-mm-mm-mm
I ain't checkin' you niggas, you ain't here with me (Here with me)


[Chorus: Booggz]
Yeah, huh, turned this to an organization
I fuck the bitch, I leave her waitin'
This car a demon, you know that I'm Satan
Ear cost a mil', me and Buck was at Nathan
It's not the picture, invest in the paintin'
Just made a hundred, don't care what they makin'
He shoot the fifth, you see the fifth shakin'
Pots on the stove, but I don't do bakin'
Famous Crip, plus I got blue faces
He catchin' bodies, he ain't catchin' cases
Don't shoot the whole clip, my nigga, don't waste it
Goods in the mansion, my nigga, don't take it
I see the mils, man, I could taste it
How you workin' hard and it's just a day shift?
I'm in the Wraith, it feel like a spaceship

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Look, turned this to an organization
Used to have bashments down in the basement
Look in the ceiling, pink foam insulation
Now we just link up for corporate occasions
Say she been fuckin' with me since the Hazelton
If I don't like how he's movin', I'm pagin' him
Hear that they dissin', back then, I was raisin' 'em
Niggas is in for the rudest awakenin'
Walls are so tall I don’t know who my neighbor is
Baka, my crodie, his songs are amazing
But I knew that nigga when he wasn't makin' 'em
Yeah, turned this to a organization
Rap-A-Lot Mob, we tied up like laces
Bank in Bahamas, you know I'm evasive
I got my money in ten different places
GME, B.O.B., joint operations
If it's a problem, I'm droppin' location
Or I send Kayla, she's very persuasive


[Chorus: Booggz]
Yeah, huh, turned this to an organization
I fuck the bitch, I leave her waitin'
This car a demon, you know that I'm Satan
Ear cost a mil', me and Buck was at Nathan
It's not the picture, invest in the paintin'
Just made a hundred, don't care what they makin'
He shoot the fifth, you see the fifth shakin'
Pots on the stove, but I don't do bakin'
Famous Crip, plus I got blue faces
He catchin' bodies, he ain't catchin' cases
Don't shoot the whole clip, my nigga, don't waste it
Goods in the mansion, my nigga, don't take it
I see the mils, man, I could taste it
How you workin' hard and it's just a day shift?
I'm in the Wraith, it feel like a spaceship



[Demo Version Lyrics]

What if I kissed you right now
How would we explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don’t really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
If we were a secret how long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
...away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine

What if I kissed you right now...

Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off of our shoulders
Tell on me
I dont mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie...

...admit that I’m yours
I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions

If we were a secret
Tell me could u keep it?
Keep it your yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
...away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine

What if I kissed you right now
What if I kissed you right now

Just be mine (just be mine)
And u just be mine.. all mine
And u just be mine (just, just be mine)
And u just be mine.. all mine

[Piano Outro]



[Verse 1: Drake]
I've been thinkin' maybe
Things were never the
Way we made 'em out to be
How we thought they were
Lately, I'm not sure
One thing for sure
Is when we're together
We're toxic as ever
Make no mistake, all the roads lead
To we shouldn't be together

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't know why I
Still play into your palm
Even though I know what you want
Been twisted off you so long, oh-ho
'Cause it's complicated, far from simple
Always find a way to dodge thеse issues
Can't seem to shake it, not for nothing
Thе problem is we're not discussin'
All that screaming, yelling's not becomin' of you
Things just can't be fixed, we're out of time

[Bridge: Bryson Tiller]
Time, oh yeah
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Oh, turns out I don't
Know, know you, no, not anymore, no
And I can't wait 'til we find a way to part ways
Seems like your days are dark days
Seems like you're mad at the small things, I
Admit it, it seems like you're playin' it the hard way
We fight through the night, all day

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
I, I still don't know why I
Still play into your palm
Even though I know what you want
I've been twisted on you for so long
For so long, girl (Yeah, yeah)
Got me twisted, I could only wait for so long
For so long, girl (For so long)
Waited so long, but we got no time, no

[Outro: Bryson Tiller]

Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it


[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 2]
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh


[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Jackie Long]
And I'ma leave on one more note
One more motherfuckin' note
It's like this, look at him

[Intro: Drake]
I ain't been here in a minute
Cut the lights off
I feel fantastic right now, baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
I said I used to keep the porch lights on
And now I keep the Porsche's lights on
Just to let them know their foresight's wrong
Where this rapper goin' with that obscure ice on?
He a lame, I'm just tryna get my mature life on
OD, OD, everybody know me
Even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C.
Oh me, oh my, them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip, get a glass, pour the X.O. in
I dare one of these niggas to say I'm not insane
Pick a road 'cause where you drivin' is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C, life is not a game
Takin' over the world, no Pinky, just a lotta brain
He 'bout to send them the shit that I'm on
You prob'ly could have predicted I'm on
My sense of judgment's officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the Swisher is blown
I'm grown, I'm grown
I'm livin' in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high I'm never comin' down
And you say you got them hoes, but they never comin' round
I got Penthouse walls, I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over (bitches), but money's over (her)
'Cause money's under (nothin'), my life is such a (blur)
That's not the way it has to go, that's just what I prefer
And do not disagree with me, it's best you just concur
I'm a legend with a legacy that can't help but survive
Even when I fuckin' die they gonna bury me alive

[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good, grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good (OD, OD)
Bitches over there, we good (OD, OD)
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me

[Verse 2: Travis McCoy]
Oh no, Travie high on life again
Feel like I swallowed a whole bottle of Vicodin
So high I wanna cry like tiny violins
In my best mode, Depeche Mode, enjoy the silence
Stop the violence – how, when every line
Is like the motherfuckin' Watts riots pourin' out of my pen?
Aight then, be easy, I'ma get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics
But I can't leave the crib without some xanax in my wallet
Hello, my name is Travie, and I'm a life-aholic
Told 'em all these beats is like the Wallace to my Gromit
The Alfred to my Bruce Wayne, stripes on my candy cane
One without the other, Soul 4 Real without the Candy Rain
Super trooper like a gun-totin' handyman
Ask me how I'm livin', bet I tell ya fine and dandy, man
Check his vital signs, they peakin' off the meter, man
I'ma live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
Fuck pullin' the 9 out, I'll pull a Amy Winehouse
Sippin' Purple Rain with Mary Jane girls in my house
Isaiah, I'ma see ya when I get there
Until then hold me down like gravity, it's Travie (Uno, easy)

[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good, grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good (OD, OD)
Bitches over there, we good (OD, OD)
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Ha! I’m 'bout to overdose on life
Somebody please pass the needle
So if I comatose tonight you won't have to ask the people
If the things that I seen through my Prada frames got me paid
Watch me, mane, I'm a cocky slave with this Rocky chain
I got I got my veins cluttered with this bud
And this name of it is Fame and it's all up in my blood
Tryna suppress the too fresh feeling I got, ooh yes
I'm in it for the hugest duplex, livin' like I'm Hugh Hef
Every other night I need a brunette for group sex
Leave 'em with a bruised neck, then I yell: "Who's next?"
Stand 'em in a line
This is New Factz City, take this crack between your thighs
(Yeah, Mickey, what you mean?)
I'm promethazine, fuck the Queen
Sniff the white horse of success and then let him lean
(Let 'em see…) Tryna match my high on life
(Then let 'em dream…) Gotta catch the spot on my flight
First-class, known of the aroma of the smoker life
Got me like a stoner, a zoner, but nah, it's never over
(Mickey, what you mean?) I stick my tongue out
Sippin' Remy conceited, I'm teasin' every bum out
Hung out with celebrities from every drug house
So when you remember me say that I was strung out
(Mickey, what you mean?) I'm a addict for the green cash
I'ma OD, so fluck goin' to rehab

[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good, grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good (OD, OD)
Bitches over there, we good (OD, OD)
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me




[Intro: Drake]
(And Imma leave on one more note
One more motherfucking note
It's like this... Look at him
I ain't been here in a minute)
Cut the lights off I feel fantastic right now baby...
Yeah... Look...

[First Verse: Drake]
I said I used to cut the porch lights on and now I cut the porches lights on just to let them know their foresight's wrong
Where this rapper going with that obscure ice on he a lame I'm just tryna get my mature life on
O.D., O.D. Everybody know me, even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C
Oh me Oh my them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip get a glass pour the XO in
I did want one these niggas to say that I'm not the same
Pick a road cause where you driving is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C life is not a game
Taking over the world no Pinky just a lot of Brain
He bout to send them the shit that I'm on (Yeah)
You probably could have predicted I'm on (Yeah)
My sense of judgment's a officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the swisher is blown
Ahh... I'm grown, I'm grown, I'm living in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high, I'm never coming down and you say you got them hoes but they never coming 'round
I got penthouse bars I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over (Bitches)
But money's over (Her)
Cause money's under (Nothing)
My life is such a (Blur)
That's not the way it has to go that's just what I prefer
And do not disagree with me it's best you just concur
I'm a legend with a legacy that can't help but survive
Even when I fucking die they're going to bury me alive...

[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm living good gripping wood with all the features
Jesus my money straight no creases
Peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air... we good (O. D. O.D.)
Bitches over there... we good (O. D. O. D.)
Money on the floor we good
O.D. O.D everybody know me

[Second Verse: Travie McCoy]
Oh no Travie high on life again... (Wow)
Feel like I swallowed a whole bottle of Vicodin... (Dam)
So high I wanna cry like tiny violins
In my best mode the pesmote enjoy the silence... (Shh)
Stop the violence, how when every blind is like the motherfucking Watts riots pouring out my pen
Alright then be easy I'm a get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics but I can't leave the crib without some Xanax in my water... (Nope)
Hello my name is Travie and I'm a lifeaholic
Told'em all these beats is like the Wallace to my Gromitt... (Ha)
The alpha to my Bruce Wayne, stripes on my candy cane
Worn without the other so for real without the candy brain
Super trooper like a gun tote in candyman
Ask me how I'm living bet I tell ya fine and dandy man
Check his vital signs they peaking off the meter man
Imma live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
Fuck pulling the nine out
Imma pull a Amy Winehouse
Sipping Purple Rain with Mary Jane girls in my house... (My House)
Isaiah I'm a see ya when I get there
Until then hold me down like gravity it's Travie, Uno, Easy

[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm living good gripping wood with all the features

[Third Verse: Mickey Factz]
Ha I'm bout to overdose on life somebody please pass the weed
So if I comatose tonight you won't have to ask for reefer
If the things that I seen through my Prada frames got me paid
Watch me man, I'm cocky slave with this Rocky chain
I got I got my veins cluttered with this bud
And this name of it is fame and it's all up in my blood
Trying to suppress the too fresh feeling I got... Oooh yes

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl this summer, you'll be looking for (Yeah)
You’ll be looking for me while I’m riding in
That brand new whip you wanted (Ooh, yeah yeah)
All I ever asked for was patience (That's all I ever asked and you know it)
Patience and pussy but mostly patience (Yeah, yeah 'cause you gon' use it anyway)
Swear I used to keep you faded
Now you're waiting for something better
But girl what's better than this? (Ooh)
We were supposed to do big things (Do big things)
Now you're waiting for something better
But girl, what's better than this?

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Popping champagne over here
Girl it ain't a thang over here
Throwing money fast over here
Blowing all this cash over here (Yeah)
Popping champagne over here (Oh yeah)
Girl it ain't a thang over here (Oh yeah)
Throwing money fast over here (Oh yeah)
Blowing all this cash over here (Oh yeah)
On this side

[Verse 2: Drake]
Me and my niggas bucking head first
You supposed to be there when my head hurt
Used to be going out hardly, now we wanna party
Celebration on me, well what's up
Pay homage, I roll through the city like young Sheikh Mohammed
It can't be that hard to find us
Go to Jungle, pick up my Ethiopian goddess
That's when words spread, a Bugatti is in the projects
The boy home, used to take the bus to the block
Now summertime whips come through and bust up the block
I remember seeing Nikk's having to bust up a block
And sell the work right to hush, y'all niggas must have forgot
But I was there Nas don shit, a couple things sit on my conscience
With that said, look at all we accomplished
Yea, sure this ain't Compton but this ain't a fairytale land neither
We all lost mad people, the city wild
They gave the task to a purposeful child
Verses start to get a little more personal now
But that’s cause everybody else sound is so played out though
Oliver North in the cut Dolce'd out though
A thousand dollar bottle it get poured straight out though
I'm screaming OVO on the whole way out though
I'm back boy for real, I'm that boy for real
I got hits nigga, you just a batboy for real
Backwoods get peeled, I smoke away all the tears
Nothing was the same man, including y'all careers
The new Cash Money, the new Roc-A-Fella
Bunch of young rich niggas, turn around if you jealous

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Popping champagne over here
Girl it ain't a thang over here
Throwing money fast over here
Blowing all this cash over here
Popping champagne over here (One time)
Girl it ain't a thang over here (Two time)
Throwing money fast over here
Blowing all this cash over here
On this side




[Intro: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1: Drake]
I think I killed e'rybody
In the game last year, man, fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
At the strip club, mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
Yeah, I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Chorus: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 2: Drake]
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Chorus: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Outro]
Three in the morning, still going down

[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it
It's yours
It's yours

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and

[Verse 2: Drake]
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in, ha!
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, it's yours, it's yours, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, baby, own it, it's yours, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit

If she's bringin' four friends, I know I'll hit at least one (Okay, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt)
Got ’em all tannin' by the pool and they greased up
Police in my city, man, I keep they pockets greased up (Okay)

Ain't nobody makin' too much money off the beef stuff (Okay)

Don't [?] over, I'll be the light
I'll be zonin', I'll be on a [?]
[?] on a [?] on [?] tonight
I want some, don't try me, I'll set this bitch on fire
Told the chauffeur, won't you shut the fuck up and drive?
Told my mama, I don't need your fucking advice
Told my daddy, I would go from over
Since then I have never felt so alive

Help me out
Help me out...
Tell me now
I know, hey, hey, hey
They want to tear me down

Paper thin, paper thin
Writing letters [mumbling] for the class
[?] paper thin, paper thin
[mumbling]...if you ask it be
Paper thin opinions
[mumbling]
Followers, minions
Now let's begin

Paper thin love, you're my love
I tear you down
Aw you're my paper thin love
I write you up just to tear you down
You're my, you're my
Paper thin love
I'm gonna write you up, just to tear you down
You're my, you're my Paper thin love
I'm gonna write you up, to tear you down


Follow the rules of society
First one, constitutionally, prostitutionally
Can't do with me
What are you doing to me
What are we doing to free our mind from the
All the lies and the
[mumbling]
I'm floating I'm swimming
[mumbling]
Who knew that the kid that made Otis
Would lead POTUS and make FLOTUS
[mumbling]
From the bias [?]
Can't deny us [?]

Paper thin love
I write you up just to tear you down
I can't deny you, you're my
Paper thin love
I write you up, to tear you down
You're my paper thin love
I write you up just to tear you down

Extra, extra, extra sauce
[mumbling]
Celebrity prices I pay the extra cost

But I can't even be mad at it
I'm a product of the enviroment
I've been fulfilling the requirements
I'm anything you desire
[mumbling]


You're my paper love
I write it down, gonna tear you down
I can't lie, you're my
Paper thin love
I write you up just to tear you down

You're my
Paper thin love

[Chorus]
Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know, oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back

[Verse]
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women "bitches," but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back, I


[Chorus]
Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know

[Post-Chorus]
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back



[Intro: Moodymann]
Hold on, hold on, fuck that
Fuck that shit
Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute
Fuck that shit
Still on this mothafuckin’ record
I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all
Ayy, y’all get some more drinks goin' on
I'll sound a whole lot better

[Verse 1]
Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won’t mention for now
’Cause we're fallin’ apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can’t blame you, no, no

[Verse 2]
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways

'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even
So don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Ugh! Too many women and not enough time
I'm a cool cat, but I'm on Life Nine
Pimping ain't dead 'cause I be the lifeline
And I don't buy the bar 'cause it don't sell white wine
Go on, let that light shine, balling for a lifetime
Smoking on that nice pine, Weezy baby flight-flying
You can call him your husband, call me at nighttime
And even though women change, I will always like dimes
And yeah, I'm quite fine, but shawty much finer
And I just get behind her and smack it like E. Honda
And please don't hate on me when you see me with Keyana
'Cause she wilder than Nirvana and colder than your honor
Holler at your boy mañana, Maybach come with a recliner
Run up on it and shit will get uglier than an iguana
This is only a reminder, it's Young Money—don't forget it
And I'm Weezy F. Baby, you might find it on her titty
Would you—

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants (Ugh)
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man (Look)


[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
Chilling with my posse, 'bout to call some ladies over (Uh-huh)
Tell them this is YME, so when you come, you can't leave sober (Right)
You would think she came with buttons by the way that I control her (That's right)
Put her on a tab, now she rolling like a baby stroller (Ah)
I’m the freshest niggas seen (Seen), weapon in my jeans (Jeans)
Shoot your lights out, I’m like Redick with the beam (Beam)
Life's a game of chess, and I'm heading for your queen (Uh-huh)
Not my stomach and my thighs, but her head is in between (Eww)
She wetter than a stream (Yeah), I drink medicine to lean (Sipping)
Keep a cup in my hand like I'm begging for some cheese (Haha)
I fall off in the party (Ugh), yeah, I'm kinda tardy (I know)
But if a hater trip, we ride on him like a Harley
Look, you call it "getting married," I call it "acting selfish" (Suckers)
My belt got G's on it like a Packers helmet
And I'ma hit it if you bring your girl around (I promise)
But the weed is like my collar (Why?), 'cause I might just turn it down if you—

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants (Ugh, Gudda)
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man


[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Okay, tool on deck (Deck), I'm newborn fresh (Fresh)
I knock your friends down (Down), and you going next (Ha)
Young—Young Money, fly nigga, all the bitches after me (Chyeah)
Murder in the bed, and you gon' be my next casualty (Ha)
Automatic stick, but I give it to her manually
I'm giving dick out year-round, and you can get it annually
Styrofoam filled with a strawberry Fanta treat
Leaning—I'ma need a kickstand to stay on my feet
Get out my business, like I kicks you out my office
I ain't worried 'bout the price; I'm more concerned with the offer
Fresh to death like I got dressed in a coffin
With a party in my pocket, blue and red dolphins
I'm high as a motherfucker, let me do my thing, bitch
I'm doing me, and your girl doing the same shit
I'm in the car, getting head as I lane-switch
D—Double G: I do my thing, bitch! Now, you could—

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man


[Verse 4: Drake]
Ugh, 'kay, I told you, "Catch up"—did you make a mil' yet?
I can't predict how many of them I can still get
October's Own is such a fucking real set
No tats, but the ink on my money still wet
Life is such a beach; it's sandy all around me
I came here with Young Money, man, that's family all around me
I'm in my living room, and I got Grammys all around me
And famous bitches doing nose candy all around me
Welcome to the life, the life that's meant for me
My Bentley has a tint, and so you got to squint to see
I hollered at your girl; that's when she went with me
But please don't blame yourself, 'cause it just wasn't meant to be
They say I'm one of the illest; that's just off a first impression
And my cards always accepted, I don't deal well with rejection
I look in the dictionary and don't see the word "recession"
I don't smoke in public, but tonight, I'll make an exception, so just—

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, It's 10 O'Clock on a Wednesday and I know your home (Know your home)
Driving up and down your street hoping you that come outside (Come outside)
Cause I just got paid and I'm winning bout to call you on it (Call you on it)
And I just need you to see me, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Charlie says it seems that will make it all better (Better)
Selfish says it is, this just ain’t bout you, no (bout you, no)
Did me wrong every time we were together, gether
So that’s why, I’m gonna stunt on you
I’m gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could have made it all on my own

[Verse 1: Drake]
Treat you like princess
Rest in heaven, Diana
Piquing my interest
She got peak like Montana
England breeds proper girls
Where are all your good manners?
Reply with pleasantries
Honestly, I can't stand ya

[Chorus: Drake]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you thought of me?
Never had me missin' a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap; nowadays, it's free
People are only as tough as their phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me


[Interlude: Stefflon Don]
Bitch been with this boy, yeah, for four weeks
I told her go on a date
All of a sudden, she married
Didn’t say get bloodclaat married

[Chorus: Drake]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you

[Outro: Stefflon Don, Vinessa Douglas & Rhea Kpaka]
— What I'm sayin', in today really at our big, big age if you're gettin' with someone right now and you're linking them for couple weeks, they should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see' so lemme lock off the ting but obviously in the world that we live in today is not like that
— He is… did that — but obviously it takes time— You're chattin' shit. First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning, it should be like honeymoon–
— That's what I said, that's what I said! The beginning is always honeymoon season

— Yeah, well, alright

Verse 1:
I always used to wonder who could live without me
Who I had to prove wrong if they ever doubted me
I pointed the finger when it came to taking the blame
Overtook the blame when I was younger
Wasn’t the same
Life is a game but it’s not
Nurture your seed if not just let it rot
I noticed you can’t have it both ways
I cried in the parking lot to this song after it went wrong and went our separate ways that night
It was real frightening. The house I ran to thought I spited them
I used to want to fight them
I warned them I need to grow and do this for me
This current me is unsightly
I feel off of my bike, fell off of my scooter
Thought she could do better you know I had to boot her
If it wasn’t me it was someone else
I did it for another girl too checking for her health
If I can't sacrifice what is needed for this wealth
The only person can look at that for is myself
I donated plasma with my viable arm
Used to that to tell the girls I’m clean don’t get alarmed
Played clash of clans all day I was trying to farm
What was my cause?
See butterflies flowing in the wind
I know this is what it takes for me to get like that again
All my life knows is sin
Where to even begin?
My beginning is coming after this year
It’s 25, 20/20 no more to get by
It’s time I got mine and get a slice of this pie
It’s not mine to have
To keep I get to manage it
Tired of thinking of suicide or not saying I apologize because it’s part of my pride
I can empathize all I want but if I can’t be the guy
And do it on my own then who the fuck am I?
During this change leave me alone
I am the prize. I’m the lottery ticket
If you’re on the fence about me I’m gonna pick it
Did I lose you, I snoozed you?
Boo hoo’d cause of you?
You ain’t better than me if we’re keeping it true
Gonna out me cause I ain’t talking about religion
I’m spiritual
Make the most out of Hell’s Kitchen
If we don’t get it right we coming back to do it again

Verse 2:
Don’t make this into a trend
I’m not an engineer just waiting on my story to begin
This tape I ain’t doing it for the clout
Wanna get out and stop living in other people’s houses
Don’t trust people till the evidence I’m shown
I said this before on the last tape gotta get gone
More weak than part of a year I gotta get strong
So that I can teach others how to get a long
Stop talking about all the chances I’ve blown
Don’t need these meetings to see that I’ve grown
When God passes me the next throw I’m going long
With my current girl I’m Nia long
It’s never too late didn’t game her just to penetrate
Let me set that straight
Forgive me for what I’m about to say

(Nothing To Me Intro):
This is just my side. My story
I gotta let it go somehow. Ain’t playing the victim
Again, I played my part
Whether I let you take advantage of me or I took advantage of you
We all deal with karma
You get what you put in
Simple as that

Verse 3:
Fuck this fucking bullshit
I told you don’t say you want my body if you don’t know exactly where I’ve been
I ain’t worried about your life I ain’t comparing it
Life was at a low inside the Sheraton
About to join a force that works under a government that doesn’t give a fuck
I’m glad I got stuck at the MEPs taking the physical test
Glad I got my toe fixed was showing distress
I played all of high school with it
Looking like a fool on the bench yeah I was sitting
Couldn’t make a free throw couldn’t make a kick
My grades weren’t good sat out a season didn’t give a shit
I wished more people would care
Who was really aware
Could only accomplish carrying shit up the stairs
Groceries, wish I ate more apples, peaches and pears
Scared of individual development
Improvement, Fuck the bars that society places I gotta do this shit

Verse 4:
You can fight me out of spite get it right
Get a rifle and shoot the dudes that pushed me out of sight
Spit in my face I should have snatched your life
Made fun of me I wasn’t smashing left and right
Hoes getting exposed no cool clothes to mask my sight
I got a laugh up out it
Anyone from school who wanna fight me won’t have a problem
Noticed people stopped fucking with me
Wasn’t concerned what I didn’t earn it was stuck with me
I saw a girl walk out at graduation
I got admiration for her I ain’t have the nuts to do same thing patience was too much for people walking all over me
I’m fucking over it
Not a crutch for you, I’m not a coaster
Not stopping till I’m coasting the coast of Costa Rica
With some pico de Gallo gotta be strict cause I know it’s my go
It’s my goal you know
To be the Stapleton in my den my friend
Stay behind I won’t think less of ya
Coming up and I’m protecting ya

Outro:
Shoutout to Chaz
Been years since we’ve fought and we’ve both had mixed emotions over the years meeting in each other in those stairs
I always wanted to shoot another fair one with you
I realized however you were God’s message to me to humble me after hitting my dad in the mouth
You also set the bar that I was taking no one else’s shit. I thank you for that
I’m glad you’re doing well I heard from Drew you’re first in Track that’s what’s up. It was good seeing you that other day. God bless. Take it easy




Thank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha




[Verse 1]
You say you want me, I don't ignore you

You should come see me on the regular
I don't know if we'll find a better time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been sleepin' with a pistol in my bed
I'd rather have you here instead, I gotta get outta my own head
Don't let me down, come here right now (Yeah)
Don't let me down, come here right now

[Verse 2]
Grow up and face it, don't keep me waiting
You love me how you love me, then just say it
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Girl, what's the hold-up? Come take me over
You came the closest, we should be closer
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been sleepin' with a pistol in my bed

Lyrics from Snippet

[?]
When I get it plenty
Plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty
Shenseea I'm gon' get you like eventu(ally)
Trust me, I’m gonna make you say you love me before I'm loved by you, woman
Slide through, come get this girl you know that we...




[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Look, tell me what you really wanna see
I had the greatest experience shooting that video, 'What’s it Gonna Be?'
I had to say it wowing, my heartbeat started pounding
Walked on the set while she got dressed
In cock rings on her outfit
Janet, why you doing this to me?
At the time I couldn’t believe we both were starring in this movie
You're in my video, you know a nigga loved it
I spent 2.4 million on the fucking budget
All my jewelry flooded, see how the kid was on?
First rap nigga album you’ve ever featured on
And I was weak in the Lord, despite the things we said
My first words to Hype Williams is “I can’t believe this dream”
Shot a solo scene, I tried to make mines better
But I love when we shot together, and we rubbed up on each other
But I’m a little jealous, Tip, your tongue went in her mouth
In that Poetic Justice movie, from what I can account
You know what we be ‘bout…
Any time, huh?
Any place, baby?

Now, you know, at the time, I was really
I really had my crush on shorty, man, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I was in love with shorty since she was
Penny and all that on Good Times and shit, you know what I mean?
Ayo, Kamaal, you’s a fucked up dude for doing that to me, man
You broke my heart with that, man

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Come on, Buss, you know how many dudes say that to me? Like…
(You know you foul)
Once a day, girl, truly
We grew up with her through the lens of a camera
Didn’t have much, but dare said I’m having her
Shorty was the joint, here’s my case and point
Me and ‘Pac rollin’ L’s in the trailer
Both of us get to scheming how to nail her
First movie about to come out in the theater
Pleasure principle, butt to the makeup truck, so ill I gave her my code
We kissed, I took her control, we swapped as all the film rolled
A marathon, we kept this good thing going, sunset, the moon, it came on
In my mind it would prolong
Listen, the scene was deaded, but I wanted my own edit
Me and Justice kissing keep it going, two pros with credit
A memorable summer in ’92 out in Cali
When I got back up top my niggas asked about the fatty
And did I smash her madly, to that I had to answer
Negative, but I’d give anything to be her dancer
A captivating lady, I used to be her baby
Good Times, they never fading
Look back and celebrate Poetic Justice

[Outro: Janet Jackson]
At any time, and any place, I don’t care who’s around
At any time, and any place, I don’t care who’s around
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs


[Produced by Scoop DeVille & Sounwave]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Outro Skit]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"Enough with all this talkin'."
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"



(Verse)
In the thunder and rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Moving up my thigh
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips
I recognize your fragrance, hold up
You ain't never gotta say shit
And I know your taste is
A little bit, mmm high maintenance
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you the flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems and this song’s dedicated to you

(Chorus x2)
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

(Verse)
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty option plain
Cold nights when you curse this thang
You called up your girl when caught up in the ity bity rain
Heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Don’t approach her with that atari
That a good game always sorry
They say conversation ruination
I can tell
But I can’t right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real, alright

(Chorus x2)
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

(Verse)
I really know you play this
‘Cus oh boy you test my patience
With all these subjective photographs
And all these one life vacations
Love is not a verb, you should look it in a mirror
Love is not a verb, if you’re lookin for a maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
Fatal attraction is called, what we have in common is pain

(Chorus x2)
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

Fuck it, let your glasses rise

Ask any ho who know me, all I do is smash and ride
Buckets of bubbly, shake it up and let it splash in the eyes

They see me like “there he go”
Look at you like ” ahh who?”
Bought every bottle at the bar
Shortie you know how I do
I take them all across your noggin', I ain't finna argue
Still big shit popping, nothing changed but my clothes
Triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll
Tell the bitch I take you places where your man can’t go
Can’t be, he ain't doing shit, if he ain't me
Can't you see the difference between us when I walking to the door
Your twenty thousand worth of ones, start letting money go
Let it fly, throw some twenty when my one running low

[Verse 1: Drake]

Yup, it get nasty, then I get gully
Grab the coochie, then the Gucci skully
A whole pack of rubbers, then I burned rubber
You cuddle undercovers, tellin' her you love her

Busy at the crib, cookin' salmon with the lobster
If we talkin' joints, it's just me and David Foster
Bodyguards don't look like Kevin Costner, you tweakin'
Just pulled up to Whitney Houston, Texas for the evenin'
They tell the same story so much, they start to believe it
The ones that start like, "Drizzy's shit was cool, but we even"
Man, how the fuck?
Two, four, six, eight watches, factory, so they appreciate
Crown in my hand and I'm really playin' keep-away
Shit don't even usually get this big without a Bieber face

[Verse 1]
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (Do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum (They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl, let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me

[Verse 2]
They still out to get me, I don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
Give a real nigga the number one
Even though I got like twenty-one
Cannot be me I'm a one-of-one
Schooling your ass like 101
They been out here tryna slide on me
They been out here telling lies on me
Everybody looking out for themself
But they still got they eyes on me
See me putting in the hard work now, ayy
Momma doesn't have to call work now, ayy
I decide when I start work now, ayy
Problems hit the gym, they all work out
MVP, MVP, oh-nine all the way to sixteen
Even next season looking like a breeze
Lot of y'all ain't built for the league, yeah
Trade you off the team while you in your sleep, yeah
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed
And you don't know what you started
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me


[Chorus]
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They like, "Pablo—"
"Why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?"
"Why do you know every single bitch that I know?"
"Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?"
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago
South, south side, that's the motto
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, ayy
Throne is back up in it, ayy
In the field like Emmitt, ayy, y'all get so offended, ayy
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'ma let you finish, but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki (Perfect)

Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)

And you'd owe me change, ah!

Don't stop, pop that, don't stop (I forgot)
Pop that, pop that, pop that (Bounce)
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
What you twerkin' with?
Young Moolah, baby!



[Intro: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah
It's a Habibis ting, ya?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Skrrt skrrt
Quavo, young nigga, I invented you (Ugh)
Ike Turner with the left hand (Ike)
Griselda Blanco with the trap moves (Trappin')
Gangland with the right hand (Gang)
Undertaker with the tattoos (Tats)
Never listen to the class rules (No)
Switch it up, they bit the last move (Let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches (Magnet)
You got the goin' out sad bitches (Sad)
I spent a fifty on the chain (Racks)
You spent your last fifty (Ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets (Keys)
You got the key to defeat (Defeated)
I got the keys to the warzone (Brrapt)
You got the key to the peace (Ugh)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep (Yeah, yeah)
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep (Yeah, yeah)
Gettin' loose (Yeah) off the Henny, 'Roc and a hint of Goose (Yeah)
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool (Yeah, in my pool)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room (Yeah, in my room)
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: "Let's go snorkelin'!" (Yeah)
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs (Yeah)
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play (Kid N' Play)
God, the way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest (Straight up)
I guess for the fuck shit, I'm biased (Yeah)
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my mama out the basement (Mama)
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B up out the bracelets (Yeah, yeah)
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes




[Intro]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all

[Swaggz]
I stack for the future you thinkin’ temporary
I talk about jewels you thinkin’ February
Send who you want and nigga you know I’m ready
Niggas hatin’ they can’t stand the fact I’m getting fetty
Niggas waiting for me to fall and i know this plenty
So i sit back and i relax and i just sip this Henny
And stack my cheese and watch these rats cause they stomachs is empty
Young niggas gettin’ slain all over some skrill
Goes to show you’ll do anything for a dollar bill
Dig a grave get a gun
And a plot to kill
Shit i donno what to say
It costs to be the boss but it pays to weigh
That’s not really you that’s just who you portray
I want money
You want the fame and radio play
Hoppin' out that thing and they makin that radio face
Fat nigga kick back lots of food on my plate
I traded in the pork and beans for a piece of the steak
I ain't tryna look back ain't no foot on the brakes
I think my phone’s wire tapped listen in for the jakes
Fat nigga I’m raising the heat
So the sun is ma son my thinking is deep
You reap what you sow and you sow what you reek
I remember growing up I had holes in my sneaks
Mama sent me two socks it was cold on my feet
Pops barely knew him only see him in pictures
Mom’s a pastor I grew up knowin the scripture
With a ripped shirt on the strip til the nigga got strip searched
The world is mine
I think my name should be Atlas
Makin hits like I leave on the clay for the crouches
My traps pumping your traps as dry as a cactus
I wanna cheat on my girl with a actress
Im tired of hidin that dope under my mattress
Kill it i did it for practice

[KUSH]
I say fuck chasing bitches imma chase my dream
Cash rules everything im loving my CREAM
Money is the object should i get it any means
Got a circle full of soldiers man
Im loving my team
It was all a dream
None like biggy tho
Smoked out my mind but im steady blowin fifties tho
Always on point like I’m standing on my tippy toes
Loyalty is a must but some niggas never get it tho
And that’s the rule that imma live by
Watching for the snakes some niggas be tryna get by
Party hard and you roll blunts and tryna get high
They copy all your swag and fit it in to make em look fly
I really wanna know why
The question still remains
Did I ever spend the money that I managed to have saved
All these bitches wanna fuck me they see money in my veins
And this pressure on my shoulder got me feelin goin insane
But I’m good
I be out grindin while you niggas sleep
I remember days when I was grindin and I ain't never sleep
Posted on the block while I be up and down the fuckin streets
Gotta lot of issues now I'm tearin on the fuckin beat
Lamborghini sit back feelin merciealgo
Table full of models and bottles surround the cop doe
Shawty dancing im throwing hundreds she screaming tato
It's a party a celebration wherever i go
My niggas riding with me
Drunk or tipsy
Bad bitch beside me she's just rolling up a spliffy
Hop up in the whip, hit the clutch, doin sixty
Black interior, black body, Im moving swiftly

[Part 1: Pound Cake, Produced by Boi-1da, Matthew Burnett, and Jordan Evans]

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are


[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em "Less is more, nigga, is plenty of us"


[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel


[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 4: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it," it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg



[Intro]
Yeah, Cash money shit
Cash money shit

[Verse 1]
I can tell that money's got you working
We've been talking for so long
Now we're finally here in person
I taste pain and regret in your sweat
You've been waiting for me, oh-ho
I can tell that you been practicing
I can tell that you been practicing
All those other men were practice, they were practice
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me

[Chorus]
Girl you look good, won't you back that ass up
You a fine motherfucker, won't you back that ass up
Call me big daddy, won't you back that ass up
Girl who is you playing with, back that ass up
You working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah

[Verse 2]
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash yeah, his last yeah
Hoes frown when you passed yeah, they mad yeah
Couple thousand on your bag yeah, fuck yeah
I'm a Big Tymer nigga yeah, money flipper yeah
Get it understood yeah, it's all good yeah
Girl I know it's real 'cause I've been around it
You only want what's real you just never found it
Don't give them no more chances, ooh girl they had their turn
Everything for a reason, there's things you had to learn from them
But when I get you to myself
You know what's going down, what's going down, oh

[Chorus]
Girl you look good, won't you back that ass up
You a fine motherfucker, won't you back that ass up
Call me big daddy, won't you back that ass up
Girl who is you playing with, back that ass up
You working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I know he messed up
But let a real nigga make it right
Let a real nigga make it right, you deserve that much
Let me put something in your life
Let me put something in your life, put something in your life
You telling me it's only been a couple other people that you've been with
I'ma trust you, I'ma give you the benefit of the doubt, and I'ma love you
You can even call me daddy, give you someone to look up to

[Refrain]
All my girls from the 504 need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now
All my girls from the 504 need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now
All my girls from the 504 need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now
All my girls from the 504 need to drop it right now
Need to drop it right now, oh
After you back it up then stop
After you back it up then stop
Babygirl, after you back it up then stop
After you back it up then stop

[Outro]
I can tell that money's got you working
That your body's so wet
And we're finally here in person
I taste pain and regret in your sweat
You've been waiting for me, oh-ho
I can tell that you been practicing
I can tell that you been practicing
All those other men were practice, they were practice
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me

[Intro]

(Woo)
Yeah-

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Now when it come to makin' money, I'm a printing press (Press)
And when it come to bein' trill, I'm the litmus test
Run it like a fitness test (Test)
And when it come to making history, I'm like Joe's son (Son)
A million ways to die and you already chose one (One)
A million dollars stacked, it sounds like a good beginning ('Ginning)
We on the top now
Go back and tell the hood we winning (Winning)
And while you're there, let 'em know I did it just for them (Them)
I made 'em cough the cash up
And left 'em just the phlegm (Phlegm)
Is that the King of the Trill? Go tell 'em, "Yes, it's him" (Him)
And his testosterone is up, who's got the estrogen? ('Gen)
I like your girl and I think she like me even more (More)
I hit her with that heave-and-ho and then I'm leavin' bro (Bro)
The Dirty South's finest, and Dirty South's behind us
Now, that's a plus on the report card, not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your Linus
You got a problem with us? You know just the spot to find us

[Hook: Drake]
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around


[Verse 2: Bun B]
They know I'm in a Port Arthur state of mind
Southern superstar status (Status), I elevate the grind (Grind)
My time is money, so I put some money on my time
Lightning on the Breitling
So exciting when you see the shine (Shine)
We on a level those before us never even thought of (Thought of)
I broke my bread and fed my team just like the Holy Father (Father)
I helped the blind to see and kept it G just like I oughta (Oughta)
The only thing that's left for us to do is walk on water (Water)
We playing all four quarters 'til the clock expire ('Xpire)
So 'til I see the ref waving, I will not retire ('Tire)
My flow is still official, and I still got the fire (Fire)
Can't take your eyes off me (Off me)
Like when you watch The Wire (Wire)
And in oh-ten (Ten), we finna go in (In)
So let the opposition know that there is no win (Win)
And I am no friend (Friend), so put your hand down (Down)
And tell 'em, "Stand down" (Down) before it's "Man down" (Down)

[Hook: Drake]
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down (Yeah, ugh)
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around


[Verse 3: Drake]
Round! I gotta hundred girls in each phone
Drizzy Drake, mayne—Young Sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Homesick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time, every day, we switchin' zones
Drizzy Hendrix, I'm just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later, man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard, nigga; I'm quoted more, nigga
Results are in, I guess you should've voted more, nigga
Swimming in the money, y'all just float ashore, nigga
Never drowning, what the fuck you think this boat is for, nigga?
Yeah, I'm quick to take a R&B diva out
I bring some friends
She bring some friends that know what we about
And when it's done, I put my slippers on and see 'em out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just really tryna keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler, every day I'm riding clean, damn!

[Hook: Drake]
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around



[Couplet 1]
Les mots me viennent doucement comme les souvenirs de ma vie terne où j'encaisse
Petit sera le trou du cimetière mais l'épreuve de la mort sera gigantesque
Je sais que tu te pose des tas de questions, mais Dieu lui seul donne les réponses
Mais seuls les intelligents peuvent en capter les fréquences
Je serai plus qu'un simple auteur interprète qui balance des sons que le public intercept
Me projette rarement vers le futur car en une  secondes tout s'arrête
Je fais rimer la vie de rue d'un DZ pris entre victoire et défaite
Sur le bitume de ma ville une flaque de sang à repeint mes semelles
Mes vieux démons ont suivi ma ce-tra, j'essaie de les semer pour ne pas rouvrir les ppe-tra
Je suis fidèle sur mes positions, mes principes c'est pas le Kâmasûtra
J'estime que mes chances d'y arriver sont quasi nul malgré le chant de mes ultras
Ils aimerais bien nous faire croire à tous que dans nos veines coule le sang des pules-cra
[x] sont fracturés j'peut t l'assurer, parce qu'on vient d'un passé un peu fissurée
J'ai appris à payer cash mes erreurs comme dans une ture-voi pas assurer
On s'affaiblit de jour en jour regardant nos parents vieillir
On à tous plus ou moins croiser l'amour mais rares sont ceux qui ont pu le saisir
Je pourrais te parler des heures de ce qu'il ne va pas, te dire que l'oseille reste le meilleur des appâts, que l'alcool est devenue l'échappatoire quand les p'tits reuf ce mettent des rapta
On les a trop mal aiguiller leur apprenant que l'immoralité les nourrirait, puis le ble-dia leur à tendu la main avec le sourire de Fourniret
Je repense à ça j'ai mal percher dans ma tour de béton à regarder lentement se resserrer l'étau, j'ai trop perdu mon temps à miser sur les [×] , mais que Dieu me pardonne

[Refrain]
On a choisi les mots pour faire parler nos douleur
Armée sur tous les fronts pour faire briller nos couleurs
Ouais mais que Dieu me pardonne
Pourvu que Dieu me pardonne

[Couplet 2]

Je voulais juste faire le bilan de nos vies pour en tirer les conséquences et pouvoir les méditer, même si les cœur sont limités
Mais chaque seconde nous rapproche de la mort tout comme celle de l'humanité
On donne des médailles pour la guerre mais la plus grande des bataille c'est d'arriver à l'éviter
Nos ennemis se ressemble comme frère vu qu'on à tous Eve comme mère
Et dans la poudrière où la flicaille fait des raids meurtrier pendant que les mères pleurent en prière, les juges aime lapider les familles en deuil avec leur cœur en pierre
On est choqué par l'incohérence du monde puis on apprend à s'y habituer, on passe de plaisir en plaisir éphémère vu que le bonheur est dur à se situer
Encore et toujours attiré par les billets, on fait du mal à autrui pour pouvoir mieux s'habiller et si le temps c'est de l'argent on veut ramasser tous les grains de sable du sablier
Tu peux assumer les conséquences de quelques années enfermé, mais sûrement pas la sentence ultime que sera le feu de l'enfer éternel
Ouais je te parle de tout ça j'ai des frissons, je sais que je suis loin d'être prêt pour passer l'audition, quand la course de la richesse va nous buter victime de nos propres ambitions
Tout est flou j'ai du mal à réfléchir comme un reflet dans un miroir encrassé
Je voulais d'une vie pleine de tendresse, mais la vie une garce qui veut pas ce laisser embrasser
Alors j'avance en silence, assumant la portée de mes actes en free-lance
J'ai bouffé la feuille tout seul j'ai pas d'excuse recevable, le jour des comptes faudra finir solvable
J'ai affronter mes pulsions du mieux que j'ai pu mais le [xxx] du haram est têtu
J'ai fait le tri des faux amis à deux balles, quand j'étais mal où étais-tu, hein
J'ai de la haine tah les hooligans, mais plein de gens dans mon cœur comme un polygame
Je veux qu'on se souvienne de moi comme un type bien essayant de faire son devoir pour les siens
Essayer c'est déjà très bien

Mais que Dieu me pardonne




[Intro - Drake]
Yeah
It's Drizzy, baby
You already know what it is
It's the first time—I'm high, it's the first time I smoked in like 3 months
I'm sorry, Mama, I had to do it to 'em
40 I see you
O, I see you, homie
I stayed late tonight, right?
You know what happen when I stay late, haha
Yeah
Boi-1da!
I swear, it's like this every single time
Toronto, I got you
I got us
Yeah

[Verse 1 - Drake]
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, well, I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to, the artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing 'cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth full of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it "playing checkers"
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money, I'll be happy to connect you
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on, where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers all liars and they women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last-Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me, Just write every single thing you need down"
And he got it for me, and I'm as happy can be now
'Bout to start balling like I'm coming off a rebound
Yeah, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack—bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get their swagger right
'Cause I done came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you, pussy-ass hater, you should do you
You ain't heard of me, then you should go and get a Blue's Clue
Oops! I mean a red clue; Wayne's here, suu whoop
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF, but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake, I hate to see 'em so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burning like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And know the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me, but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth? Then pull the zipper down and see
(No homo, though)

[Break: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Um...
I'm going in

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Drizzy, I got us, this is my promise
I'ma bring that barrel to them bitches' eyeliners
And what I make up would fuck up your skin
I pick the buck up and buck-buck, then buck-buck again
I would buttfuck your friend, then suck up her twin
I put the buck up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin
Now, don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo, I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude, always had a black tool
Even when I was at school, 'cause bullies aren't bulletproof
Red scarf, hoodie too, probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker, the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything good as you; no, I do everything better
I get paid for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone, like a dog, motherfucker
I am going for your neck in a sec
Intercept, bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yup, I am headed to the buck
Like, buck-buck again! Might fly to L.A. and just fuck Karrine
Nahh, fuck Karrine! Let's get bucks again
And fucking spend them bucks, and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told you, I'ma do it, I did it
Got my city on my fitted, 'bout to pop it, let's get it
Let's get it, motherfucker, what you waiting on?
It is 'bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted
I'm with it if money is the "it" you want me with
And I probably just spit on the chick you want be with
And I hate a bony bitch, only like 'em only thick
And I own hip-hop; if you don't spit, I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like "Drake Drizzy Rogers"
Or "Drizzy Drake Rogers," I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game, I'm too willing to play harder
So harder, I go, there he go
They chant "MVP" when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jaz, what it do?
The haters on their face and in their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told you, I get paid by the letter, like:
"A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y"
ZZ Top, yes, he rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a footnote; how long can he could go?
Wondering when he stop? Bitch, when the beat stop
So I'ma keep rocking 'til the sheet rock bend
Then, the heat I send burn skin

[Outro: Lil Wayne]

I love rape

[Verse: Drake]
All they do is PR double-E me like I'm Dolph
They say "holy" when they see the chain, that's not a cross
Put the owl on it, you can never take it off

[Chorus: Quavo]
When they see the chain, yeah, they know it’s Ratatouille (yeah)
She say I'm in South Africa I make a movie (yeah)
White McLaren let the wings up and show the Uzi
Drizzy got Baka off with a not guilty

Snippet

[Verse: Drake]
All I do is "Pre", don't leave me like I'm Dolph
This ain’t holy, when they see the chain, it’s not a cross
Put that owl on and you can never take it off

[Chorus: Quavo]
When they see the chain, yeah, they know it’s Ratatouille (yeah)
She say I'm in South Africa I make a movie (yeah)
White McLaren let the wings up and show the Uzi...

[Chorus: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
It's your birthday, baby, it's your birthday
Yeah, who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough
I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, Reese's, don't be ridiculous
Just say your piece and peace up like Ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than Anitta
Bakin', baby, tell me where I need to–

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday

[Chorus: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It's your brrrrrrr–
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control (Oh oh)
It's a celebration, oh oh


[Verse 2: Drake]
They tried it, they went for it
All year and you're still here, just ignore it
If it ain't the real thing, you don't want it
GG, CC's all on ya
It's your month and you know it (And you know it)
And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you
You say, "Play this shit," they better play it (Ayy, play it)
For you (For you), on time
And I miss the days that you was all mine
Haven't been official in a long time
So tell me where I need to–

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday

[Chorus: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It's your brrrrrrr–

It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Oh, it's your fuckin' birthday, oh, oh

[Intro: Drake]
(Sonorous on the beat)
And I know

[Chorus: Drake]
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story, yeah, real bad karma

[Verse 1: Drake]
Condo in Miami, sold that shit to Chalmers
I stay on the beach when I retire
I can't miss a game, I been on fire
I'm thinkin' money when I sleep now
That's the only thing that get me geeked now
Someone got a problem every week now
Oh, now, they talkin' beefs, now
Gotta make peace and stay a hunnid (Stay a hunnid)
All my girls bad, times a hunnid (Times a hunnid)
And I'm going hard, times a hunnid (Times a hunnid)
I'm tryna see a hunnid, times a hunnid
For the guys, for the city and the gang
I might appear if you keep calling on my name
Put a curse up on you, things are getting strange
You ain't lie when you told me that I changed
And I know


[Chorus: Drake]
(Sonorous on the beat)
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story, yeah, real bad karma

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Aye, 2 A.M. with my departure
Jug out to Miami, flew in charter
Stay one hunnid, look at me I've been in charge (Charge)
Oh, you know I'm 'bout to sauce on you (Sauce)
Suggest you lighten up, I might go dark on you (Sauce)
Hey, pull up, pull up, skrt, vallet park on you
Ayy, King Kong, climbing up the charts on you
Oh, goddamn, say my life is full of drama
Hot boy, I feel like Dwayne Michael Carter
(Sononous on the beat)
Life been good since I became a father
Thought you said a kid would make it harder
No-no-no, trust me it just made me smarter
I cut some niggas off, put some real ones on the roster
Never mix the real niggas with the impostors
Keep them niggas far from us, I say, "Fuck 'em all" (I)
I say, "Fuck 'em all"
I just checked all my accounts and my money sittin' tall
Nigga, shut your fuckin' mouth, ain't no need to air you out
Niggas know what you about, heard you goin' through a drought
Must be why you talkin' down
Boy I know


[Chorus: Drake with Bryson Tiller]
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story

[Outro]
(Sonorous on the beat)



Drake :

Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know

[Interlude]
Hope you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back

Lil Mel :

Never on my mind to change
I just stay the same
See my life image is plain
Now addin a frame
Do what I want for me
Overlooking the rest
I just express the truth
And hope for the best
I was taught to be independent
So me standing alone is not really nothing new
Moms told me grow up and make the right variety in life
Now I guess it’s about time I choose
I would love to see the faces of those who tried
Cuz like a new car in highschool  they wantin a ride
But No wasn’t with me then not with me now
I see how money sure make em come around
But for now that’s just a dream I’m just hoping for
I wish could step right into fame like an open door
I hate that it’s my fault women lose connection
But I never chase girls so there no real affection
Family over all I stand by that statement
Success is in the air I inhale the greatness
I tell them liers to get use to my lateness
They need to realize themselves to differ the from fakeness
I hate it
Also im way pass judgement calls
I’m not the one to judge
And neither are you
So don’t tell me what you hear
Tell me what you know
If you paid attention to my lyrics tell me what you owe
If I ask you my name do you even know
And if ya dnt know now ya kno

Lil Mel

How you talked me into sendin' that to you, I'll never know
Fuck it, girl; I'm 'bout whatever though
Yeah, I guess a nigga just believe in you and that's proof for you
Could name a lot of things any other man won't do for you

[Intro]
Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah


[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now


[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven


[Outro]
Yeah
I know

[Intro: Trey Songz]
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement

[Verse 1: Drake & Trey Songz]
Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin' for the good then we got 'em in the trap like, ooh wee
Took 'em from white sneaks to Louis
This metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
Y'all don't really know me if you know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done come all way from the Days Inn
And all the hotels that I stayed in
And I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good
And now I say it's sittin' at amazin'
Girls tryna SoHo lobby us
Hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably us
But I can't blame females
Females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town?
Two or three days, I shut you down
Chilin' with the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince, he rep two up, two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
And I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providin' that
Understand that I'm worldwide, you get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK and from Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans, but, yo, this hook is for my exes


[Hook: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't, now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ain't ya never seen a youngin' so fly? (Probably not)
Lookin' for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life (She gone)
Tryna find another one tonight
And if it's you baby, let yourself be seen
Don't matter skirts, dresses or jeans
I got that work, know what I mean
And I'm flexin' on my ex if you know what I mean

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl


[Verse 3: Drake]
With the other dudes she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and then they break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin'
Lookin' for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO
Sunshine and that heatstroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kellz ain't doin' they thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't , now you don’t
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl


[Outro: Trey Songz]
Let's go

[Intro: Drake]
Ladies and Gentlemen
We are now broadcastin live from London England

[Verse 1: Drake]
Back then it was me plus you, we us two did every single thing that we must do
You trust me, me trust you, plus there's no one else that I see just you
Now a days I'm riding on the bandwagon driver of a porche caiyan wagon
Ice in the necklace light skinned and hectic and all these simple things got a man braggin
And boastin a little never drank much in the past but now they got the kid toastin a little
So cheers to the fact you here in the track you shoulda been shotgun his career in the back
And his two month lease expires right now knew I shoulda got me a truck with two front seats I assume it's
Done I'm lookin at my passenger side I realize that there's room for one oh

[Chorus: Voyce]
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

[Verse 2: Drake]
Now a days you be all cried out no more tears no more planes cause you all flyed out
Need the lord in your life on a Sunday no more fashion nomore spendin your life on the runway
Deal with it you hardly can all this hype around Drake whatever happened to Aubrey Graham
Well it's her he’s needin you gotta say leave in the word but I know leavin has crossed your mind
You jealous of some autographs I often sign I try to make it to dinner never often time
But I often find myself hearin your voice you said you never felt a touch soft as mine
I was sayin how the range and the loft is mine had to change in the planes and the porche is mine
It's a deal I was forced to sign but I never imagined that youd end up fourth in line no


[Verse 3: Voyce]
Shes got a feelin lonely (feelin lonely)
Like she don't even know me (don't even know me)
I thought that she would be the one for me but now I see that
If I could turn back the hands of time she would be mine
You’re on my mind girl let's rewind it back
[Bridge: Drake]
Look this for that girl that you use to see for anybody that want it how it use
To be all the love afection and all the cash I wanna rewind but we movin forward fast

[Chorus: Voyce]
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

[Verse 4: Drake]
And I adore all the pictures that everyone in the media is dyin for
Back when there was one camera to smile for
There was only couple things I could buy you compared to now where I'm kinda like heres a thou
Drop grands through appear in style but I could still be chillin in sweat pants and a stainless ring
Without you I havnt gained a thing oh


[Chorus: Voyce]
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright

[Verse 1: Drake]
Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man, woo!


[Refrain: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly!
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (Switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh, listen, you hear that?


[Refrain: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Intro]
Kane is in the building

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first


[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here and it's things you gotta go through
Just know that Tha 3, it don't love you like I do, and it never will

[Verse 1]
Yea it never will
For you? Im forever real
You could tell me everything that you got locked away, girl i'd never tell
Its confidential, l'll keep it to myself
And I swear, that's a swear
Right hand to the big man
Slim chance of me tellin' like a stick man
Girl, on life that's the truth
I'll do anything you want me to

[Chorus]
Cause you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here and it's things you gotta go through
Just know that Tha 3, it don't love you like I do, and it never will

[Verse 2]
Can tell me what's the drill
Is everything on you real?
I'm talkin' hair and them nails
Breasts and that derriere
Cause if it is that ain't fair
Other women can't compare baby
I wanna netflix & chill
And i meanin' that forreal
So what's up with that what's up
You the sickest like you stuffed up
I hate you're cuffed up
If i get you, i den lucked up
You got my interest
Baby girl for you i got time and inches
We talk like you ain't gotta man, we got dementia
Also I forgot to mention


[Chorus]
Baby girl, you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here and it's things you gotta go through
Just know that Tha 3, it don't love you like I do, and it never will

[Verse 3]
Yeah it never will, it will never
You know the game, no one plays it better
You never compromise or go below your standards
You independent baby girl you got it all together
See you ain't perfect but you close
Walk by in a dress and they necks on broke
You can be big as Rihanna you bad as Rihanna
I know I said that before but it's still true
Yeah baby girl you're a star to me, you're art to me
I swear I want you all to me
Make my hotline bling, make a call to me
So I can tell you what you are to me

[Chorus]
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here and it's things you gotta go through
Just know that Tha 3, it don't love you like I do, and it never will



[Hook]
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

[Verse 1]
But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like oh well
You're like, "Fuck it. Oh well"
My past behind me like a pony tail

[Hook]
But you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

[Verse 2]
Okay I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more Henny and you're past the limit
You told me 'bout the picture, now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

[Hook]
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

Baby, I'm here

Lost in your eyes every time that you look in mine
Promise to be all that you need

I will never ever put nobody up above you
I just wanna kiss you, baby
I just wanna hug you 'til the end, baby, 'til the end

[Verse 2: Drake]
Say you'll be mine, say we'll be fine, say we'll be together
Selfish of me to ask, since I be the reason we don't last forever
Wished that you knew all that I do to make this thing go right
Promise to be all that you need

[Intro]
[?]

[Chorus: Drake]
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together moving
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)

[Verse 1: Von Pea]
Yo, what i gotta do to get you pussy cat dogs
To not, act hard like I wouldn't jab y'all
You a trap-star, cool i'm a dream catcher
You from New York, stop biting off Atlanta
Pea is a rap terrorist, suicide bomber
I'ma blow up me and everybody around me
You can't show up pea im everywhere you try to be
Here's some advice get nice and don't lie to me
In my last 6 I trumped your whole shiznik
Son I've heard better MC'ing in limp bizkit
Rappers is rugrats, I am DR. Lipschitz
Come to ya shows theres enough space to park with
Wheres your fanbase, with so much damn grace
I plan your demise over eggs and pancakes
First thought of the day the second one goes
I won't stop until I see TM blow


[Verse 2: T.Dot]
[?]

[Verse 3: Drake]
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus

[Chorus: Drake]
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)


[Verse 4: Drake]
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise



[Chorus: Rita Ora]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, she's over
I decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah & Rita Ora]
Uh, sexy señorita, I feel your aura
Jump out that fucking motor
Get in my flying saucer
I make you call me daddy even though you ain't my daughter
Baby, I ain't talkin' books when I say that I can take you across the borders
I'm young and free, I'm London G
I'm tongue in cheek, so baby, gimme some tonic drink
Slow and steady for me go on like a jezzy for me
And say the word as soon as your ready for me
I’m ready for ya

[Verse 2: Rita Ora]
Hit ‘em all, switch it up
Put 'em on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater
You say you’ll be here soon, sooner the better
No option for her, you sayin’ no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, whatchu waitin’ for?
Thought it over and decided tonight is your night

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you feel my heart is beating?

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, she’s over (I, I, I'm ready for ya)
I decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer (I, I, I'm ready for ya)

[Verse 2: Rita Ora]
Nothin’ on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you’d be able to handle me
Mental picture, no cameras please

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you feel my heart is beating?

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, she’s over (I, I, I'm ready for ya)
I decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer
(I, I, I'm ready for ya)

[Bridge: Rita Ora]
Yeah, I hear you talkin'
Don't know who your tryna flatter
Got my mind made up
I-I-I'm ready for ya'
I'm in control, but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand
I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
So keep thinking you the man 'cause it's all part of my plan
I-I-I'm ready for ya

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you feel my heart is beating?

[Outro: Rita Ora]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over




[Chorus: Rita Ora & Drake]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, she's over
I decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer
I, I, I'm ready for ya

[Verse 1: Drake]
Red lipstick on a wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you want it fast? Define fast
'Cause I could speed it up and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed

[Verse 2: Rita Ora]
Hit 'em all, switch it up
Put 'em on, zip it up
Let my perfume soak into your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No option for her, you sayin' no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, whatchu waitin' for?

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you feel my heart is beating

[Chorus: Rita Ora & Drake]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, she's over
I, I, I'm ready for ya
I decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer
I, I, I'm ready for ya

[Verse 3: Drake]
I'm ready, I'm with it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well, I'm packed, too
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you, bang
The baddest woman ever and the hardest out
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money to the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready, too
Hope it's somethin' that you thought about
(I, I, I'm ready for ya)

[Verse 4: Rita Ora & Drake]
Nothin' on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'd be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Can you feel, my heart is beating
Can you feel, my heart is beating

[Chorus: Rita Ora & Drake]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, she's over
I, I, I'm ready for ya
I decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer
I, I, I'm ready for ya

[Bridge: Rita Ora & Drake]
Yeah, I hear you talkin'
Don't know who you trying to flatter
Got my mind made up
I, I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control, but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand
I, I, I'm ready for ya
I, I, I'm ready for ya
I, I, I'm ready for ya
So keep thinkin' you the man cause it's all part of my plan
I, I, I'm ready for ya

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you feel my heart is beating

[Partial Chorus: Rita Ora]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over




Who’s Your Road Runner))))
I’m That, Dark Scales, Big Sales Low Stacks
Coke Prices Running Up Like That, Dope BOYZ Getting Smoke Like That [Hook] Only




[Intro: Organik]
We're going to jump right into the battle. All the way from Philadelphia, rapper to my right, introduce yourself

[Rone]
Man, you seen me in the fucking streets. You seen me in the ring. Rone Baby The Prince Soon To Be The King.Let's fucking go baby!Let's fucking go

[Organik]
All the way from Chicago, making his Toronto debut, battler to my left, introduce yourself

[Big T]
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck! Let's go. Y'all ready?

[Organik]
Yeah. Rone won the coin toss, Big T let's get it

[Round 1: Big T]
Big Terrance!
I never seen 'em say "Adam" and make the crowd large
See I didn't ask for this
Organik picked, that's a wild card
Just send me a couple thou' large and he a dead man, how smart?
You get Terrance and Phillip fo' sho(w) in Canada like South Park
Now start
Ain't you from Grind Time New York?
Now don't nobody even see you in a battle
I get money in the garden, I don't think Adam even eating in The Apple
Garden, Adam, Eve and Eden and the apple?
That's the only time y'all gonna hear me repeating in this battle
I run up on him with Glock ah...
I can't do that type style
I touch that nigga whipping the ra...
Not in this King Of The Dot crowd
Fuck that
Shalock, boom boom, blocka, blocka, BOW!
I came in this game making Glock sounds and I ain't gonna stop now!
Y'all got Mr. Chickalaboo back in Canada
I'm Mr. Psss Ting/poutine, silencer on it, TING! Dllalat dat doo get
1 in cannon I use routines
That was a reach but I'm reaching for two things when I'm shooting
Dumping it
Switch it up like a mood ring during a mood swing, you king?
You king?
I heard you was selling coke in college to all with your rich white friends
Shit, I walk up to you like, "Hi guys." Giving hi fives, I'll fit right in
Learning all of they connections on how they sneak white in
Then come to/two body they connects like Siamese twins
Friends?
What could this guy do?
This guy is food
All I need is the laces on my shoe
One call, pa-poo
All you hear is "ahh ooh"
I make a call and Tyrone/tie Rone up like Erykah Badu
You better call Tyrone
Cause the respirator gonna look like you telling the truth on the operator
Flatline
When I stop doing gun sounds?
Unlikely, never
He good...but you better hope the doctors better
Cause I'ma give him the toast, they taking Patronshots together
Get at 'em/Adam for the people I sent at 'em to get Adam
I'm breaking Adam/atom down until Adam is broken down into atoms
Like, where your kids Adam?
I'm sick Adam
I'll have my dogs sic Adam
You know why Pat used to bitch Adam?
Cause he started his Facebook page and he didn't add him
Like...forget Adam, don't Facebook, call or Tweet at him
I'll beat the shit out him, I'll point that M at 'em
Now get ma'dam, I don't if I was Eve
I'm stepping back from the plate like they throwing a pitch at 'em
Point the sig at 'em, remove his ribs out 'em
Like God did Adam!
What you want?
Syllable rhymes?
Man the simple it's fun
That's easy like a Christian or nun reading a scripture or songs
There's two pistols on me, boom, boom, empty the gun
The other one I raise without a care like an illegitimate son
Didn't you say, "Black people don't raise they children?"
You racist Nazi fag
Guess what, I was raised by my mom and dad
Like, I'm cool with black people
That's until they driving fast get off in traffic and call 'em a "nigga" when they driving past
When Daylyt was doing that Pat Stay, whipping the weirdest shit
You and 24/7 was the only people cheering and shit
Shit, cheers and shit
Slapping beers and shit
Like that's the best Daylyt we seen all year and shit
TIME!

[Round 1: Rone]
So Organik hit my phone up!
About this battle with T
Well he Facebook messaged me and I texted him and he told me to call
You know...international fees
But Organik hit my phone up!
I was taking orders and blazing quarters, he said, "How 'bout T?"
I said, "He's outdated as a tape recorder"
I said, "What about Pat? What about Shots?
I exhausted a lengthy order
Then I said, "All right T then" I was sounding like Ace Ventura
So I took...T...on
Flipped the switch and then tee...off
Like tee ball or a tee box, you a Scrub go ask T-Boz
Oh that's the T?
The audacity
Brutality
Calamity
You'll get all that from me
Royce? 50? They could go H.A.M. with me
I got a profanity for any pro fan of T
Your girl don't engage in honesty
If she say the only man that she on is T
So you need some friendship, some humanity
But you look like a sea creature, you manatee
They doubted I could pass a T
Like I don't have the capacity
But you'll get stretched like a legra tee
And I could do that with alacrity
This shit gon' be a travesty
When I kill your ass in front of Travis, T
So bring half of your team or relax against me
And that's a sure fire way to make a casualty
So I heard you almost got signed to Shady Records
Their whole staff been partial
So you flipped out on your Chicago shit
Like, "What you gonna do for my brand then Marshall?"
So they skipped him cause guys rowdy
Now I'm collecting my bounty
I'm from Philly but I run this show in Toronto, I'm Kyle Lowry
But you second in your city Terry
That's why they call you Pippen, Terry
And to say you don't get women Terry
That don't take a visionary
I mean, we could find a Mormon tourist in Europe and you still couldn't hit it missionary
No one wants to see your Bear/bare ass
That's exactly why you single Terry/Singletary
But if beef...what you're facing Terry
You'll get rocked like a mason Terry (Masonary)
And if they wind up chasing Terry
He gon' Jet like he Jason Terry
But I could keep it on Chicago shit
Like where Urlacher played
We could think, Sammy Sosa, a sosa who packed his 'cane
Or I could him on ice faster than Patrick Kane
Then grab some more rice [?] that are in Patrick's chain
You got no H for jabbing veins
You ain't slinging crack cocaine
You ain't seen a brick or a nic' since Patrick played
You ain't have Blue Magic since Magic contracted AIDS
You wouldn't draw on me if I was half a page of anime
You wouldn't draw on me if I was a connect the dots handout
You wouldn't draw on me if I was passed out in a frat house
I mean...
You have an imprint in your fat from the weapon on your waist
When you smile, it looks like your lips are being stretched across your face
You fucked up on Total Slaughter because of the glares of everyone there
Let me guess, it wasn't the first time you couldn't take the stares/stairs
And when I heard you got shot...I got jealousssssss
I mean, I'm glad you're not out on the streets dead
But if I got popped with a couple shots it would do wonders for my street cred'
I mean, who knew the Michelin Man was from Michigan Ave?
Too tired to walk, too fat to sit in the cab
And this is dinner for me
To you dinner's a snack
You got me G? Colostomy, I got this shit in the bag
Bro, after these fireworks, he'll be calling up life alert
Getting a ride to church, reading his favorite Bible verse
His wife will squirt and then leave him after I make him bite the curb
He'll get a career and have to wear a Hawaiian shirt and tie to work
And the boss at his new office
I bet he, ain't gon' fuck around
So you'll have to change your name from Big T to Big Button Down
And what kind of future is that?
What kind of lose is that?
When you're forever known as "The dudes who's fat who used to rap."
Quiet, let's go bitch

[Round 2: Big T]
{Big T snoring}
I fell asleep in my last round
It felt like I was in the camel clutch
Where Drake at?
Cause I'd a ask him, I didn't hear it but, did he land a punch?
My bad, I'm just saying that I'm being real with him
I don't got that feel with him like Lil' Wayne...Baby
If it wasn't for that Cash Money I wouldn't want to deal with him
That long round but I'm still winning
I put your face on the ground
I send you to a land of angels, halos and clouds
Oh, everybody in shotgun think it's a game
Until now I get mad and intercept a bullet
That's when the whole game turn around
Welcome me back
But I'm at the King Of The Dot pissing on welcoming mats
Aye, what's your obsession with battling black rappers from Smack?
Like it's suppose to help you progress up in rap
You say "black people don't raise their children."
You saying it's a fact
But another fact is that battle with Pat was gay as fuck
And ain't no questioning that
I teach you How To Be A Player, where Bill Bellamy at?
I'm sexy and fat
Yo, why you and Pat keep texting me that?
Bullets invest in a Mac, fuck loading a clip
It's like I could load a jet ski in that
Wayne Gretsky is back
Slide on this bitch like I'm trying strike a match
But she never wipe her snatch
Her puss smell like something crawled up and died in that
Thank God I'm back
Battle rap crisis back, beat me?
It's like women's rights activists signing a petition to make Ray Rice come back
I'm nice at that
And I pull up to the light it seems
Go 'head you want to fight but I don't do the Tyson thing
I'd rather pull up in a whip, FIRING
All you see is that bitch, pop out a TV like The Ring
Style on 'em
You see T at Penn State with a fifth of Jaegermeister
Half pint of drank provider
From one of Drake's suppliers
Snoop Dogg vaporizers
Spray this guy and have a K hole tranquilizer
Before they announce that pussy with a W and I ain't imitating Plies
You ain't as nice as mine
Trying to rhyme in this column and I'm like Columbine
A life's demise
Everybody you like were guys
I still got the steel on the side like Johnny 5
Two nine's on me Mike and Live on 99
Don't style in this
I'll beat your Mobb Deep underground, Alchemist
This trigger finger?
It start developing callus
It don't work out/workout, paralysis
If he move it's miraculous
Clips? I load a spear in it, Goldberg tackle us
We're savages, blood drinking Draculas
I bet your idea of an Ebola vaccine is
"America need to stop letting those damn Africans"
You want cold war?
I'm a cold war practition- quiet!

[Round 2: Rone]
That was a cool little round bro
Really I'm not that mad at you
...mad at cha
At the beginning of the round you were snoring
That's called sneep apnea
(Sleep apena
I gotta learn how to talk)
Fuck spitting for a civil war I'm dicking up your chicken raw
I'm longer than the pinafore and stronger than a Minotaur
What you want friction for?
I'm savage as the Chickasaw
He gonna show where them cans is/Kansas?
It's a road trip to Wichita
If you got the heart for this, a double dose of Lipitor
If you on the block then it's Madden with the Brickasaw
And I ain't talking Ferguson and I ain't popping shots
So what you mad at me for dawg? Man I'm not the cops
But I can play the judge for this irrelevant geek
Cause if Eric Gardner chokes you won't hear a sentence from me
I mean...
I'd love to kill him on a beautiful Sunday like today
Caskets up with the bouquet
Or maybe get him on the next day, have him stuffed in a suitcase
And if I can't get him then, I give a fuck what your dude's say
He'll be just like Makonnen going up on a Tuesday
I'm fucking...
You souffle soft, I'll fillet you for loose change, you're too gay
Fucking get booked, you would sing off keys, that's fucking Robert Goulet
I'm Bobby Boucher
Packing a hatchet the Sioux made
I'll fucking scalp 'em and sell them dreads as a fucking toupee
What to do with this nerd?
Takes an unusual verse
How to befuddle a spitter who makes music with words
But I'm from Philly, you know I fuck with the root of the...
The fucking word of The Roots
But today I think I kill him with the root of the words
See I've never been im-pressed
It's nothing I'll im-ply
My raps make him in-vest
You barely get in-vites, I don't say it in jest
I'll still put you in flight
You're the shit that they ig-nore
My shit make 'em ig-nite dawg
If you in court you raising your in-dex
If you in deep you probably gon' in-dite
Only whore on-line you spinning on Pintrest
You never been a gangster who's cutting them pin stripes
But when I spit my shit it's cleaner than Win-dex
But he can't even [?] cause his chunky ass wind pipe
So I don't give a fuck if he out from the mid-west
His delivery is as gentle as a fucking midwife
Bro I can't even hang with T cause son's stressing
He thinks everything is a drug or a gun reference
Like I said, "Molly, Miley and Nina's in the back of the whip."
He said, "Pills, coke and a nine?" I said, "No. Actual chicks."
If I say "Crystal and Mary Jane" he ain't thinking names of women
If I fucking talk about my cell plan
He's thinking about escapes from prison
Listen
If I say "ratchets" I'm talking about tools
If I say "cans" I'm talking about booze
If I'm gon' ride it's probably a cruise
If I got white it's the sock in my shoes
But you acting like your squads snapping
You all wood like a log cabin
And that big arm like Tom Savage
But my strategy is John Madden
You got sound effects in your rounds well then homie you should stop rapping
We in Toronto, Capo, leave it to Scott Jackson
But I mean...
But, but me and T...fucking...
Did brawl once the fucking sound effects were crazy
We fucking went all out it was right in front of his lady
I mean he came out with that chic chic trying to let that big thing ring
But I came back with the sword I was like shwing shwing shwing

[Round 3: Big T]
Uno Lavos wouldn't cross the boarder to get work from you and he Mexican, that's messed up
J.C. wouldn't dance in the ring with you
E.Ness wouldn't give the Bandz up
So you saying stuff like, "Why these black people wanna battle me?"
Man shut the hell up
You like Brad Pitt in Fight Club
They got you out here looking crazy beating yourself up
Help us?
What happened when [?] at your dome?
It was your black friends buddy that stood up like, "Leave that kid alone!"
See, you didn't care if our dads weren't at home
Their loyalty was like your real name
If needed them fam to get 'em/Adam for Rone
Damn wigger
You lying in your voice
You playing Simba
Your N.W.A. CD skip last night at the hotel and I heard you saying "nigga"
I heard you, you was saying "nigga"
Scalp you with a scalpel, approach me and I'm spraying ya
Have Adam's apple surgically removed like a transgender
You a puss homes
That battle with Pay Stay wasn't gay, it just look wrong
Like, are y'all fucking for real?
No, are y'all fucking for real?
He had you took home
You talking loud, that silencer on that {chic chic} clone
Without tux, you finally get a tie or two to match
When I go at Pat Stay and Rone it's on
It's time to stop the show
Breaking news
I knew you was going to come with the typical practical jokes
April Fools
I'm spraying tools the rules that the Navy use
But this ain't what it's taking to
You gonna come to get popped, Taken 2
Save the ooohs
This round, I take the boos
I'm playing in school like oooh, "he got them new Jordan 2s? Let's take his shoes."
We got older, put mother and daughter in a sacred room
One live, one die nigga, make 'em choose!
Fuck it, kill yourself for all I know
I point that can' at her, that big boy is Ontario
But there ain't no where to run though
Now that was a reach, I ain't gon' lie
But I'm reaching for another gun pronto
Drake Started From The Bottom beat, you gon' get it from Mahalo (a hollow)
See, we all know a whole bunch of shit that you could say about me
If I was you, I'd have all my shit took away
You could say
"Big T, what you know about studying for a test that's a month away?
You had to go to school, your dad made you read a book a day
The whole book a day
No B's, you only could get A's
Cause if you didn't get good grades you got all your privileges took away."
You could be like, "Big T
What you know about being mad when McNabb couldn't play
Cause if it was a mistake my dad used to beat my mom ass and I had to look away."
Like, "He didn't mean to fumble that last play it was a mistake."
All you hear is {bbbbbrrr bbbbrrr clap clap} "Leave her alone dad for goodness sakes!"
What you know about Adam having the same face as mine
Cause I'm Adam junior and he's Adam senior he had the same face as mine
So if I lose the disgrace is mine
So first place was mine cause you had somebody there to motivate you every time
I wouldn't know about that
QUIET nigga!

[Verse 3: Rone]
Yo check
So I worried they'd paint me simply
If fat jokes were all I'd bring for T
But he's the first really fat guy I've battled so...this is big for me
I mean, these fat jokes are mad heavy
Y'all might get mad at me
Shit, I might lose all my fat friends, oh wait I don't have any
So if regular fat people wear big tees with their bathing suits
You take the next level and probably bathe in suits
I mean I'd clown him about his outfit but his face looks like it's drowning
You don't have a lazy eye you have a lazy face around it
You look like the Teflon Don if he was covered in Teflon
Or a walrus who dipped all of his blubber in Exxon
Fuck a bug, he's killed any mammal he's stepped on
If Biggie saw this piggy he would think he was Dead Wrong
I mean as far as food, what we got today?
Lobster face? Pasta plate?
He's black and Islamic, what the fuck is he? A chocolate shake/sheik
I mean, you're too fat to walk over subway grates
But you're in the hall of fame with Jared as the Subway Greats
I mean, fucking your blood pressure is higher than the price of a brick
You are addicted to steaks if we're talking life on the strip
We would need a whole tray to put ice on your wrist
And your fingers are too fat so you fucking type with a stick
But fuck jokes, I'll use reality to show that they're lame
(REAL NIGGA SHIT!)
The joke would be you probably need two seats whenever you sit on an airplane
The reality would be if you sat next to on me an airplane it wouldn't ruin my night
It wouldn't ruin my flight
It would ruin my life!
Him coming down the aisle with hard steps and short breath "Please God do not let him sit here" I'd be praying with palms clenched
Sit down and your drenched from your breast to your forehead Fuck two seats, lard fest could only fit on a park bench
In case of emergency landing he'd need an extra large vest
If he has the window seat, the sun's eclipsed by your chest
And I'd be hard-pressed to stay Meta like Artest
Because this guy can't keep his side fat off of the armrest
I mean...
I mean it's a tight nice little package but I promise all that's real
You are inconvenient to be around, how awful does that feel?
I mean...
I mean his gains could be alleviated
And his pains could be abbreviated
With a diet and exercise maybe tying to be creative
It's really basic but the only time he's creative
Is making tacos with ice cream as a freaking meat replacement
He's got a million ways to sweeten cakes
But not one way to lean his face in?
Always room for cheese and bacon
But let me guess, the greens were taken?
But people treat it like it's a disease a sickness to be mediated
Misleading statements from the media they deviate it
Like "it's fat shame" and I can't take it
I'm trying to decrease your weight and that benefits you
So you could show some appreciation
I mean that fact that you're fat
Says so much about you as a man
No long term goals, no perseverance, you can't stick to a plan
You only care about yourself, you're stuck in your selfish ways
And none of your family members care enough about you to help you change
But they say, "Big T's the man" like that'll help him magically
Oh course you're the man dawg, you motherfucking have to be
You have to be cool or funny just to get an advantage
Otherwise you wouldn't have a single friend on this planet
I mean, I mean, fucking...
Fat people make less money, they get promoted less
They're more likely to be alone or suffer an early death
And I get pissed cause you have kids and your children are gonna grow
And it's a tragedy cause being fat is all that they'll ever know
When your daughter was born you probably weighed 355 pounds
If you walked a mile a day since then, he'd be skinny by now
So I don't give a fuck if I lose today or fucking lose the race
Bro you can't win at life until you fucking lose the weight bro




[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it (Drop it down and just)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the Twerk Team
Hair long, ass fat, shawty mean
That girl look like Halle Berry when I'm on them beans
When I hit the scene girls yelling and they scream
"Flocka can you be my baby daddy?" (Yes!)
Pimping like I'm Dolemite, hoes jump in my Caddy
Smoke like I got cataract in the strip club throwing up them stacks
Got racks on top of racks
Bust that pussy, make that ass clap, clap, clap
I ain't done with you, baby bring that ass back
Still got 20's, still got 50's, even got them hundreds
Throw some money, throw some money I'mma let it go
Waka Flocka Flame, better known as Mr. Let It Go

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it (Drop it down and just)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Bust it like you can't afford a car
You a star, you look in the mirror, you know who you are, right?
Cool, take it low, take it way lower than that
I fly private when I go, ain't no layover on that
Yeah I made it to the top, took a seat, still sitting man
I'm up in Stadium in D.C. still tipping man
She coulda paid tuition five times, still stripping
I just throw a couple bills, and she'll have a pair of heels
Oh no, there I go, magic tricking on your ass
Throwing every president except for Nixon on your ass
Make you rich, I feel like I should make commission on your ass
Wonder what you would ever do if I went missing on your ass

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it (Drop it down and just)

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Throwin' them stacks, OMG
SMH when I'm on that stage
Pourin' Rosé all on her ass, a round of appeal baby pop that pussy
Drop it down for me girl do a split, do you smoke girl? Gotta zip
White Rémy Martin, who wanna sip? 45 on my hip
But I gain one deep and every word I say is slurrin'
Vision, man is blurrin', drunk too much liquor
Smoke too much weed, bitch I'm on too much E
I'm so high, y'all will miss me
In love with strip clubs, shorty I'm a big tipper
Two hundred then I pull down my zipper, ughh
Shawty say she want me and she wanna meet my crew, Squad
Niggas know we go hard, Squad

[Alt. Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the Twerk Team
Bust it, bust it, like the Twerk Team
Bust it, bust it, like the twerk team
Bricksquad monopoly, shorty that's my home team
All the smokers they gangsta green, can't do no G talk
I need a classy girl in the bed, she ain't gotta be a freak ho
Bust it, bust it, lay down on that floor girl
Bust it, bust it, give me some more head girl

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it (Drop it down and just)




Hey there material girl
The neighbors told me that you're moving out
Leaving to witness the world
But are you sure that's what you're doing now

Are you running away for a purpose
Do you even know what your self worth is
The passport you carry in your purse is
The gift in the curse when you going head first is
The ATL, MIA, LAX, JFK
Luggage all packed and to them I say
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray

You wander the world
You seek what you've lost
You're waking up every day
The run away, run away girl
I turn and your gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
The run away, the run away girl

So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on
Your way
Run away girl
(x2)

Watching it all through the window
And wishing you could make it shatter now
Now that you're here on the other side
Are you sure it even matters

Are you living the dream
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems
Do you strip do you model do you live in between
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like

You wander the world
You seek what you lost
You're waking up every day
To run away, run away girl
I turn and you're gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
You run away, run away girl

So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on your way
Run away girl
(x2)


[Verse 1:  Drake]
Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, "I know you need a break."
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—


[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, "Thanks for givin' to me," like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like “tha Carter”, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard
"Pretty Girls Like Trap Music" so I woke up with my wood hard


[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I was stealin' from a bitch (slime)
Back when I was 21 (facts)
My favorite gun was a SIG (nine)
20 in the clip, head one (no cockin')
Growin' up, I was a running back
You never made me ran once (goddamn)
I got shot, sweat started runnin'
That shit was red like Heinz (ketchup)
I'm kickin', pimpin' like I punt (beat it)
But don't you think shit's sweet?
I'm talkin' sweet, deer meat (ooh)
I'm talkin' suite like he sleep (like he sleep)
We ain't doin' too much talkin' (nah)
I'm talmbout talkin' like a speech (election)
Like the President, I kill 'em neat (scammers)
I’m talkin' neat like freak
I'm talkin' neat like fleek
I'm talkin' neat like a geek (yeah!)
You come with beef, I eat a B
I'm talkin' B’s, spellin' bee (sheesh)
Double R, that's a Rolls
Paint it yellow like it's dairy
I'm talkin' Rose like Derrick
I'm talkin' rolls like a belly (woo)
Like a new car, I got two keys
Tryna score the bucket like a Chevy seat (Chevy seat)
Then I heard they been pullin' all week (all week)
I'ma use your name like, "Who is he?"
You get it? Haha!
I said I'ma use a name like, "Who is he?"
Got some gold on, leprechaun, sheesh
Deep sleep short for deceased
Big bezel on the Patty (woo)
I’m talkin' PADI—I meant Patek
Don't try to take it, I got guns
I'm talkin' guns, not pellets (pellet)
I watch the game from the floor (floor seats)
I'm talkin' wood, first mattress
I'm talkin' wood, pants down (pants down)
I'm talkin' woods like them clowns (you get it?)
I got my mink off a monkey
I'm talkin' monkey like Jumanji (hrr)
All your diamonds partly sunny
I'm talkin' sunny like D, Sunny (Sunny Delight)
My diamonds wet, it cost me money
I'm talkin' wet like it's runnin' (sink)
I'm talkin' wet like Katrina (New Orleans)
I'm talkin' wet like Dasani, huh


[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

[Intro]
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

[Chorus]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever maynе, ever mayne, еver mayne
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
(x2)

I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne (x3)

[Verse: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches


[Chorus]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne (x3)

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last


[Outro]
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne



[Verse 1]
Can I, can I save you from you?
'Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you've been sippin's not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, yeah
'Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making a mistake I never learned from

[Hook]
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you

[Verse 2]
'Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, 'cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

[Hook]
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you

[Verse 3]
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playing you just drunk. You just saying shit
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
'Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes and I'm just trying to correct it
And I fall...

[Hook]
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you


[Intro]
Uh, Versace remix you already know, whats good

[Verse: Samer Khalil]
Leaving my past behind, future aside, present alive
Uh, rolling with my caravan, no frenchies no comment ca va
Pushin`niggas off the top, too much pot, I should open up a shop
Rocking Louis jeans, belt Armani and Versace top
Smoking on that green, making that green all with the team
Hustling streets, they keeping it quiet like they ain't seen no fucking thing
We all toking up, been thinking plots and just chasing dreams
Keeping it real, everyday blowing offs of steam
Pulling up with rings, rolling up like kings
Coming up like a storm hit, haters hate cause we porsching
In the studio recording, doing it like it's important
Versace game we join it, top of the game we force it
Versace everything, believe in it like Peter Pan
Some things you just can't stand, cause it ain't planned and you late fam
They get reeled in, with no bands and they buy grams and they proud of them
How you stand your ground when you've got no ground to stand?
What's a peasant to a king
You don't get this, mother fucking Versace on his hit list
Foreign cars fast as fuck you probably missed us
Cemetery grave cause you diss us
Better think twice, if you want your life
When we roll up to your crib you, think through your rights
Think money think long, keep the future bright
If you're smart about your game, you'd stay out of sight
Got love for this like Aphrodite
Think money think long, keep the future bright, and get at me


[Hook: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace



[Intro: Sample & Drake]
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of C-notes, get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves

[Chorus: Sample]
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Drake]
Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese, you don't want drama, capisc'?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me, it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

[Chorus: Sample]
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh




[Verse 1:]
Uh, I'm feeling so throwed
I done had this drink since I was 15
And now I'm finally getting on, told you bout this shit when I was 18
And fuck it, I'm the new nigga, don't give a fuck bout how these niggas rate me
Ya girlfriend wanna cruise with us, but I'mma need a badder bitch to date me
Uh, I got this money in my pocket
I won't throw it 'less she dropping
Know what? Fuck it, bitch go shopping
See I always keep it cocky, cause these niggas wanna doubt me
Talking numbers like a auction
Fuck yo Porsche and yo bugatti that you always talk about
But I dont never see you driving
Cause you know that niggas hungry and you looking at a lion
I'm the fucking last king eating dinner with the mayans
Yeah you riding for yo city, but I'm driving BITCH!

[Hook:]
All I care about is money, give a fuck about the hoes
Broke or rich, I'm on my shit
Gotta let these motherfuckas know
Put my H up in the sky and for Screw I drop a 4
My city calling for me but I'm gone
Say hello say hello, gotta do what I do let me go (x4)
Say none of yall niggas can do it like me
Puffing that purp, fucking up pink
And I don't give a fuck about tint and shit
Only one deep, gotta pimp my shit
Say hello say hello gotta do what I do let me go (x2)

[Verse 2:]
I take a look around the club, I done fucked everybody
Man I'mma need some newer bitches with some newer bodies
The type-a bitch that don't know shit and she don't know nobody
So I can mold like a vent, yep polarize it
I know some niggas I was with that went and told somebody
About some shit he said he never would've told nobody, damn
Now I prolly got you shook
See we kick it all the time and I ain't never brought it up
Hmm, shit, gotta keep the shit G
Cause the niggas playing cool be the niggas with the heat
Yeah them niggas still in school prolly knock you off ya feet
Talk is cheap, paying dues, no receipt
I got bad bitches waiting, boys intimidated
And I still can't believe I got signed to a label
I guess I gotta do it while it's all in my favor
And next year I'll be on vacation BANGZ!

[Hook:]


[Verse 1: Salience]
Fill up all of my cup
Give me all of your love
All I need is just that touch
I'm not here to go and judge
Take you back to my place, you and me
Get you pillow talking fluently
Take your clothes off and your jewelry
Get you all the way down-down to your knees ay
Name a time and a place and I'll be there
You're so hot, you be giving me a fever
Take your time, I'll be getting more eager
Let me get to know you just a little bit deeper
Let me show you luxury
You and I make good company
Whisper in your ear so subtly
Come here, babe, make love with me and

[Hook: James Fauntleroy & Drake]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you


[Verse 2: Salience]
Say my name so your old boy goes and hears it
Show him you are fearless
And he ain't allowed near it
I got you babe and you know I'll never let you go
You stole my heart, but my love supply is plentiful
And now hypnotized by the way you're dancing
I'll treat you like a queen; I'll make your life enchanting
'Cause now I know how to treat a lady right
And I know that you gon love it, you can stay here day or night
And if you want it there, I'll take you there
You say you love me, and I'll say I care
You get mad at me when I ain't prepared
But sorry those 3 words get me scared
I don’t know what got over me
I'll bag it up like groceries
Don’t write me off like a notary
I guess love is what the beholder sees
And I know, don’t tell it
Right now I'm being so selfish
I know that you and me right now is all the matters so don’t you sweat it
So baby, listen to me right now
We have it on, I don’t really wanna fight now
Leave it 'til tomorrow, all you gotta do is say my name and turn all the lights down

[Hook]



Instrumental: Girls Love Beyoncé by Drake

[First Verse]
Today? That should be my day of no luck
It’s the thirteenth/ weren’t we here just a second ago?
Oh, a year maybe? That’s my reckoning so
Recollecting on how we disconnected
I fell through the cracks/ came back nauseated
And hating the fact my insecurities kept pulling me down for real
So sick/ couldn’t go/ feeling to throw up
I was torn up/ thoughts tormented and so fucked
Going insane ‘cause I chose one
Couldn’t fathom ever having to let her go
And you know what? I’d be lying in my bed
Stare up the ceiling ‘til the minute that she’d walk by
And step inside/ say ‘hi’/ chill a bit
Then at best give a hug or a goodbye and yet
I would pray she stayed like the days that we lost
Making our way to the way that we was
But my major mistake – I remained unlocked
Put my all on display but then failure popped
Wave after wave but I still gave a fuck
Wish I was making this up but I’m not
There were days I would wake up and then doze straight off
‘Cause I couldn’t deal with it
Mind, body, soul set ablaze/ make it stop!
I would say to myself/ hate how I felt
This girl got me so dishevelled to the point
That the Devil himself couldn’t take it
And put in a request that I’d be sent straight out of Hell
I’m not one to place the blame for any of this major pain
That I was put through/ wishing you would say name
Because I felt hurt/ trapped in this cell worth less
And I ain’t even got to the L word yet

[Hook: Drake & James Fauntleroy]
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
Say ‘baby, I love you’
If you ain’t running game
Say my name say my name
You acting kinda shady
Baby why the sudden change?
Say my name say my name
Say my name, ooh
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you

[Second Verse]
See I felt hurt
But I never gave up/ I was mad/ too attached
I was dumb/ I was blind/ I was axing the facts
Ignoring every instinct/ collapse ‘em and act
Like everything was okay/ I was being me
Then I started seeing cracks/ soon enough
There was no way I could ever feel like I’d match up
To these man you would hang with so I backed up
Struggling in silence/ muffling my voice
No more muscle to get violent
Stepped up a gear still I felt like my rebuttal had no mileage
Tired out/ drained and trapped in this madness/ unh
At times I could swear I was an actor
Tryna be like these guys/ oh my…
Think back like “KD, why would you do that shit?!”
Selling out just to tell ‘em how you were there
Take notice but still you would let her down
You dived in headfirst/ got hurt and that’s it
Better man up and stand up and act in a manner
That won’t go expose just how deeply enamoured
You are with this girl and then damage your status
Shatter your chances/ your heart and your sanity
Man I remember that happening back then how manic I felt
What I had with this girl brought me back to anxiety (Ugh!)
Who the fuck was I tryna be?! (Ugh!)
Couldn’t help but think rightfully (Ungh!)
That you’d never be mine fully (Nah…)

[Hook: Drake & James Fauntleroy]
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
Say ‘baby, I love you’
If you ain’t running game
Say my name say my name
You acting kinda shady
Baby why the sudden change?
Say my name say my name
Say my name, ooh
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you

[Third Verse]
So a year back from today
I was in my room with a few tracks I could play
As a soundtrack to my night
We had talked/ sorted shit/ got along
No scraps on the plate but we still weren’t acting the same
Sat back had this one track on replay
Then I realised next day it was V Day
Fuck! We weren’t together but we were
So was I obliged to assign you a gift
And remind you of how much I liked you? Shit…
So I dashed out to get you some flowers but they were sold out
(Ah fuck’s sake…) Came back to my seat so defeated
I think that you came home late with some flowers and gifts
That some other guy showered you with
I ain’t gonna lie/ I was down I was pissed
Felt like I lost all power from my grip
I was bound to this black cloud hounding me
Sick…but I didn’t show anger aimed at a man that I didn’t know
Fuck that! I was down for that shit
Tryna decode everything you were saying
I was overthinking all these codes and meanings
In my Mona Lisa in the hope one day that you’d know I mean it
‘Cause the coldest feeling was not knowing
You see its…(KD!!!)
(Alright alright…)
Fast forward past all the bullshit and let’s look at March onwards
Skip ahead to tonight where I’m with you
But this time I got my flowers and gifts all ready to surprise you
It’s only now I look back ‘cause I can with a smile
Yeah we had those times/ you get mad all the time
But nowadays I don’t even have to ask if you wanna be my Valentine

I would never say that…
That was just for you…


[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you we a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?


[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 2: Drake]
I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?


[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa



This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe

If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy

It's crazy, I can't help it if you feelin' change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change

Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life

You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy

Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby


[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly"
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em"
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, "'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill"
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real


[Outro]
Yeah, that's all I can say



[Intro: Drake]
Reps Up, OVO, you already

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill
I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit
And like you just got traded, girl you don't know who you're playin' with
Aw yeah, aw yeah, and my sound is what up right now
I've been down but I'm up right now
Nigga been backstrokin' and breaststrokin'
Through that lane that you left open, man I don't give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla at me

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I got two tings comin' through
And they do whatever I want 'em to
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin' up for real
I used to drive the Acura to school
Now I don't touch the wheel unless it's new
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin up for real

[Verse 2: OB OBrien & Drake]
Passin' up on pretty women everyday (We do that shit!)
I like getting money, I love getting paid (You knew that shit!)
Bitches tell me that I look like 40 everyday (for sho)
That's OK, I'll go and fuck them forty minutes straight (hey!)
Hey, showin' up to 40 forty minutes late (alright, alright)
Just send forty to The H and put forty in the safe (alright, alright)
Damn, I got forty on my neck and wrist (right!)
OVO Soundboy, got 40 on the mix (sound, mix!)
Mix, all I do is mix (mix!)
All my tings are mixed (mix!) and I make 'em mix (mix!)
That means I make 'em kiss, I make 'em pop, I make 'em strip
(Alright, alright!) TOPSZN, I just sprinkle with my fingertips

[Verse 3: Drake & OB O'Brien]
No Money Manziel, the game is at a stand still
How am I the man still? How am I the man still?
I, I might, I might call up Pam still
Tell em bring a can still, brrt brrt brrt!
Still, tell them bring the rider, get my roll on
Big Tymer ting, go get your roll on
Tell them basic bitches they can hold on
I'm at the Hazey in the lobby with my robe on
Bring you to Habibiz, get your smoke on
I been going Hamilton for so long, yeah
This ain't a joke ting, I want the whole thing
I want my new ting, to meet my old ting
Let them get well acquainted, let them get hella faded
I'm halfway through the race and I'm already celebrating
I'm on that Y shit, I'm back on my shit
I ran the game so long I should be wearing Dri-FIT
Oh yeah I'm poppin' again
And it kills me to yell out free Baka again
But free Baka again, and free Greezy one time
Shout out Sammy and Peezy one time, you know what it is
She's like "TOPSZN, is that a bad thing?"
I'm like "I don't know, are you a bad ting?"

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I got two tings comin' through
And they do whatever I want 'em to
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin' up for real
I used to drive the Acura to school
Now I don't touch the wheel unless it's new
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin up for real

[Verse 4: P. Reign]
Reps Up tell anybody, OVO we ain't just anybody
Flight risk on my right wrist, I been cookin' up to feed everybody
I get a chicken, one night about it
We'll fuck your bitch and then write about it
Made a half a mil', went and bought a choppa
Cause nowadays you can't kill without it, bow!
We the stars, in the six, we the gods
Found the guns I'll beat the charge
I left the court screaming "Fuck the law, these hoes and all!"
I'm a star, like that steak, nigga way too raw
Run the streets, I hate the beef cause I take that shit way too far
Yeah, OVO the clique, I told Drake when we were kids
I'll ride with the 45 until the day we run the 6
Tell them niggas don't play it
Someone tell Flex drop a bomb cause we made it
Hop on the jet and fly over to Haiti
Just so you know I was high when I made this, run up

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I got two tings comin' through
And they do whatever I want 'em to
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin' up for real
I used to drive the Acura to school
Now I don't touch the wheel unless it's new
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin up for real

[Bridge: Drake]
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
We call that schemin' up for real
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
We call that schemin' up for real

[Outro: OB OBrien]
We dreaming up
TOPSZN we that new regime, we schemin' up
OVO Sound, crank it up
TOPSZN we that new regime, we schemin' up

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse]
I'm in New York and you're in Long Island
I don't even treat you that good, girl, why you smilin'?
It's three in the mornin', why are you drivin'?
Why you stoppin' for gas to get on the highway, just to end up in my place?


[Verse 1]
Look, here we go
The first time around
I left the cars at the house and I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its about the rhyming now
Im seeing it clearer the season is nearer
And still I must change
Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm outspoken still
They not sure of the work but they all hoping he'll
Emerge to victor my words are pictures
And guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture
With 4 walls give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I've been thinking before y'all
I barely get tired I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week what I'm daily required
I meet quotas while you rappers having sleep-overs
Spending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova
Be in the throne instead of being your own
But Look

[Verse 2]
I'm making moves in my city so
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though
Important and vital I'm caught in a cycle
This is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain it, my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats a screw face
Rappers befriend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace
Thats why I tuck em in not giving a fuck again
D.R.A. you add a K.E
A couple mill and you labels cannot play me
I never go broke I'm far from a flash in the pan
I am a passionate man, plan it with cash in my hand
Uh


[Verse 3]
I got few days left
But I'mma make use of every single one until every singles done
Until every record is sold, and every string is strung
Tell me take a breather Drake and everything will come
Dog its always been the same
Its all love like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in the driveway
I roll down strips and hose down whips
That when turtle wax up they would close down Richmond
With no down shifting
Haters would say I'm adequate
Think I got the type of flow that would make an addict quit
21 years I've been pimping since being
Repurchased trap music 4 times since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince
Getting pennies for my thoughts
So I put my two cents in
Top of the morning I am dropping the coin in
Plus I'm changing the game
You hear me swapping the joint in
They put the fires out and bring the buyers out
And try and box us all together before they buy us out
If they profit from the events we handing flyers out
Then we profit from the attempts to hand desires out
But rich is how we all ending up
I'm at the label in the elevator send them up



Verse 1:
You ready to hear me out?
All the lies man they coming out
I said I was a real one
Y’all said I ain’t shit son
Real dad I’mma real son
Mom’s bad but I still got one
Chief’s had it I still come
Keep getting hurt I still cum
In class I blurted out the answer
But really did i even hear the question?
Lies told disregarded all them blessings
No meat but I was still dressing
That’s that thanksgiving
I mean, no turkey at least it was still chicken
I’ll flip the bird it’s absurd was allergic to eggs
Yet somehow that discounted the milk I was drinking
Beg for another chance I was learning them lessons
Back when people weren’t checking for Teslas
Tried to send some letters I wasn’t getting the message
Got so many blessings but I’m complaining cause I’m stressing
About no facts all fiction my future I was guessing
Would end up scarred up and all cut
From the head, toes. Dead foes
Laying all in my trunk
I got some dead clones, led phone
Talks I was crushing
Got two girls inside two worlds thought I was something
Preferred death row, inside some bows and a hole
No rope to hang on so I stayed gone
I came and went but wasn’t ever gone…..
Damn I came and went but I wasn’t ever gone
Was by myself but nah was never alone
God one day is gonna show me up into my throne
Not until my current king’s dethroned from my zone
Ode to all the holes I’ve blown
Gone from sipping vodka, drinking on whiskey I’m missing patron
That should tell you all the harbored bullshit that I be on
I want all the smoke so just pack up the cone
All good I’ve been sleeping nigga
Made a promise couldn’t keep it nigga
We excellent and kings but we still niggas
When we gonna stop tearing down niggas?
When we gonna stop using this word niggas?
We are Negus eygptian kings nigga
Nigga comes from the word Nigga
Called us niggers cause they couldn’t think quicker
Called us niggers cause they read up on our scriptures
Said we was the force to take down
Why you think we hating on each other now?
Back then the trend to stick together is the very thing that allowed us to sever all the contesters
We gotta show that love to our ancestors
I’ll tell you what
You put me back into that time I wouldn’t give a fuck
I would shoot them up and die fighting for my message
We can’t even congregate with the cops being called
Not a lot of black businesses so we just stall
We buy the new Jordans buy the new kicks
But that man that own that shit ain’t fighting for these kids
Get these fuckers out
Got black billionaires but don’t see the money being spread out

A lot of bullshit I’m tryna air it out
You see what I’m about?

Verse 2:
We destroying ourselves before we having e a chance
Was told if music was played that I should dance
Tried to fix all my former decisions I got lanced
Tried weed after I got straight A’s was tranced
Didn’t need to be in choir to pop all them bands
Ain’t talking cash I’m talking yu-gi-oh cards
I stand behind every man even if a wo’s attached with it
Wouldn’t wish my life upon my worst critics
Popped shit onto everything I’ve ever owned
Didn’t know it was my life I thought that it was loaned
I guess it is what it is I wasn’t like them kids
They all cried cause of missing parents I faked the shit
Just a list of what I did just to feel a feeling of feeling belonged
Drank, smoked, I drove my license it wasn’t ever gone
Threw up listening to toni, tony, tone
That’s how I pronounced it
When it came to thinking I was bouncing
Off the walls put shit on walls it was nothing
Held me till I was aroused
That was all me
Cried for your mentions
My electrocution wasn’t execution
Chest was small I was reckless
Screaming I cracked my head on the crackhead wall just to see him smile
Kept pulling my pants down yo look they laughing now
I’m getting that attention
Saying life is a bitch instead of a beach
Was cracking jokes wanted to punch the kid in the throat for messing

Let me talk to ‘em don’t cut the beat
Growing up I treated myself like Frieza
I purposely dumbed myself down to hang around people of the same age
I always got along with older people because my mind was in a different place
Pops always said hold 25% back in everything you do
Just in case you needed to pull out you got something left
I created my base form, 25%, 50%, 75%
I then made it a wish to fuse with myself
Making 75% my base form being a requirement for this fusion to happen
Once it does, I master 75% and can tap into 100% power
Self-actualization is the name of the game
Yet, I found I just kept pushing my capabilities to the wayside to run away from being alone
I wasn’t taught in the correct way to be alone. By the time my pops got to me it was too late
I was already filled with hate by that time and too jaded to keep up
Year after year I kept losing myself more and more until I’m staring at my back
Like my facebook profile picture. This is “The Catch Up”
In order to catch me I gotta turn my back on everything else
This project is me airing it all out
Let it all go now or deal with it in the next life
Lay on the Pedal baby, Fix Yourself Project, Day X
Doesn’t matter how long it takes, start that journey
Because that’s what I’m doing
Borealis, aka Aurora, CO. Love it man
Respect that




Lyrics from Snippet 1

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, uh
I'm feelin' you, guaranteed that you into me
I got the phantom, the aston, the bent-e-ley
But let me tell you where a nigga at mentally
Two things I don't give a bitch: pay checks and sympathy
Ha! But I guess it's just the pimp in me
All around paid, can't even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart, sentence me
I ain't worried it's gon' happen if it's meant to be
And if you ever feel the need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we living separate lives
Trying to tell you, less feelings mean less goodbyes
That's some game for your ass, better recognize
But some cats can't even relate
I ain't a mind reader though, so if you tryna escape
Then let me know that, show that
My place, roll back, lay down, so flat
Tell Me!

Lyrics from Snippet 2

[Verse 2]
... Talkin' and a lil chit-chat
You rollin' with me, then we fucking when we get back
That's a [?], tell me if you with that
Don't decline, just recline, sit back
[?] straight ...


...I think they hearin' you now, someone said nigga they takin' you seriously now, I'm like "I think they just might be scared of me now", but it's all good niggas wrong everyday, niggas wrong everyday, oh...



Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woop to the bangers
Su-woop to the bangers, (yeah)
And I say, I be on some G shit
I be on some G shit
Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch

Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love
Cause I don't have the time for thatt
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggas for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

I a'int have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I a'int have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight

Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woop to the (whoa oh oh ohh)


[Hook (x3)]
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world

[Verse: Drake]
Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball

[Hook]
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world

*Lyrics from Snippet*

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Oh yeah, yeah (show a nigga)
This is what you want (show a nigga)
This is what you want
Have another bottle with me (with me)
Smoke a few blunts with me (me)
Sun is up, summer time on it (yeah, yeah)
Pool party, yeah I do you naughty

[Intro: Drake]

The guys want you

But what can we do
If I just keep it honest, promise you will be too
Cause you told me that everything I'm doings brand new
I watch you getting dressed
So just appreciate the view
They ask why I let her go out alone
I say I don't feel no pressure coz I know she's coming home
And my

So she's always tryna housie
Anything she puts on her body's the perfect outfit


[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I don't see the problem

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that "wine 'n' dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, "Choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I'm get to it)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
'cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Carter 4 Tunechi
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will
I think I love her




[Intro]
Lil Wayne Freestyle nigga

[Verse 1:Kayo Stone]
I told you
I'm gonna pump that bass like a real playa
I already slick but I'm just still a hater
Niggas are ruthless , I am careless
Young Stoner smoking that sour
It's the man of the hour
The clock is ticking minute by minute
You niggas sleeping on me like you restless
Rent a room to the tropics at the Hilton
Shit, what knocks you down like Keri Hilson
I got dead presidents like Woodrow Wilson
I'm fucking on your bitch until she says my name
I say this is how we do it so I put on The Game
She Says Kayo are you famous because you got the fame
This shit ride hard I put It into flames
I remember as that one dame
Who says she doesn't like those fakes and lames
Shutdown the streets but don't shut down the whole world
She dances like she some white girl
She goes crazy for my projects
Every time I come with something brand new
I'm known as a famous artist and that is true
You know I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now please listen to my mixtape

[Hook: Drake]

[Verse 2]
Now I'm gonna pump the bass like a real playa
Sharper than the teeth of an alligator
I'm now the newest face of The Fader
Working day to day but I'm not even a waiter
Fuck all that back and forth I leave you now and later
Because I'm now that fucking hater
I throw shades like slim shady
I knew I had To move to Little Haiti
And I will be stunning like my baby
If I was to be a baller , maybe
If this would get all the sexy ladies
I know all the sex moves Kama Sutra novelties
I'm gotten them all in check, pass the inspection
Please look into my direction
I stand tall like a half erection
I failed out of school I don't need corrections
These bitches see me as I'm in One direction
Harry Styles showed me that one direction
The whole nation wanna see my true reputation
Give her a dope dick chronic masturbation
I Got to want a rapper , Fascination
I feel good with no vaccination
I talk my own shit new conversation


[Verse]
Now go and pop that pussy like a real nigga


[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her "now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet

Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her "go on! Pop that pussy for me"

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Pandemonium, she cause that
Toss it up, and I stuff 'em where her draws at
That's on everything like feets that's on my floor mats
Red bottoms, spikes on 'em, that's dos stacks
Speakin' Spanish while she tannin', body no fat
Shawty body body got me on my 4th stack
Pink champagne, order Moët
Rollin' airplanes, where I land at?
I levitate over numbers you niggas never make
The Columbians callin', I tell 'em "perate"
Every summer I celebrate with a new estate
Let's get the fuck out this club, call it the great escape
She wrap her lips 'round a nigga, just like a chinchilla
Crap table Bellagio, I'm a big tipper
My life a stage I need her just to stand on it
Every time she look back, I toss a band on it

[Chorus: Drake]
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will



[Intro: Cryptic Wisdom]
Life, sometimes it feels like she treats other people better then you
And you want her to treat you better
Shit, treat that bitch right man
And she will

[Verse 1: Cryptic Wisdom]
The money, fame, and power, I ain't seen it yet
But people linin' up like "I wonder what we can get"
It ain't a problem, but when I know this my friends
Coming back when there's some ends and running back when that shit ends
It's kinda funny, I guess the money makes them act a little strange
It don't change the person with it, just the people in yo space
I'm spacing out, my brain is orbiting
I stare up at the galaxy at night like I'm absorbing it
Cause that's my only pal, there ain't a doubt in mind
The only one that I can turn to when I'm out of time
You treat your life well, that bitch will treat you fine
There's always silver-lining, just read between the signs
The great divine rest upon my shoulders
I was meant for higher purpose those of us who wear ?
I'd live forever if she let me hope she will
Cause this life is just to good to be this real

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

[Verse 2: Cryptic Wisdom]
It's hardwired in my brain, the music thang
That's the gift that life has given to me like a fuel to flame
And see my gift back is what I am because of it
The game is waitin' on me cause they know I'm on some other shit
Sometimes you gotta take a step back and ask yourself
"Is it my time yet, what am I after?"
Well, I'm after wealth but that's the big picture forever
So meanwhile I've been playing chess up on your checkerboards
I'm breaking all the rules
I'm in the fast lane holding up the traffic moving carefully and past games
They say the one's that have it all, they took the time for it
I want the world in my palms, I've got the time for it
Cause this is my life, I'm in control of it
She's worked all of the pain and all the years that I was broke for this
I'd live forever if she let me hope she will
Cause this life is just to good to be this real

[Hook]




[Verse 1]
24 seconds, yeah, you better not stop
You got 24 seconds, can you beat the shot clock?
What you waitin' on, lil' daddy? I ain't got that much time
You seem anxious, you seem adamant but you ain't pressed my line
Wondering why, why, why (Oh why)
Know you ain't shy, shy, shy (Oh why)
I'ma say bye, bye, bye, better know I won't think twice (Yeah)
Better let go of your pride (Do-do)
Do it now (Do-do), just do it now (Do-do), oh yeah
(Do-do)

[Pre-Chorus]
When that nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down
You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now

[Chorus]
Shot clock
(Don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, nigga)
Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, my nigga)

[Verse 2]
Five years of dating, tired of being patient
What the fuck you're waiting for? Oh, yeah
It's a lot of niggas hating and I don't entertain 'em
But damn, you gotta give me more
(Shhh, I know, I know and I'm really trying, but...)
Oh-ohh, if you don't want it like me
I could think about a hundred things I could be doing right now
Than wasting my time with you, oh (Do-do)
Okay, okay, since you gotta have it your way (Do-do)
I'm have to start that clock on you (Do-do)
We gon' see what's up

[Pre-Chorus]
When that nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down (Wind down)
You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now (Right now, yeah-eah)

[Chorus]
Shot clock
(Don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock (Shot clock)
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, nigga)
Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock, shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, my nigga)
Shot clock

[Bridge]
24 seconds
(Don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
You got 24 seconds
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, nigga)
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
You gon' miss your opportunity
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, my nigga, ayy)
Shot clock

[Outro]
L, Love
Add "-rs" and that's surely what we are
Flip it 'round, add "-ve" and let's see if this goes far
Full of chuckles and cuddles and sometimes, eye puddles
Compose love like we're Mozart


[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-woah, oh, woah)
A shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-woah, oh, woah)
A shot for me


[Verse 2]
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place; not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misin-terpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-woah, oh, woah)
A shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-woah, oh, woah)
A shot for me

[Outro]
Yeah
May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accept you



[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad 'cause she ain't like me
Oh you're mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're tryna find somebody
To replace what I gave to ya
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Don't need ya, could care less
I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the best, yeah I said
Boy, I'm the best, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you got your hair cut
Did you forget that's me?
The voice in your speaker right now
That's me, that's me
And that voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see, that I made it, yeah I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Okay look, I'm honest, boy I can't lie I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me, boy I don't get you
He says I know you changed, I never see you
'Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish he had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
I can tell that you've been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover

[Bridge]
'Cause baby I'm the best
I'm the, I'm the best
The best you ever had
The best you ever had

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me

They said I wasn’t gon show up, that’s what the real talk was about
Well I showed up with Showwoutt and you know he show out, i have him beatcha till ya blood fly all in the crowd all of the crowd
My city a real life jungle, I ain’t ever shook at night
I seen them Raptors up close before they booked my flight
What you 85 pounds? Ha ha ha … I mean you look that light
I could drop you off a jab, so imagine if I hook that right
I got killers running back in the field, no Forte
Respected everywhere from St. Louis to Norway
Slam yo ass right on stage, make the floor shake
Ain’t nobody leaving, Show, cover the doorway
Nina, ménage a trios, fuck what his whore say
The deuce deuce give em a kiss, that’s foreplay (4 play)
I match that Glock with a Fif, that’s how I throwaway
I snap and toss Shotty out that window like a throwaway
Y’all gon fuck around and get this sweet boy shot
You cross this line I shoot the tre, no 3 point shot
Double meaning, you cross the line there’s no 3 point shot
But when I say I shoot the tre-
[Crowd member comes on stage and shouts]
Who’s supposed to be the champ up north? Pat Stay?
Man look ... I’ll lyrically smack Stay
Switch moves, turn around, smack Stay
Chop em up, they find his body where Smack stay
No joking I’ll really get at Stay
Like “Man what the fuck you smoking? Crack, Stay?”
My nickname Freddy with this Kruger I clutch
My baby momma left me, she said I sleep with the Ruger too much
And you know that bitch loaded, this Ruger from Lux
A Smith & Wes’ and a Taurus, this a Ruger Deluxe
This battle mean nothing my nigga, I’m a fuckin vet
So take this personal, you’re just a fuckin check
Drake let me get something straight, I’m up-fucking-set
Y’all through me in a dunk contest with a nigga who can’t touch the net?
I was at the airport with just 30 shots, that just mean more can get it
I’m a king so they ain’t check us (checkers)
How you think I flew across border (the board) with it?
I jumped off the plane hungry, like where my body at?
They offered me some food, I’m like “Cool, where Shotty at?”
You had a classic with a nigga I killed? You know I body cats
Battle after battle, I stretch em out, Pilate cats
It’s more than a Shmurda when I pull out this Bobby black
(Showwoutt: Nah, I’ma shoot em) Man gimme my shotty back
Toronto front page, Hitman blew Shotty back
It’s gon be more than a Shmurda when I pull out this Bobby black
(Showwoutt: Nah, I’ma shoot em) Nigga gimme my shotty back
(Showwoutt: Nah, I’ma shoot em) Nigga gimme my shotty back
(Showwoutt: Nah nah, I’ma shoot em) Nigga gimme my shotty back
Toronto front page, Hitman blew Shotty back


[Round 1: SHOTTY HORROH]
{Shotty testing the mic}
Y'all want some real shit now?
Y'all want some real shit now?


Some said I wasn’t gon show up, but that’s what the talking’s about
But I show up to the showdown to show off when the show’s on
For all of the crowd, so it’s showtime
So it’s Showtime in the words of Verb cuz that’s your idol
You a showman, you showing up with Showwoutt to the big show
But I Paul White ya that’s, chokeslam him during his remix
If show starts I got show stopper with a super kick that’s Shawn Michaels
Plus I got a sharp shooter in Montreal
That’ll finish Hitman like Shawn Michaels
I'll let you know know I got respect for Show
Cuz he reps his bro that’s Hitman’s brother
It’s no secret still, when he had that beef with Bill
Who did they hit? Man’s brother
But today I showed up with something for him
That can deflect and hit man’s brother
For a win (Owen) you can die in the ring like Hitman’s brother
You know Owen/a win, dead in the ring let JR talk to em
If you think Jerry the King, remix that
Where I’m from we cut war and remix that
Don’t take man for no kind of Charron out here, keep it rap
Cuz we know this bitch ain’t down with Action like Azealia Banks
Oh here we go
Oh here we go, 3 rounds alike of basketball is what you gonna do
No bars, just remixes and dance routines as substitute
Try me without all that shit, some of that he couldn’t do
You’ll need your brother to help you catch the body like the Dudleys move
I got space in that graveyard and you just made a grave mistake
Keep talking shit, you’ll all get lit
They’ll be mourning/morning Hit like a wake and bake
Little Gerald, Little Gerald...
Little Gerald, Gerald it’s time to talk
When that show’s over the long nose will show us Jerry’s Final Thoughts
Oh you brought ya crew to do me dirty well derrty don’t get me pissed off
There'll be a (Erick) Sermon I'll Parish (Smith) when that shit splits hit's squad (Hit Squad)
Talking bout “re-reload the bullet that came out em” dumb clown
Or maybe that’s your way of admitting you only ever have one round
King Of Performance? On what ground?
You can do that Billie Jean bullshit on Smack but not now
We’re the wrong crowd
See you deliver ... your rhymes ... real slow
And you can stretch a minute into two with that
Ganik are you stupid this is (Boujie?) versus Supernat
I don’t know what to do with that
Could’ve done this in Missouri
Handmade zip cuz, even in the Lou he (Louie) bags
Well he’ll try me, but if he dare we on his face like the Gucci tat
Aye, KOTD, Blackout I ain’t come to mess around
Shotty knock his bredrin down
You disloyal piece of- … oooohhhh, I’ll save that for the second round


[Round 2: HITMAN HOLLA]
Man first off I took a $10,000 pay cut just to take this battle
And I still made $10,000 more than you make per battle
You see this big boy talk, he don’t like it, it get him hella tight
Man, you ain’t worth my presence
If it wasn’t for these fans I would’ve battled you via satellite
Check my background, I’m not a nigga to play with
I spray quick, big Mossberg, give em a facelift
I’m Caesar, I give a sign and my niggas will swing through on some ape shit
You beefing? You beefin'? I’ma hit you where it hurt like who you lay with
In other words I’m just gon' fuck ya bitch on some Drake shit
Then send it to Worldstar on some “I ain’t know it was taped” shit
Just so y’all can see what the bitch left on her face with
All that slick talk, watch ya mouth, I’m saying
One shot will hit and flip you out ya van
This ya dog? Man I’ll beat the Shih Tzu out ya man
Then pistol whip the pistol out ya hand
Man fuck everybody until my mama through with cancer
I might show up to ya show just to shoot a dancer
Who you fooling like you fighting and you move with hammers?
Boy you wouldn’t raise ya hand if you knew the answer
In this battle rap world I’m in, fuck being humble
Heavyweight, view by view, I do the sickest number
Five punch combo connect, man that’s vicious thunder
Straight left, lift em up, uppercut, flip em under
I get the swinging like I’m trying to break Griffey numbers
Man I’ll beat you to the white meat and say I told you so
Ya bitch gon' date a crackhead like that Khloe hoe
With that Desert Eagle, I turn into the Mamba, the Kobe show
I hope you know, I put that bird on ya chest like OVO
They call me every day like “Hitman y'all looting”
Rest In Peace Mike Brown
But white boy I was still pissed about the Trayvon shootin'
So I’m masked up, looking like a Raekwon movement
Me and my dogs will get to hunting like the K9 unit
What? Since he’s a skinhead that acts out of control
I’m supposed to believe what he rapping y’all?
You from Manchester
The only wild cats we know in the UK play basketball
You, it’s nothing you could do with me boy cuz my clips larger
If Show swing, you’ll land in the crowd, that’s the shit starter
If I swing you’ll land by the bar, cuz I hit harder
Toronto ain’t seen a better 1-2 punch since T-Mac and Vince Carter


[Round 2: SHOTTY HORROH]
Yo, am I good?

They told me I got Holla, that’s when my bad mood started
They ordered a Hitman for the Hitman, I just acquired that new target
Load 'em up, I brought a strap to blast through Shamu’s carcass
When I draw I wipe blood from the picture like a tattoo artist
I’m a baboon snapped in a bamboo bag
With my bare hands to stab through hearts
Started at grassroots and had that American glass roof parted
They want bars! not this brand new tap shoe dance move garbage
I’m the new wave and you really can’t surface after that Tsunami
You got washed by Surf, then got a white boy, boy that’s too gnarly
Try me, I’m on ya crib with a can like you have roof parties
You need Dutch courage to (touch zone?)
I will let that Pac Juice charge me
You was quiet 'til that Remy came out, I’ll put you in that Papoose margin
Like I said, KOTD, Blackout, I ain’t come to mess around
Taste ya medicine, I’ma do a lil' bit of exposing in the 2nd round
Cuz I know why you’re here Gerry
Can we talk about the beef with Smack?
You when you jumped on Twitter swearing on ya team and flag
That if you see em it’s gon' be at least a scrap
But what did he do to deserve any piece of that?
Did he fuck ya bitch? No? D-Did he steal a stack? No…
Oh, he took too long to release the Conceited match
You cheeky twat! How dare you repeatedly bite the hand
That helps feed ya fam
When he was the owner of the only league that let you compete for cash
That man took you from a dirty piece of shit
To a featured brand with a sea of fans
I’m talking before your hairline receded back
And had a teeny chance of making an NBA season draft
He’s the reason you can afford them red leather sequinned pants
And Showwoutt’s fee to do a remix dance
Talking about
Talking about where’s Norbes, Cheeko, and Beasley at
You need appeasing and someone needs to see to that
Shut the fuck up! Miss us with that diva act
The damn truth is you're Frank Lucas
We wouldn’t know you exist if it wouldn’t have been for Smack, but...
You, you said if they release Arsonal first, it’s on the flag and rep of ya people
Well, they did that and you did nothing, so that was very deceitful
When you said you was gonna shoot on blood
Lil' Gerald that never will be
If he shoots on B’s (zombies) then that’s Resident Evil
Me and Arsonal did 6 million, you must act like I ain’t contributed to the hits
Well you and Arsonal did half them numbers in twice the time
If you don’t understand that then you stupid as shit
That means there was a 100% increase when they added me
And removed you from the mix
3 Million … Drake I can’t see him with these Views From The 6

That's my second round in (?)

[Round 3: HITMAN HOLLA]
Man I put niggas to sleep, automatic or handguns
Everybody I clap throws off, Conceited slow that down
Automatic or handguns, everybody I clap dose off
They sent them contracts, I’m like yeah, it’s grind time
But to keep it real I was ready before I signed mine
They told me, switch up and joke, nah that’s Grindtime
I’m more of the “you’ll get choked” a ticking time bomb
A football star, you can ask, I was Moss like
Could switch to that mask and ratchet, the lacrosse type
And if I get mad, I spaz like
“I need everything he made back, I’m the rawest type”
I’m coming for the belt, who got it? Tell em he’s next
The K Shine, it ain’t nothing but Murda, ask T-Rex
When I look at Shotty, naw, I don’t see threat
You was supposed to battle Verb and Ill, and I’m ya final destination?
You see all that prove is you can’t cheat death
I got a Navy Seal connect, man this shit loud
The weapon he just plug me with about his size
It’s war, you run with ya squad, you never switch rides
You get sliced down the middle for not picking sides
They got me back on that wild shit
Knock, knock, knock, who is it? Kidnap his child shit
Pow pow shit, that 40 or that Cal shit
Shotty watch ya mouth, I’m not the one to get loud with
That shit I just did, that’s an effortless move
You Golddust looking motherfucker, you just put me in a wrestling mood
If I decide to bomb first, best believe I'ma land mine
I ain’t scared of no nigga, that boy was from Mankind
Three 2 minute rounds for what? That’s the long road
I could’ve beat you with 3:16’s that’s Stone Cold
A million views every battle is easy, that’s a simple trait
That’s why I’m Hitman “Hollywood” Holla, that’s Triple H
Where I’m from niggas get clapped up in the lobby
The army has been instructed to catch bodies
The officers killing my race like it’s a hobby
In other words ain’t shit horror about Shotty
For 25K Mook could kill a nigga that’s ill
Man for that 10k I’ll kill this nigga for real

[Round 3: SHOTTY HORROH]
You came to talk about balls, and that shit’s so gay
The console it's sold separately, meaning I ain’t with those games
You trying to bring back the old Holla
You need more than tank tops and big rope chains
You need the fire and skill plus the desire and will
And a sponsorship with Rogaine
I’d a killed you when you were ya lil bro's age
For the record I’d a MOP’d that Billy dance for a lil Fame
MOP, Billy Danze, Lil Fame, switch the lane
Spill his brains, when that Shotty’s in his face, this shit’s Cobain
I’d shoot the hair off Holla’s head, trust I got that killer aim
Two hands steady the beam, they support the dot like Drizzy Drake
What’s real to you? Basketball or a gangbanger? Pick that shit
Ain’t no such thing as half way crooks Gerry, and you ain’t with that shit
Split personalities, persona disorder, you see how quick man flip
Aye let’s just say it’s JFK, there’s still questions about who that Hitman is
But I have a question, and I hope you have the answer to it
If battle rap’s a cappella why you always dancing to it
Fuck bars, you and Aye Verb spend your time
Trying to plan the coolest hand maneuvers
You almost did a YMCA just to tell me about a strap you’re using
Fuck you think this is? Fuck you think this is, though?
Fuck you think this is? I ain’t playing Hitman game
Now bald headed white boy shoots and
Everyone’s in black suits like the Hitman game
URL King Of Performance, uhhh let me throw the debate in
I think Roc took ya spot like Coke in the 80’s
I’m in the Dot again
I’m in the Dot again
Deep Waters just passed me the strap in case I actually need it
So if I have to act like an idiot it’d be more clapping and screaming
Then you and Showwoutt after a remix
It’s Horroh, It’s Horroh, the one that brought a Tom in Gerry’s house
To put holes in every wall like Tom & Jerry’s house
But his chick saw em, she let me knock out on the couch
I ain’t rob her, but she still had the Shotty in her mouth
Your chick loves that hard white, not the coco
But tonight I will be over your bird like the sponsor's logo
What? I will be over your bird...
I'm meant to believe the plasticine gangster theme?
I'm meant to believe you’re in the banda with a strap in each hand as you’re trapping keys?
Rapper please, you’ll be shook in the suburbs
Probably get robbed by a gang of geeks
I mean he walk in a white hood and stay quiet, well that’s Assassins Creed
What’s big money to small change? Two words after this
(BALL GAME!)



[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uhh
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)




[Hook: Drake]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right, now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time

[Verse 1: Einstein]
I live for the moments that I will remember
With the people that I might forget
Depending on big-headed I become
And depending on how stubborn and hype I get
I live for the life that I want right now, now, now
But sadly now doesn't come that quick
And I just hate how, how, how
Changing way too hard to fix
I'ma star to pick my cars and whips
And I ain't even made it that far to begin
I go hard for the win but my heart is thin
So failure to me is where I start to quit
So when I start to finish my ego tripping just ends up missing
How can you show me a good time when I ain't even there to begin with


[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How about you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight, and worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl, can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne, presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate it when a backpack rapper get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could: it's in our nature
Young and rich and out of control out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though, so I'mma spend another 10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it Yup!

[Hook]




[Verse 1: Drake]
Took niggas out the hood like I'm from there
So you know it's all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there, nigga
But I had to come through for the remix
On my haven’t-done-a-verse-in-eight-weeks shit
And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don't feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don't know, but they should know
Yeah, I just think it's funny how they dangling the bait
But I'm the one that's killing niggas on the hooks, though
And niggas ain't got a grill, still ice-grill hating
I know y'all already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at thе numbers, nigga, I feel amazing
I'll call Michael Jordan up and Mike will makе it
I'm the young rap nigga with the 'Melo deal
You need to come to OVO for a better deal
Just know a million ain't shit once you get a mil'
And niggas say it’s all good
That’s how you better feel, nigga, nah!
Fuck that, this year I'm talking big stuff
Rolling through the city like a young nigga bricked up
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That's why we never gave a fuck
When a fuck nigga switched up, damn!

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Frontin' like you really on that bullshit
Gun him down, make a motherfucker do a full flip, chip chip
Nigga really really on that Crip shit
Bisquick whip, whip, whip, nigga, move it!
Got the toolie, yeah, the piece, I'mma use it
Nigga ruthless, leave a chump nigga toothless
Tell him "smooches", got that white girl
Get a tan when I ice her, Arm and Hammer
Mixin' venom like a viper, you the buyer
I'm the nigga with the fire, you's a minor
Now I'm major with the paper, coppin' acres
Overseas like a sailor, you a hater
And ya daddy in the same boat, you a busta when ya chain go
Pourin' syrup on my Eggo, four liters for the eight though
To the face, now the day slow, you's a fruity lil' rainbow
Real nigga, call me Django, 50 seconds till the say low
Wild bucks shootin' halos, every pocket got a bank roll
I don't think you really understand me (stand me)
Groovy Q ain't keep the nose candy (candy)

[Verse 3: Fat Trel]
Nigga tell me how you want it with a savage
It get crazy where I'm living it's tragic
If you can take it from my pocket you can have it
You know I got a body bag in the trash
You know I got an old thot you can have
Nigga couldn't fuck my old bitch
Niggas couldn't eat my old pussy
I'm in the kitchen I could tell you how the stove looking
Nigga all I really wanted was the pyrex
A couple hundred body snatchers in the projects
You know my plug stay connected like direct
I'm in Miami my bitches like "where Lebron at?"
I finish fucking her and finish like "where your mom at?"
In front the coppers I got choppers for the combat
Couldn't believe it my niggas say he was sellin' grenades
Keep bullshittin' and ima sit you where the bomb at
D.C. nigga, sittin wrist whip dough
He ain't know a chopper price get this low
See I cop em' in Atlanta bring em' back to Alabama Avenue
And tell them niggas "come and get it let's go"
Fifty in the Mac take em' back to Benning Road
Strippa bitches in my kitchen with the semi's on the floor
All I know I want him dead by tonight
With his head in his lap and his body at the light
Purchase me some Act and I'm a pour me some Sprite
Tell a bitch keep counting till she get the count right
When a bitch finish might purchase her a flight
Might take her whole life
Might fuck her all night
Right, you know I hate to say it twice
But you pussy ass niggas ain't bout that life
Pussy ass niggas ain't bout that life
Pussy ass niggas ain't bout that life

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
Thirty in the clip catch the whole thing
Feds know a nigga by his whole name
Shoot him in his head for his gold chain
You was running ball, we was sellin' cocaine
Talkin bout you buyin' bricks, nigga you ain't got shit
We was sellin' all them keys, we was like the locksmith
Twenty-Five hundred for the red bottoms
Balmain five bands for the waist nigga
I'm rollin' through my city in a new Rolls Royce
Cheif Keef 300 for the Wraith nigga
A.K, S.K, H.K nigga, three K's like I hate niggas
And I'll put you in your place nigga
You got shoebox money I got a safe nigga holdup

[Verse 5: Rick Ross]
Automatic pistol on a nigga leather seat
See a bad bitch she my jam of the week
All I ever wanted was a kilo
Till they hit my little nigga with the RICO
Bitches lookin' at me, Keisha look at all this change
It's the heart of war tour bus full of K's
Master P money I could pull up in a tank
C Murda shooter know a pill on the way
Still [?]
Rich niggas coming through you broke niggas better move
At your front door got word you got work
3.5 for the key of the purp
Now six figures for this fat niggas verse
All eyes on me as I'm walking through the church
Prayin' lord forgive me, 30 shots in the semi
I done paid all of my tithes now it's time to go and get it
My new plug don't fuck with the cut
My new bitch gettin' fucked in the butt
Ridin' by the [?] see me sitting in the trunk
Niggas say they coming threw but they see me strapped up, what
Nigga runnin' in your house for the brown bag
Feds wanna know how much in the brown bag
Nigga swinging that stick for the brown bag
Your bitch even saw my number on the brown bag
All I ever wanted was Kilo
Till they hit my lil' woe with the Rico
Sippin' on purp niggas still got a pint
Still moving work nigga ooh what night
Ooh what a night, ooh what a night
Post a picture of that pussy get 200 likes
200 likes all that bitch getting from me is them 200 likes

[Verse 6: Jeezy]
Made the Forbes and I'm straight up outta projects
Still running with them niggas with that work check
It go "Brrrrrrrr" with the choppa
That's the only way the pussy 'posed to stop ya
Pour out a little liquor, one in every got a ghetto
Stack a 20 bill, nigga, tall as Carmelo
Winter olympic games and the categories caine
Bet ya one fuckin' thing, I'll win a gold medal
Why ya actin' like a bitch? Lil Jon, my nigga
Don't you ever doubt me, I'm like LeBron, my nigga
I ain't takin' no shorts, bitch, I hit it with the fork
Fuck a wrist game, use my whole arm, my nigga
Snowman, bitch, y'all know me
Fourth quarter pressure on 'em like Kobe
Act like my shit don't stink, pocket feel like a bank
Neck lookin' like a 40 ounce of O.E
Tell me why my album selling, they ain't murder me yet
If they do, bury me in a burgundy 'Vette
Talk behind my back, you could hate me all ya want
But them same fuck niggas ain't shot shit yet
Yeah, you see me on Gangland, as real as it get
They just rappin' about it, I was livin' that shit
Straight up

[Chorus: Future]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you ain't popped shit
All you talk 'Nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit

[Bridge: T.I.]
This for my niggas when they walk up out the house, they (turn it)
Fuck what ya mouth say (turn it, turn it)

[Verse 7: T.I.]
Fully automatic rifle, 100 round drum on it with a scope
I done had that, nigga (Brrrrrrr, stick 'em)
I ain't playing with these niggas, just kill 'em, turn it
Nigga talk shit, I'll blast that nigga
Shoot his ass right in front his homeboys
Kill the party, drove off and then stab that nigga
Everyone vicinity hear the boy ho noise
I'm the Zone 1 king, from a whole one thing
Threw a 100 on it, shawty, I was doing my thing
You tryna get a million, I done did that
Aye, keep it pimpin', keep a ticket where I live at
Aye, listen, sucka, I got nothin' for ya but a new coffin
I'll shoot you walkin' 'fore you get through talkin', nigga!
Catch me walkin' in ya hood, trench coat swingin'
Mask on, step up on ya front porch bangin'
Them Bankhead niggas, they a muhfucka, ain't they?
I'm the realest, richest nigga that you know today famous
Catch ya flaggin' in ya hood and ya wanna be a gangsta
In ya skinny jeans in arenas entertainin'
No matter how you paint it, better see the big picture
I'll get ya, nigga, wit' ya, then hit ya nigga!

[Chorus: Future]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you ain't popped shit
All you talk 'Nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit

[Verse 8: Diddy]
I ain't tryna hear a whole bunch of that (shit)
About how many bodies you caught (shit)
My niggas is real thug niggas, them real niggas don't talk
Worldstar niggas get caught, wavin' all them guns at the cameras
Grown ass nigga, you ain't bout to shoot (shit), you don't do (shit)
You just think it's cool (shit) to move bricks
Real niggas do it cause they got to
I know them real niggas and it's not you
And if they see yo' ass round here frontin'
Real shooter be somewhere and shot you
Man, get the fuck out the booth poppin' that (shit)
Corny ass nigga just talkin' that (shit)
Heard about it, read about it, never been around it
But you think ya soft ass give somebody that (shit)
How you movin' round with ya ho?
You ain't even stickin' to the code
You don't even represent the life right
Pussy nigga sleepin' with a night light
Comin' for ya head like Fight Night
I can get anything done for the right price, boy!
(Bad Boy) Take that

[Chorus: Future]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit

[Verse 9: Juicy J]
If money talk then your pockets ain't saying shit
I'm in the bathroom getting head from yo' bitch
And I ain't paying her shit
You want beef? You don't know who you playing with (Hey!)
I tell my pilot to land the jet (Hey!)
I'm hopping off, get 'em, we popping off (Hey!)
Give a click and you niggas dead where you standing at (Hey!)
I'm just a trippy nigga smoking on cabbage
Your money funny like Jim Carrey
I got a bitch and she super bad like Halle
And we still keeping that white like Barry
I'm a rich nigga, still keep a pistol with me
Nigga, you ain't fuckin' with a picture of me
I got all this cake and shooters with me
Just in case you pussy niggas try to get you a piece
What it is, my nigga? What it's hittin' for? (Hey!)
Where the car you were whippin' in you video? (Hey!)
Where the ice at, nigga? Where them pretty hoes? (Hey!)
You a fraud, real niggas already know (Hey!)
Broke-ass niggas, I can't stand 'em (Hey!)
I hit 'em with the cannon
I'm buying off the mall at random (Hey!)
Juicy J, that nigga fresh to death (Hey!)
Smoke it 'til it's nothing left
Peel off, then I'm ghost in my Phantom

[Chorus: Future]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit

[Verse 10: Tracy T]
My killas got shooters on shooters
My killas got shooters on shooters
My killas got shooters on shooters
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang
Knock em down hundred rounds, lotta pounds, kilograms on the ave
How you want it? Quarter thang, half thang, whole slab?
Young Atlanta nigga pull a hammer on ya
Pull up on a nigga in a California
Teach a lame how to flip a couple numbers
Whole summer dope runners getting more commers
Money got me geekin', damn I need more
Alejandro bringin' in them truckloads
Copy that, get racks, nigga ten-four
Choppa bullets just rip a nigga head off
Clip long as a little nigga leg dawg
Empty that and the barrel just smoke
Closed casket, nigga head open
Peel the top back, yeah I’m in the foreign
Wide body and it sittin' on Forgies
Choppa kick like Chuck Norris
Ralph Lauren, my engine full of horses
Aim game insane nigga I’m a marksman
Cocaine white y’all niggas flip porcelain
Blow worth a fortune, million on the fortress
Niggas totin' AK’s like they Glock 40’s

[Chorus: Future]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you ain't popped shit
All you talk 'Nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit

Spending money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit

[Verse 1: Drake]
Took niggas out the hood like I'm from there
So you know it's all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there, nigga
But I had to come through for the remix
On my haven’t-done-a-verse-in-eight-weeks shit
And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don't feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don't know, but they should know
Yeah, I just think it's funny how they dangling the bait
But I'm the one that's killing niggas on the hooks, though
And niggas ain't got a grill, still ice-grill hating
I know y'all already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at the numbers, nigga, I feel amazing
I'll call Michael Jordan up and Mike will make it
I'm the young rap nigga with the 'Melo deal
You need to come to OVO for a better deal
Just know a million ain't shit once you get a mil'
And niggas say it’s all good
That’s how you better feel, nigga, nah!
Fuck that, this year I'm talking big stuff
Rolling through the city like a young nigga bricked up
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That's why we never gave a fuck
When a fuck nigga switched up, damn!


[Chorus: Future & Juicy J]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you ain't popped shit
All you talk 'Nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags (Shit!), nigga, you ain't bought shit (Shit!)
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles (Shit!), nigga, you ain't popped shit (Shit!)
All you talk 'Nana clips (Shit!), nigga, you ain't shot shit (Shit!)
Spending money on these hoes (Shit!), nigga, you ain't fuck shit (Shit!)
Mike-Will Made It! Let's get it! (Ma-fi-UH!)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
If money talk then your pockets ain't saying shit
I'm in the bathroom getting head from yo' bitch
And I ain't paying her shit
You want beef? You don't know who you playing with (Hey!)
I tell my pilot to land the jet (Hey!)
I'm hopping off, get 'em, we popping off (Hey!)
Give a click and you niggas dead where you standing at (Hey!)
I'm just a trippy nigga smoking on cabbage
Your money funny like Jim Carrey

[Intro: Drake]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby, I had to mention
That if you were a star, you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Tryna take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to, put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus: Drake]
Shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

[Interlude: Drake & The-Dream]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on youKi-Killa, Killa

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Uh, girl you the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest (Oh-whoa)
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shutting it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in them Louboutins
What you want, what you need (Yeah)
I can be (Yeah) your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

[Chorus: Drake & The-Dream, Drake & The-Dream]
And together, we shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice (They'd know)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
Every time we come around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
(And they're on it) And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice
They'd know you shut it down

[Bridge: The-Dream]
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations, they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

[Verse 3: Drake & The-Dream]
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets (Yes indeed)
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl, who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

[Chorus: The-Dream & Drake]
You shut that thing down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
You shut it, oh, oh
And they'd notice, they'd notice

[Bridge: The-Dream]
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down, down...

[Part II]

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen, when you pass my way
What can I do, to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl, I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not tryna say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed, and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

[Outro: Drake]
Lay you down, down, down
I’m tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it

At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose


[Bridge: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Uncle Luke]
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

[Bridge: Travis Scott, Swae Lee & Big Hawk]

Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue

[Verse 1: Drake]
Side pieces
I know that you're watching this from home
I can't wait to see you on the road
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out
Wifey sees a text and asks what's this all about
I tell her you're just a friend
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end
I'm asking would you be mine
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you
This goes out to all my side pieces
Side pieces, side pieces
This goes out to all my side pieces
You know that you'll never be the main one
City to city I see you we're in the same one
Side pieces, side
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise for the real king of side pieces Brian McKnight one time

[Verse 2: Brian McKnight]
This is dedicated to all of the side pieces
I know you'll never be more
And you'll always be less
But there's comfort in knowing that you're okay being second best
I already got a starter but I'm looking for the rest of my team
Side pieces in training go on and wave your hands for Drake and me
(Don't be embarrassed)
Side pieces where you at?
(Probably in the top balcony)
I know you're not down here in front of us you got to be way back in the back
(They can't even see us)
Side pieces go on and be, side pieces yeah
Side pieces

And it feels like you're mine, signs of the times, oh, what a time
Playin' it right, playin' it perfect
Laughin' it off, but I know you're hurtin'
Signs of the times, I say all the time
Taking my time, just gets harder to find it
But you're playin' it right, you're playin' me perfect

[Chorus: Drake]
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me

Part I

[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah
(Crowd Talking)

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Pool in my eyes
As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
We gotta listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don’t know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you, girl, I know you


[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours

[Verse 2: Drake]
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you, babe


[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours
Yeah, you know already
Tell you what's not yours
Tell you what's not yours

Part II

[Verse 3: Drake]
Six months since I've been back in the Six
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe

[Bridge: Drake]
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been

[Verse 4: Drake]
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe


[Bridge: Drake]
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
R. Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down



[Chorus: Skepta]
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness (Mm)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Yeah)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Dubplate special)
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness (OVO, BBK, greaze!)
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish

[Verse 1: Skepta]
You don't know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni (Shing!)
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud nine, a man's extra cozy (Bo!) (Greaze!)
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, man's so unruly (Bo!)
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy (Greaze!)
Front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade (Sex)
Red umbrella when I make it rain (Sex)
My whole team winnin', we don't play your game
Sound like me, but they ain't the same (Greaze!)
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans (Yeah)

[Chorus: Skepta]
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness (More Life)
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish (OVO, BBK)
Check my account, that's a madness (Dubplate)
Check my account, that's a madness (Street team)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Greaze!)
Block that account, it's a catfish

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, they're nothin' like me, I'm a fuckin' villain
Go against me, that's a tough decision (Mmm)
Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision (Straight)
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
(Greaze!) So don't forget to remember me (Yeah)
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see (Get me)
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me? (Bo-bo)
(Greaze!) Taliban, Halloween (Icy)
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline (Greaze!) (Bo-bo)
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine (Jeez!)
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now it's my world, you can have the scene

[Chorus: Skepta]
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish




[Verse 1: Drake]
Hey girl
Do you want my number?
That way you can call me
Everytime I come into town
And then I will drive up to your house
And take you out to dinner
I don't expect nothing at all[Chorus:]
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And it feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right
And all this lasts just one night
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow

[Verse 2: Drake]

Hey girl
I'm back in Atlanta
Second dates are lovely
This time you should choose where we go
Need suggestions?
How about the movies?
Many go for ice cream
I'm not picky, you'll let me know[Chorus:]
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And it feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right

[Verse 3: Tommy Stars]

Girl I ain't a pimp (pimp)
Girl I ain't a playa' (no)
And I ain't tryna move too fast
So I'm a just take it slow (slow, slow)
Girl I just wanna know (know, know)
What would happen if we made love?
Would we have the same feelings when we break up?
Would we still spend hours on the phone?
Wishing we was alone
Would you speak to me in a totally different tone?
I don't know but
I can guarantee two things in life
One is death and the other is I can change your whole life
With one night (one night)
Doing wrong always feels so right (so right)
He can start off with a kiss(kiss), leading to a touch
Forming a relationship based solely around lust
I'm tryna' move slow (girl)
Relax in the drift
But everytime I do, my brain's reaction is this...

[Chorus:]

But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And it feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right
And all this lasts just one night
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow


Hey girl
Do you want my number
That way you can call me
Every time I come into town
And then I will
Drive up to your house and
Take you out to dinner
I dont expect nothin at all

Chorus:
But what if we happen to kiss
And we touch
Put a rush on it
And get it over with
Or what if I just know
What you like
And it feels right
Then its over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right
All this lasts
Just one night

Prove you right
All this lasts
Just one night

Slow slow slow

Haha
I ain't tryna be cute but

[Verse 1]
I won't expect you to move as fast as me
Cause I am way too experienced in this love game bitches
And I won't expect you to kiss me
Cause it just won't be everything you wanted and more for sure
And I don't do that cause it's just gonna lead to the touchin' lovin'
Ah baby baby
I'm gonna stop the braggin'
Because what we're gonna be having is
A Little bit this, a little that
And a little bit of boom tap, bap bap
Yeah yeah
And I ain't saying that you down
But I'm tryna turn that frown around

[Hook: Drake]
What if we happen to kiss, then we touch?
Put a rush on it

And all this last just one night?
Maybe we should slow it down
Slow slow slow


[Verse 2]
Yeah, you like that huh?
Baby it's just you, me
Sittin' on the couch
And baby whatever you do, don't say ouch, ouch
Baby, why are you frontin'?
Baby you know that you love it yeah
And I know that you don't want me to judge you
But baby girl I'm the one that is here is with you
Right now, right now, right now
You got the crown
So fuck what they was talking about
Baby I need you too listen
I'm here to stay not to visit
Baby girl I know it's not a simple task
But you know I'm gonna ask

[Hook: Drake]
What if we happen to kiss, then we touch?
Put a rush on it
And get over with
What if I just know what you like and it feels right?
Then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right

Maybe we should slow it down
Slow slow slow


[PND talking]
See let me paint a picture for y'all with me
Me and the girl
She innocent
I'm not so innocent
You guys know what it is though but uh
She shy, she real shy
She tryna put it like she, she too good for me
She know she ain't too good for me
Cause there wouldn't be conversation
We wouldn't be talking
She wouldn't have my number
I wouldn't have hers
She wouldn't be calling my number
Know what I mean? So
She at the crib winkin' and shit
And she, she know what she doing to me
I'm playing with it
I want it
I don't know how far she wanna go
But she ain't really finna going anywhere
So, this is just what to show what she can't have
And I'm also trying to understand, know what I mean?
Let me get back to the hook

[Hook]
What if we happen to kiss, then we touch?
Put a rush on it
And get over with
What if I just know what you like and it feels right?
Then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right
And all this last just one night?
Maybe we should slow it down

[Intro: Drake & Voyce]
It's Drake (Oh)
VO (Yeah)
Amir (Hmm)
Hahaha, Voyce talk to 'em, man

[Chorus: Voyce]
Hi, I see you sitting at home
Nobody's calling you on the phone
Your girls out making a night on the town while you're sitting there all alone
I suggest you come with your crew
Y'all are looking for something to do
'Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little something for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ladies up north represent representing
Ladies down south represent representing
When the mic is in my hand I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was Eric B For President, it's evident
She spend her summers in Jamaica and I love that
They say that she should be a model she's above that
She had a rapper break her heart, had to open her
So she don't even mess with rap, only spoken word
Well, I'm a poet so you know it's get her to going down
And after all this is my city I could show you round
I understand that the shit you facing is crazy
Let me hear your views on the situations in Haiti
Or sit back relax, vibe with ya man
Chill we could talk about Tribes in Sudan
'Cause you gotta understand if I said it then I meant it
I understand that you Afro I'm tryna get to your centric
That's why I got a bottle of Champagne and then I sent it
Over where you sitting, noticed, pretend you didn't
Along with the bottle was a note attached
Here's some tickets to my show you should go to that
And it's a shame money's something that you barely need to knock her
I'm tryna treat her right 'cause she barely treated proper
But you showed up regardless of late choices it's clear
You really came to kick it it with Drake, Voyce and Amir like


[Chorus: Voyce]
Hi, I see you sitting at home
Nobody's calling you on the phone
Your girls out making a night on the town while you're sitting there all alone
I suggest you come with your crew
Y'all are looking for something to do
'Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little something for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you

[Verse 2: Voyce]
'Cause love (Love is in the air)
You know that love is in the air (You see that girl over there, I'm tryna make her smile you know what I mean, we gonna try and make a video later)
I should feel it everywhere
So smile ('Cause she fly, I think I see her friend over there too, you know what I mean)
So smile for me one time and I guarantee we gon have a good time ('Cause ever since rewind we get full of girls like this man, it's just not even a thing...so uh)
'Cause love (Hey girl won't you come here, I got a suggestion you know what I mean)
So smile (Why don't you and your friends, Get with me and my friends, maybe we could be friends you know what I mean, we could do this every weekend...maybe love is in it's self know what I mean, uh)

[Intro: Drake & Skooly]
Yeah
We got London on da Track

[Verse 1: Drake]
This is all God's doin', man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm Satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only twenty-nine, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga (Yeah)

[Refrain: Drake]
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position (Yah)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (21)
Make me call my bro (21, uh)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Baby, I'm a savage, I ain't romantic
When I come around, these rapper niggas start to panic
And they pockets goin' under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstandin'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now (Hatin' now)
She was playin' with me then but she waitin' now (21, 21)
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now (Mansion)
I was fightin' niggas then but I'm sprayin' now (Blastin')
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss (Nope)
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch (Broke)
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit (21)
They the type to stand in line for some free shit (Broke bitch)
Baby girl gon' suck it till her jaws locked (Suck it up)
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block (Fuckin' up)
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin' (21)
We the one droppin' niggas, we the ones (We the ones)
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come (21, 21)
You that nigga snitchin' on your people, huh? (Shh)
21 Savage a.k.a. The Reaper, huh (21)
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin', huh (Ya dig?)

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (Shut the fuck up)
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end (Count the fuck up)
Make me call my bros for assistance (21)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (Bros)
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (Hol' up)
Put me in a fucked-up position (21)
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, dawg

[Verse 3: Drake]
I don't need love, I'm the GOAT, I just hit the beat and float
And I'm sellin' out arenas but you puttin' on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
'Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smokin' in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now I'm cheese
I'ma turn this TSX into a Benz soon
I'ma see a lot of blessin's for my friends soon
Hunnid-fifty-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1", man, a nigga need some leg room

[Refrain: Drake]
Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh

[Chorus: Drake]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, don't




[Hook]
What we doing Drake? (We bag jackin, bitches!)
What we doing Drake? (We bag jackin, bitches!)
Take your whole bag of candy, leave you in the cold
So bring the ruckus if you under 12 years old

[Jay Pharaoh]
It's 7:58 and now your curfew is pushin
Watch how just like Republicans I'm behind the bushes
"It wasn't me" - if you asked me, that's what I'mma tell ya
And I'mma eat so much chocolate, my blood type's Nutella
Got wanted signs from madd parents, state troopers
Kidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch-slapped an Oompa-Loompa

[Hook]

[Drake]
Give me your Reese's Pieces, give me your Hershey bars
I want your Milky Way, give me that Snickers bar
I would Trick-or-Treat but I'm too old now
So I snatch your bag so I don't look like a pedophile
My sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me
We're talking stomach aches, restraining orders, cavities
I probably won't have no teeth when I'm finished
I don't pay for the porcelains, I just marry my dentist

[Hook]


[Hook]
I'm black and Jewish
Don't be so foolish
I'm black and Jewish
It's a Mitzvah

[Verse]
Please don't forget I'm black, please don't forget I'm Jewish
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is
Chilling in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer
Like Baruch Yitadel Yisrael
Ve'et ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy
Do not go to Feingold's, though
The pickles are rubber
And I will not be harming ya
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada
Daddy from Africa
Best of worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya
Challah!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pull up on ‘em bitches, get out, walk
Way to many holes, like I play golf
She’s somewhere in Wayne’s world, stranded, lost
Bitch catchin' feelin’s like Randy, Moss
Young Money shit, got the bathroom door locked
Tune go hard, y’all softer than my car top
Hank Gathers, I’ma ball til my heart stop
Nice red bone in a thong and a bra top
Lookin' for a queen from a king-size bed
I can make that pussy stand up and drop dead
Fuckin’ with Lil Tune then a nigga get murked
A nigga get kilt like a muthafuckin' skirt
I do it like Nike, I’m psychic I knew you like it
Run up in ya ass, than I dash like a hyphen
This is priceless, not for sale
And I unveil, Ms. Shanell

[Hook: Shanell]
The feeling of your arms around me
I swear that I can’t get enough
I’m staying up all night, wishing you were here with me
And when I’m with my girls
They trippin’ cause it won’t be long
Before you have me rushing home


Cause, boy you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood

And when ya gone too long
I’m waiting with your T-shirt on
Playing love songs

You make me feel good
You tell me love is crazy
I guess that we are too
There ain't a thing I won’t do to prove that I’ll be here for you

[Verse 2: Drake]
You know I wake up like a king, get up, stunt
Take advantage of the day, this shit won't happen more than once
Know I’m ready for whatever, ready for the action
I’m still focused on my shit but girl I’m up for a distraction
Got a body like a stripper, but tell me she a student
But some strippers are students, so I tell her ass to prove it
Ya know, yeah show me all your books and some id or somethin'
I just wanna know that you can teach me somethin'


[Hook: Shanell]
Boy, you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood

Baby our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio (so turn it up)
Turn it up on your stereo
Cause Im dedicating this to you

Baby our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio (so turn it up)
Turn it up on your stereo
Cause Im dedicating this to you

Boy, you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood


(Young Mula Baby, Young Drizzy)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Falling too fast
Clearly rules don't apply
Can't believe that I just met you
You got me here
Watching minutes past by
Wondering when to expect you
There you go
Is this a dream?
Looking like every picture
That I've seen of you before
I've seen it all before

[Hook]
Now that it's over
I should of known better
Then you think this is real and
You could be mine
I should have known better
Slowed it down cause I feel
You needed time

[Hook]
But I kept thinking
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something


Maybe it's just nothing at all
But this could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something

Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all
Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all

I guess it's what we make it

I guess it's what we make it

I guess it's what we

[Verse 1]
Uh
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

[Chorus]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever, and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

[Post-Chorus]
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else

[Verse 2]
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

[Chorus]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

[Post-Chorus]
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else

[Verse 3]
The girl or the world? You see, someone gotta lose
I thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?
Night's fallin', lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear

[Chorus]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

[Post-Chorus]
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else




[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch I'm the baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate


[Intro: Drake]
Uh
Uh

[Verse 1: Drake]
It's 10 o'clock on a Wednesday and I know you're home
Driving up and down our street hoping that you'd come outside
Cause' I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me oohhhh
Childish as it seems it will make it all better, better
Selfish as it is this ain't' just about you noooooo
Did me wrong every time we were together, gether
And that's why

[Hook: Drake]
I'm gunna stunt, on, you
I'm gunna stunt, on, you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could've made it all on my own

[Verse 2: Jori Vague]
Oh Yes
Everything change but it's no different
But really it's like
Everything's the same but it's so different
I was always here when you needed me
Somehow I feel like you cheated me
I just wanted someone to believe in me
But you weren't there, you weren't there
You couldn't even make it to my first show
That's why I'm putting in this fucking work though
I'm becoming everything that I told you I'd be
I've been living like a bachelor no bachelor degree
I feel like the shit has ran it's course
I guess I never needed your support
Now let me hop out the motherfucking Porsche
Cause I'm gunna I'm gunna


[Hook: Drake]
I'm gunna stunt, on, you
I'm gunna stunt, on, you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could've made it all on my own

[Outro: Jori Vague]X2
You should've been patient
You should've waited
You should've been patient
You should've waited
I told you so
Told you my time was coming
But for you it's time to go



[Intro]
Uh yeah man, VO
Back again like we never left huh
I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh

[Hook]
(Yeah man; yeah)
You can't just love me like they do
(Talk to 'em V; I need somebody special in you girl)
I need someone special in you
(I know they out there somewhere dude; Ho!)
I know that out there theres a few
(Put ya hands up ladies; Yeah man)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
Can you help me?
(Uh)
She gotta be special
(Yea; You gotta hold me down baby)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
You gotta be special
(Yeah; You never know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
(Uh)
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 2: Drake]
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh

(Yea; uh)
You can just love me like they do
(Vo we back man; Its a beautiful thing dog)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; I'm looking for somebody special man I'm serious; Ho!)
I know that out there, theres a few
(I know that they out there man)
See I've been searching, I dont know what to do
(Ho! You gotta help me man)
Can you help me?
(Uh)
Special
(Uh; yea; I need you to hold me down babe)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
Gotta be special
(Yeah; You never really know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
Special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh

(Yep; ho!; Were makin history right now man)
You can't just love me like they do
(Yea; And you a legend for real, ima give you that man)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; Yea; I know they out there man)
I know that out there theres a few
(Ho!; Yeah uh)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
(You gotta help me baby)
Can you help me?
Special
(All around the world)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(From LA to VA)
Special
(Memphis Tennessee whats goin' on)
Cause you never know how people stick around
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yea my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Outro]
Vo and D-R[Outro]
Vo and D-R-A-K-E
We them boys that you came to see (so get busy ya'll)
Yep we take it to the same degree
So let loose since you came with me (get busy ya'll)
Vo, D-R-A-K-E
We them boys came to see (get busy ya'll)
Yeah we take it to the same degree
So let loose cause you came (get busy ya'll)-A-K-E
We them boys that you came to see (so get busy ya'll)
Yep we take it to the same degree
So let loose since you came with me (get busy ya'll)
Vo, D-R-A-K-E
We them boys came to see (get busy ya'll)
Yeah we take it to the same degree
So let loose cause you came (get busy ya'll)


Verse 1:
I’m going to be gone, this stink i gotta come up out it
I left my girl i didn’t know what I would do without her
You wondering what happened well we could sit and talk about it
But then this goes back to when i wasn’t to doubt her
This hurt the scouter is showing it’s over 9000
Vegeta, i needed her, was tired of pleasing her
And not myself
Add another failure unto my belt
I’m feeling welp I need to live with it
Miss me don’t dismiss me
Ain’t feeling nifty
I’m feeling fifty, your vibe is iffy
Flows is corny no jiffy
If you’re trying to hit me with them all slow blows
I’ll evade and get this over with quickly
Please sit me, down
The news got me white as a clown
Twitching like I got downs
Apparently the talk of the town
Not in a good way
New page turnt, loose bridge burnt
Tryna stay turnt, but pride has to be earned
Heh, weird looking at life in this position
If you’re listening this is different from that one chick I was kissing
The admission is pain and resentment
Can’t take the heat step out of the fucking kitchen
I feel like I’ve been missing for years
You hear, who else you know sounding like this
Lay and reminisce on all of the crimes that I committed
Needed glasses to see my vision (20/20)
To my followers I had to create some fission
I’m sad and angry Lord be my witness
Let me fire like a piston
To those who wish on my downfall, you tripping
Gripping with all that I have
Cooking up in this lab
Fed up with being a slave to my mind and my hand
You can laugh but it’s real
Do I heal or kill
Do I will or steal
Remember thoughts of me pulling the trigger with the steel
On myself and somebody else, but I’m stronger than that
To keel over it will take a lot more than just that
Let me scat, damn


(Drake ft Lil Wayne - Miss Me Hook/Outro)



[Part I]

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
That's what they doin', Cam'ron
They actin' like these singers, man
I ain't-I ain't goin' to the studio 'till I got a situation
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer
Who-who gonna be on the hook?
Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

[Verse 1]
Haha, damn
Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, "Where the check though?"
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left, ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though, voicemail say she ready though (Yeah)
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'Cedes Benz pedal
Doin' ninety on the bridge like, "Nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin up the angles, now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four, five chains, man the gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "The first mill' gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it, then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work, ayy

[Interlude]
Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

[Part II]

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I remember I had went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East 'cause them boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out, the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah
They did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, man
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

[Interlude]
Hear what?
Yo hear what, take time
(Ha, ha, ha) Ahh, no shit
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan fry skull
Him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van
You know Drizzy

[Chorus]
Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah
Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ayy)

[Verse 3]
I do better with the rider in my system
Ooh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy, peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't
I been had these visions of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we--

[Chorus]
Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, yeah, my niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, "Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—


[Chorus]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

Started from the bottom, now the whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
Cause we—

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga


[Bridge]
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame
Cause we—

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

(Iceberg)

Started from the bottom now we here
I got them bitches gettin naughty for some live house gear
Nigga go an light the blunt and let it smoke
My nigga tell us where you from and let the whole world know
Nigga started from the bottom got it without a handout
Now I smoke exotic and call models to lay em down
And still rockin bottles in honor of my uncles that got it doing the time That you had to be about it to get it
Instead of sittin on ur ass
To where you could lose ur whole life
Just by makin one bad move
Willin that fuckin rental like ur fuckin life depend on it
But it do
Cause if they catch u it the end homie
Started from the bottom now we on
During county got the whole world saying the word shown
Got the up north niggas sayin dat
Got some down south niggas bussin heads For a rack
But none of my niggas sufferin rise in the power
And all my niggas lovin it steady sliddin with rifles built
From goverments gettin high as the eiffel tower we buffin zips
Four fitfy gone on that grand daddy shit
Rubbin on a fat ass smokin the fatest spliff
Live life live nigga thats the motto
My stash lookin nice tryna getta alot mo that rasta power shit
Shittin on niggas I guess the money make my bowels shift

[Verse: Ydoc]

Started from the bottom now I'm somewhere in the middle
You don't need to understand I'm just thankful you're a fan
We can do this together, no matter what the weather
You turn it up a notch, till your freakin' speakers pop
Like everyday is different, I'm livin' on a mission
I'm 19 livin' off low paychecks, you can tell that I'm hungry
Always stayed home working, never went to parties, high school really never worked for me
Ah
Ahhhhh
Swear I kept it real from the start, with my team
Now my whole city thinking that I'mma star
Like its a new thing and dreaming is an old thing
I swear I run it when I visit, all these late night calls and all these late night texting
Its worth it
All my fans keep me working
The way they gloat about me, makes me seem so perfect
Good kid with good intentions ha
[I ain't lying in my verses i just hope y'all take care]

[Hook]
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team freaking here
Started from the bottom now we here

Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team freaking here
Started from the bottom

[Verse 2: TempOh]

Started from the bottom now we headin'
Straight to the top and I'm not about to stop
Because even all this hate that I'm getting
Can't get to my brain because I'm not one of the same as one of these lame ass kids
If I hit him would you miss, is he just another victim, or did you know the name of that kid
If you didn't know well
The name if my crew Purple Heart Gang

[Hook]

[Intro: Riff Raff]
Still sellin' drugs, I came through, still fuckin' with them thugs
Still sippin' drank, still sippin', bored now, I come -

[Hook 1: Riff Raff]
When my back's against the grain, money ain't a thang
Stackin' all this change got me flyin' private planes
Still sippin' drank, still sippin' drank...
Still sippin' drank, I'm still sippin' drank...
I'm still pullin' stars
Fuck around and I'm 'bout to pull Mars down
Pull it out the sky, 'sace on my eye
Oklahoma tie

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Popped up sober, Jody Highroller
Back in high school had a chip in front of my shoulder
But it's 2k13, still chasin' dreams
Done everything, got some diamonds on my rings
Range Rover aqua, break you off proper
Chop the block like a lobster, it's the freestyle doctor
Losin' ain't an option, haters can't stand me
I done broke a brick down on stage at the Grammys
Spilled syrup on my Dockers, break you off proper
Graduated hardwood degree, a martial artist
Hands-free phone, yep, I'm on my cordless
Neon boss, used to slang drugs
Fuckin' with them thugs got me not givin' a fuck
Versace shoulder shrug
Smokin' all these blunts got me buying new lungs

Riding round in this big old truck, bitch I'm from Texas
Shawty bad she don't give a fuck, no need to stress it

Labels call but I'm doing good, said you hear that blamin'
A million dollar chain, fuck that million dollar game
I won't stop till I'm in the top dirty and the thirty careless about the fame
I think it's time for me to stand out
Don't wanna hand out, just wanna make the music pop to it then jam out

So bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball to the day I fall, ball ball ball
Oh yes my bitches love me
Ohhh, yeah yeah ohhh, yeah yeah
I can give a fuck bout no hater as long as my bitches love me
Ohhh, yeah yeah ohhh, yeah yeah

Word up,whats on your mind word up
Baby girl you're fine, word up

*Lyrics from Snippets*

[Chorus: Drake]
You live a double life and your mouth run like you get two lives
You're loose with it
You know my Startrax niggas, they produce with it

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
...my buisness
Only take the pistol out your mouth to talk business, fuck niggas
I feel like Papa John's, I got a rocket launcher
I give you rocket science, I do math and slime


To my beloved fans, it truly breaks my heart that I won't be able to perform as planned at Wireless and Roskilde this weekend. I got sick a few days ago and although I am on my way to bouncing back, my doctors have made it clear that I am not physically fit to fly or deliver the performance my fans expect and deserve from me. I will be focused on resting for a quick recovery. I have the best fans in the world and I can't wait to come back to make more incredible memories together

[Intro: Drake]
Uh-uh, yeah
Uh

[Chorus: Drake]
I wanna be together, when they say that they know somebody better
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay—
And girl, I know you got your spies, when they happen to catch me in a lie
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I'm sorry that I'm super late
I was drivin' here jammin' them Lil Boosie tapes
Understand that I do not envision, I hallucinate
I'm the type of nigga you could never ever duplicate, but
Let's talk about the babies me and you could make
We could do it anywhere, baby, you just choose the place
I hope I'm not being inappropriate
But maybe if I peak under the table, you could show me it?
Let me get a quickie, speed stick, no deodorant
To cover up the smell 'cause your parents are the nosiest
When you famous all the bitches wanna throw you it
But even with a bunch of women, you could be the loneliest
I tend to ask more than I can give
Or wait whatever's next and just get bored of what it is
That's probably why I'm keepin' you around
Was looking for exactly what I found
I just hope you stay down


[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Drake]
Babygirl, I hope you rep for me for real
And when they get to stereotypin' a nigga
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
Listen, even if you slightly doubt me
When these bitches start to writin' books about me
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay—

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Everything about me cataclysmic
Big, obscure on every characteristic
I don't know what you're used to, but I'm a little different
Tremendous with credentials, resume is so prolific
Enough of that, despite I'm promisin' one in the booth
Always been a specialist at messin' with the best forbidden fruit
Never did I witness beauty so amazin', get it to the point when I see her, she glowin' like an angel with it
But after all the years of doin' it, I need an understanding with a woman good with followin' my lead
And though she finds it sexy and she loves that I'm the power, even in a crowded room, discreetly touching on her private
And when we goin' through a moment when we feelin' iffy
Believe in shit you hearin' while I question if you with me
You see that line of chicks? Let's go around the corner, waitin' and hopin' you drown, I just hope you stay down
I can't help the women lovin' everything about me, why you passin' judgement?
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
I know it's hard to trust me, all this money got my baby mama tryna fuck me
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—

[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
I ride for my niggas, dawg

Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Damn, life's so short
Fuck it, I don't wanna go to court (Huh!)
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though
Fuck it, I'm on the run for the month (Woo!)
I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil' niggas thuggin', even got me paranoid (Huh!)
I'm gettin' money, that's in any nigga category
Double M, I got Gs out in California (Huh!)

I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin' (Yeah), niggas tryna get at me, dawg
(Young Frankie Geechi Liberace, yeah)
I ride for my niggas


[Verse 2: Drake & Rick Ross]
It bothers me when the gods get to actin' like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don't be duckin' like you never wanted nothin'
It's feelin' like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from D.C., that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million-dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty Ms
Kobe my nigga, I hate it had to be him
Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym
(Huh! Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it," I'm tearin' holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix, and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em, "Butterfly it, she'll love it."
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin' my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fuckin' finish line; we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker gettin' mine off rap, with my niggas (Huh!)


[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas (Maybach Music)
I slide for my niggas, dawg (Dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas

[Verse 3: French Montana]
From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dawg (Huh)
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog (Huh)
Dwight Howard on the post, dawg (Huh)
My niggas got the powder through the post, dawg (Huh)
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head (Huh)
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the feds (Huh)
Ten grams off my last 250 now (Huh)
Big-ass crib, 250 down, damn!
Gave my nigga Max 7-5 (Huh)
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30 (Huh)
Fuck it, got me thinkin' like I'm 7-5 (Huh)
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30

[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
Huh, I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas (Maybach Music)
I slide for my niggas, dawg (Dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas

[Mackgee – Intro ]

Dawg!
Uh
Slide for my n******!

[Mackgee – Verse One]

Stay Scheming, raise demons
All you haters f**k yourselves face to face penis
Can’t do it like I do it they just stay dreaming
I’m the truest if it’s music, on the stage screaming
Back to back a couple Jordans like I made millions
Just some thousand dollars
Regular whip!
Got some mileage
Trying to plot on me, they treat me like a graph book
Barack Obama or depict me as a mad Bush
‘cause I’m ruling this
My music now got mega downloads, so you could say I’m doing swizz
Quick to holla if she look like Alicia Keys
A couple chains on me, looking like I’m Mister T
I got them thangs! on me, looking like I’m with police
But I’m not with the law; I don’t roll with the badges
I rep the green white green, now you know what the flag is
Polo beneath my jeans, it will show when I sag it
Trying to play me for a joke, all these n***** clueless
I make the desert storm; it’s nothing like fabolous music
What ’re you scheming for? I don’t see your reason
You claim you’re shooting like you’re Kobe I don’t see your season


[Mackgee - HOOK] X 2
Slide for my Ni***Z dawg!, ride for my Ni***z Uh!

[Mackgee – Verse two]

I’ve been trying all my life to fight my stomach growlings
My Pops told me that to be a man takes more than violence
I’m just trying to get a nut, like a couple almonds
My real ni***z stacking up, labor for allowance
But I’m kind ‘a imbalanced, when my paper’s deficit
Searching for a hustle, like another way to get at it
Tried to make a video, was looking for a camera guy
Took my money from me, left me nothing I was traumatized
F**k Jordan tower films, a couple bullets shower him, (fuck y’all ni***z)
A couple bullets shower him
F**k Jordan tower films, a couple bullets shower him…him
Couple bullets shower him!

[Verse 1:Trey songz]

Still...

Whipping the chevy, still getting my tipped licked
When I'm ready I still fall off intheparty like confetti
It's still mad rappers, D. Dot Angelettis
Still just as skinny as you met me
Still keep it real, never will let another disrespect me
For real, til deep in peace they rest me
Still smoke cess cause I swear that they stress me
And when I'm home a lot, keep the chrome a lot
Cause even when I'm home I'm knowin' there ain't a lot of dudes
That don't like the fact I'm blowin'
Like some running shoes on the track I'm goin'
Tell these other dudes they slack I'm sewin'
Don't get hemmed up, I think Timmed up
Cause in my mind it's the winter time all the time
I'm a grind
Tell em I'm a rhyme, told em that this sing got me signed
Try to put me in a box I will not stay there
And if I fall I will not lay there
Grown man, this is not daycare
A big boy game, they do not play fair
But I still keep it trill and I got this chair
Still uncomfortable if cops is there
My fam still dysfunctional, we not repaired
Still got rhymes out the asshole
Still wonder why are they mad for
Cause I'm in the hood like the crack-ho diesel
Ask yo people, Trey still do it for the people
Ride with some inter straps your whole fucking car is illegal
Still pick good over evil
Still play the Jesus and it's wild cause I'm still sinning
Addiction still weed-puffin, giving it to women
It's still my brain ready to bust up out my skull
To the mic, cause my mouth to be saying shit right
They saying shit like, I don't be killing it
You niggas is ridiculous, eat a dick or some syphilis
Die slow, still I done sucked it up
Drake tell em what the fuck is up


[Verse 2: Drake]
I used to cut the porch lights on
And now I cut the Porsche lights on
Just to let em know their foresight's wrong
Where this nigga going with that obscure ice on
He a lame, I'm tryna get my mature life on
I asked what happen, or whats hattenin', hattenin'
Hop up out the passenger and help me back the phantom in
Damn, I never got to use that in a convo
Never got the chance to put you back in a condo
And, and, it couldn't be more true
I always meant to get you that villa in Corfu
Women I pass off, and money I tore through
Now all I really need is the number before 2
Is it over, tell me it isn't over
They told me it was easy as I get a little older, yeah right
And this is what my life outro sound like
Even though Dre did it this shit don't sound right
I was, born to do it, born to make bomb music
I flow tight like I was born Jewish
Well, actually I was born Jewish
I guess at this point you could say I was born foolish (ha)
Yea, what about the grammy's and the bubbly
What about all my fans that be loving me, I
Used to chill in them spots where the trouble be
But never ended up in that menage at the Double Tree
What about that girl Rita down in Basque
In L.A Swear I would of never cheated on your ass
But you ain't give me yo number cause them niggas got to fighting
Situation got me thinking and that's when I got to writing, hmm...
Change these hundreds for me cashier
Cause I ain't made it but I'm better off than last year, yeah
And what it look like hun'
I never got to make it rain but it look like fun
And, uh, a king is what I'm fit to be
I don't get these niggas, they a mystery
I mean they talk so quiet as if it its private
And they don't ever bring that shit to me, but
Man I ain't live life so wrong
I said fuck a couple dudes, cause I ain't like yo song
Least let me tell you why I'm this way
Hold on...



[Chorus]
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still

[Verse]
Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin' bottles cuz it's ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin' and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shoulda won that
Nelissa and Wristpect, Man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin', ex-girls bickerin'
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'd take a minute if you're listenin'
Please start doin' you, I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin' me
My brother P-Reign knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver and 40, man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P-Plus
The names I mention are crucial; you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes
I could sacrifice a line like (mumbles)
Yeah, haha, I swear I really fuckin' does it
I had these niggas trippin', no luggage

[Chorus]
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still

I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I’m blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?

[Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever
Four page letters, and time is all better
‘Cause time heal whatever
Ima need a moment ’cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, Females are on a regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friend with benefits till we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like “one more chance”, more problems no biggie ah
It’s all good don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give eachother space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that (all that)
Tell your friends they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?

[Drake]

[Tyga]
Uh, ain’t no, ain’t nobody like you

I ain’t the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Uh, still a, still a superfreak
You know how it be when I’m rolling in the sheets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Genuine, ’cause I’m the same O G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies
Arguing in Barney’s, fly shit, too much pride to say sorry
Problems ruined like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave, but she wanna stay
She like, how you feeling babe?
Like, like, shit

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ain't nobody like you
Heard you got a ballplayer
But he don't excite you
I ain't the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Still a superfreak
You know how I be when I'm rolling in the streets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Ginuwine cause I'm the same Ol' G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies, arguing in Barney's, fly shit
Too much pride to say sorry
Shit, problems running like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave but she wanna stay
She like "how you feeling babe?"
Like, shit

[Intro]
I feel good, I can't even sing but I'm gonna try
Sike
Maybe you can call in sick
Bring it to the room and get all this dick

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, I still got that voice that will make you go insane
I've been thinking about you Frank Ocean Novacaine
I get you wetter than the streets when it's pouring rain
And we can stay home like high school on snowy days
You know the name if not, then that don't even matter
I'm always on the run like I got a leaky bladder
I'm the shit like fecal matter
You don't trust me, I wonder why, cause I'm a freaking rapper?
Read the chapter baby don't ignore me
Or watch the show when it's Boy Meets World, Topanga I'll be Cory
I apologize if this seems kinda corny
But I got these teenage hormones, I'm kinda horny
That kind of stuff will probably make you wonder
Do I like freaky girls like Gucci and get them in a hummer
I probably do but just listen honey
That's probably true but just listen honey

[Hook: Drake]
I feel good, I got some time off girl it's been so long
Did you have fun, cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I'm blunt but how real is that
You want this feeling back, well you should know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go, it's better than you know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go, it's better than you know

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
Yo, I still got all of these feelings I've been keeping
Never showed emotion to these chicks that I was freaking
I be missing you like every single weekend
I know you got my voicemails, never kept it a secret
And if you speechless let me tell you what it really is
I'm a changed man, used to be a silly kid
Listen to the rumors, things I never really did
Always tell the truth, never fake, see I really [?]
Shit, I see you trying to do your own thing
But just tell me if you miss me too
I wasn't ready for commitment back then
But now I'll let you tie me down, something like a tennis shoe
And now I got bread I could grow, we can go do some things that we don't normally get to do
So got a thing for me, I'll let it [?] if you tell me that it isn't true

[Hook: Drake]
I feel good, I got some time off girl it's been so long
Did you have fun, cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I'm blunt but how real is that
You want this feeling back, well you should know
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go, it's better than you know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go, it's better than you know
I still


[Intro]
Doin' well, dog
Yeah, me and all my
Yeah, me—yeah

[Chorus]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 1]
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where yo bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know

[Chorus]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog


[Verse 2]
Oh, and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hitting like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Six-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it, then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the door's open, and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

[Chorus]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still—

[Outro]
Wow, all praise to the most high up...



[Intro: Gucci Mane (DJ Drama)]
Bustas! (I know) Gansta Grillz, bastards! (I know)
(It's not fair, I agree, I totally agree, it's not!)

[Pre-Hook: Gucci Mane (DJ Drama)]
It's Gucci! (hahaha) What's happening? Burr!
DJ Drama, what's happening? (Mr. Thanksgiving) Gansta Grillz
Gucci! Drizzy Drake and Gucci

It's Gucci! What's happening? (I'm shivering!) Burr!
DJ Drama, what's happening? (Ya know what I mean?) Gansta Grillz
Gucci! Drizzy Drake and Gucci

It's Gucci! What's happening? Burr! (Guccimerica!)
DJ Drama, what's happening? (We've read this) Gansta Grillz
Gucci! Drizzy Drake and Gucci

Ha! (1017) They ain't expect this one
Expect the unexpected motherfucker
It's Gucci!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
From Zone Six to the SWATS, I'm a keep the block burnin'
Long as the world keep turnin', money I'm gon' be earnin (hah)
Lost my train of thought, if someone find it, return it
You niggas wanna beat me like my children, I'm hearin' (shh)
You come between my paper route, that's pass interference
Now cash interference, I shine just like my earrings (bling)
It's $50 K today, twelve bars, a feature appearance
My sneaker bill cost more than what you make in a year, man
Don't near man, there's no one near man, you're like a cheer man
No coachin', Gucci the GM and you're the beer man
Don't try me like I'm a pussy another tin man
I rap I bust bricks so you can call it R&B man
Gucci!

[Bridge: DJ Drama]
I got a new side job, I'm hip-hop security
And what that means is I'm takin' all credentials
What you say and what you do, accomplishments, accolades
I'm like the airport, all identification will be checked
Drama!

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, uh, feelin sorry for the runner up
I'm still away gettin money when the sun is up
And they keep sayin how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie starters can't put the numbers up
Maann, hate is so pasé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day, nigga
And it's just me and my money, ya'll don't even get to play when ya'll are leading by twenty
Yeah, I infiltrated the game, I was hesitant at first and feared what it would change
Now I'm high of the success and faded off of the fame
But still I managed to keep all of my opinions the same
Man, I am So Far Gone, bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than santa inside rockin nauta wear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killin shit, I'm killin shit
Shoutout to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah, from the beginning to the end
Know I'm into making history, not into making friends, motherfuckaa

[Bridge: DJ Drama]
I've seen a lot come and go
Some niggas was runnin too fast, ran outta breath too quick
Us over here? We pace ourselves, the finish line is way far ahead
You niggas keep gettin cramps in the race, don't pass out, baby!
Look for me in the rafters!

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Mike bigga baby, it's bigger baby, Gucci, Louis, Prada
Don Dada, I am hot as the Sahara
What I spit in my saliva is a flow hotter than lava
When I grab a microphone, I flame on like Waka Flocka
Got a thirty-eight revolver that I call my problem-solver
I ain't worried bout no rappers, they just talk, they just holler
When that fire hit their ass, they'll walk, they crew will follow
Like a pimp, I pop my collar, at the prospect of tomorrow
Naw said life a bitch, so I'm a break her for some dollars
I will never be a simple, sorry, sucka stuck in squalor
I will murder ever verse I ever versed to get the guala
I am cursed since I first dispersed a dime bag of rocka in exchange for a dollar

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Ay, to all you other rappers out there
If I'm not eatin with ya, and you have an opinion about me
Always remember how insignificant your opinion is to the world
Whether you like, or dislike me, tomorrow's coming
So with that said, get on your grind, because it's about time, bitch!


Street Lights Never Fade
By Studrique
Prod. by J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

[Verse 1]

This is no second chance, this right here's a letter
I was gonna send it later but now is better
It was set for delivery at graduation
I'll recite it now to clear my reputation
You think I'm lonely, Akon wants his girl back
But that's not the reason I wrote this rap
Me and you have definitely grown from that
I just want to break the ice, Titanic cracks
Want to say in many ways you inspire me
Handling your business like a boss, not employee
The way we cared for each, listened careful
Sacrificing time living now and not for later
This is something I gotta get off my chest
Even though we moved on I still hope for the best for you
I'm a guy who can keep his distance
But my respect for you is a truth I can't resist

[Verse 2]

Not often but when I do reminisce
It's on how we ran the world with an iron fist
On how you were protected by the walls you built
The way your mind was high above my cries of guilt
You stayed rational when I was a heartless wreck
Picked up the broken pieces like a skateboard deck
Worth it in the end the fights we fought
Even though the way it ended was not my thoughts
Appreciate your act of acceptance
The closure help my stance, my independence
You have this finesse that is under minded
By your willingness to keep everything aligned
Get what I'm saying? All your acts of kindness
Give sight to those who suffer blindness
The feeling now is mutual
Grew a goatee for someone that I used to, know
For sure you got my back still like plan b
When your name pops up it enlightens me
Knowing your heart is strong enough to carry on still
You singing voice enough to set off the fire drill
I'm getting trembles just by typing this out
I hope you realize who I'm talking about
I'm not wishing for us to be as one
I just hope you listen to this when your practice is done


[Verse 3]

Above it all I want to show you gratitude
Not many people can handle my attitude
Conversations sailed fluid with a ship afloat
We built on a conversation from Death Note
The night we walked down Bell Air
Had the street lights glisten glee from out of your hair
And when we talked again about a year ago
I knew our maturity was at a steady growth
While my thoughts for you are out in the open
I have a reassurance that nothing is broken
We'll never talk in the current world
But you'll stay in my heart as the one girl
That listened

[Outro: Drake]

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I have to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient and waited to long
But I woulda came back, but I woulda came back for you
Woulda came back, woulda came back

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
It's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But


[Hook: Nickelus F]
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 2: Drake]
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a "nigga"
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist


[Hook: Nickelus F]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna question half the places Nick been

[Hook: Nickelus F]



[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (yeah)
If I ever disappear (look), best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again (yeah)
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 1: Drake]
I tell her, I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who is he?"
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better than your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully live to see what they say that I'm gon' be
And if not then I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet than to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane, pick a lane, that's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve, without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah, the Chris Paul of this fall
Sittin' this tall, I float high, goodbye, I will miss y'all

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear (yeah), best believe I'm comin' back
Stunt hard (I'm leanin')
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
If I don't do nothin', I'mma stunt my ass off
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil
You can't get on my level cause I am so unleveled
I'm a young rebel and I got a babyface
I need a young Pebbles, I need a stunt double
Yeah, me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles
Yeah, I stick my landin' in a freak drawers
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes
Yeah, but I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O, yeah
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious
Yeah, I'm on the cup of that tilt
And if you hatin' on me I'll say fuck you like wilt
Yeah! I'm a wilderbeast. You're just a wildebeest
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace
Yeah! Talkin big big shit
I am rude, I take food from a kid picnic nigga
Yeah and we can bang like bumper cars
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars, haha

[Chorus: Drake & Nutt Da Kid]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (haan)
If I ever disappear ('bout time)
Best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard (they'll know)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (yeah, okay)
All I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 3: Nutt Da Kid]
I stunt hard, I stunt harder
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans
I ball hard, So I'm a ball hogger
And I go hard in my dunk like Vince Carter
I hustle harder, I live in the Carter
I think forward, all I see is tomorrow
I need meat I'll turn your shop into a horror
So if you tryin' to see more, better feed me
I'm back on my grizzy like "Izzy" after "gr"
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur
And the feds will never get me like a backwards password
Black spur, ghost I'm like Pacman, Casper
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister
Ask her, am I her man? Her answer is yessir
Shit, I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA 'bout a quarter a day
Now tell them bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear, best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again, all I ever do is stunt hard


[Intro: Drake]
(Dramatic, nigga!)
Well, alright, here I go

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm a rapper-turned-singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal cords, all I hit is C-notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if I'm pre-voked
I'm about to change the fucking game, pass the remote
Money is everything, and it's every other thing
I'm part of the choir, that's the motto that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are postgame
MoneyOverBitches dot com, check the domain
It's coming too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, "Yeah, once in a blue moon"
Oops, I mean a red moon, I did it again, Tune
Let me leave a space in for your Blood affiliation, I state
Heavy metaphors, flow so overweight
I could rap around these other young'un's like a cobra snake
Frostbite Drizzy, nigga, nobody as cold as Drake
Keep your ass in-line, don't be tryna roller skate
Fuck all the discrete shit, I get on some deep shit
I am 21, tell me, who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you could tell I'm real
'Cause I'm gettin' hood love and I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young Angel, Young Lion, I'm done tryin'
I'm just doin', who's drinkin'? 'Cause I'm buyin'
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' Jon B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This for all the strippers 'cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell 'em, "Back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it"
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back-and-forth faxes
My money coming full circle, get up on my axis
Nebby, I'ma kill 'em, only 'cause I promised
They think I'm bein' cocky, but I'm only bein' honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party 'less I got some bottles in the booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just havin' patience, 'cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, Drizzy


[Interlude: DJ Drama]
(Gangsta!) I just want y'all to remember
That this is the first mixtape you bumped
While you had a Black president

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, p-p-pass the dro
I am such a beast and you can ask them hoes
And they might even say you should leave me alone
And homie's scared, 'Cause his bitch like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy, I tote that boom-bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I ain't talkin' marbles, you can pluck my balls
And yes, I'm fallin', but up, I fall
And if your bitch in heat, she could fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin' to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter, Carter, ball harder
Ten girls, penthouse suite, y'all order
Whatever y'all please: wine, crackers, and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my tees
The supplement I've taken got me feelin' mighty
My gun and money don't split, call that shit Siamese
Yes, my watch make the frickin' time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap-ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And 18 G's is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know 'bout it? My niggas so about it
If you kill everybody, they can't go to court about it
Weezy, I ignore the liars, baby, I ignite the fire
I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy, obviously, pop one at your Ivy League
I don't have a rivalry, if so, you'll have a cah-sualty
Oops, I meant "a casualty," oops, I meant catastrophe"
Oops, I meant, actually, you niggas is just ass to me
And big, wet pussy is more like what I'm rather-ing
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying
Or I hang you on the wall like a art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money
I got Cash Money, I got Young Money, bitch (Gangsta!)


[Outro: DJ Drama & Lil Wayne]
See, I told y'all it'd be well worth the wait, right?
Dedication 3!
Chris, fuck with me!
C'mon, it's Mr. Thanksgiving you're talking about
Thing's for sure



[Verse]
It's 10 O'clock on a Wednesday and I know your home
Drivin up and down your street
Hopin that you'll come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me
Childish as it seems, it'll make it all better, better
Selfish as it is, this just ain't about you no
Did me wrong every time we were together, -gether
And that's why
I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could've made it all on my own




"Ist das Mic jetzt an, Conny?"
"Das geile ist, dass man dich auch auf der Aufnahme hört"

[Verse 1]
Manchmal frag ich mich, wieso ich immer noch rap
Ist wie Parfum sprühen über einen Kotzfleck
Auf deinem Lieblingspulli, doch er bleibt
Ich dachte Null wird mein bestes Album, doch, wer weiß
Vielleicht ist es der Anfang von was Großem
Oder das Ende von was kleinem, ich kann mich nicht entscheiden
Ich lieg um zwei Uhr nachts wach auf meiner Couch
Und denke: wann wachst du endlich auf?
"Schachmatt" - Schreit mir das Leben aus dem Nebenraum zu
Ich lenk es ab und stell meinen König schnell von E2 auf A8
Passanten fragen immer: "Markus, warum leuchtest du?"
Ich sage: "Ich gehöre nicht zu euch dazu"
Ich gebe mein Talent den Hunden zum Fraß
Mich auf, dich auch, kein Fick drauf
Ob meine Musik einer deiner hundert Kumpels mag
Ich nehm sie nur für dich auf, mich auch

[Hook] (Drake - Successful)
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2]
Eigentlich will ich gar nicht unbedingt erfolgreich sein
Doch umso älter ich werde, lässt man mich fühlen, ich sollte es sein
Naja, dann werd ichs halt
Manche sterben jung, manche sterben alt, manche sterben nie
Ich will meine Fresse nicht (nicht) unbedingt auf Titelblättern sehen
Mir reichts oft auch schon, wenn ich im Spiegel Maeckes seh
Muss es da auch noch auf dem Spiegel sein?
Ein ganz klares: ja! Bums, fallera
Stein für Stein stell ich auf, für mich ganz allein, ein ganz normaler Soziopath
Der sich freut, wenn möglichst viel vor allen Leuten zusammenfällt
Willkommen zu Maeckes-Dominotag
Manchmal denk ich, unser ganzes Leben ist 'ne Show von Mario Barth
Alle anderen amüsieren sich, ich nicht
Angesichts der Scheiße für die manche noch Eintritt zahlen
Heute schau ich mir ne Show von Maeckes an
Der Rest ist Barth

[Hook] (Drake - Successful)
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 3]
Null ist das Tor in eine andere Welt
Uns egal, was  allen anderen gefällt
Wir sind der singende und tanzende Abschaum der Welt
Jeder hat kaum noch Geld
Doch wir sind trotzdem drei mal so voll wie unser Kühlschrank
Und wir leuchten heller als der Rest mit ausgeglichenem Gemütszustand
Schließ die Augen, fühlst du es dann?
Wie du die Müdigkeit übermannst?
Die Füße im Sand, der Kopf im Smog
Obgleich du dachtest Null wird mein bestes Album, doch, wer weiß?
Ich gebe mein Talent den Hunden zum Fraß
Es langweilt sie, sie haben Zeit Ihres Lebens daran rumgenagt
Wenn ich mir den Kopf wegschieß, wachsen zwei neue nach
Ich feier meinen Erfolg im Grab
Zeit, dass ich weniger sag
Ich bin nicht Maeckes, nur sein chinesisches Plagiat

NULL!

[Hook] (Drake - Successful)

Heute habe ich gemerkt, dass ich nicht perfekt bin


[Intro: Trey Songz]
The money (Money), cars (Cars)
The clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
Yeah

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 1: Drake]
Drizzy
Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it


[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2"
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:


[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude]
Alright well, um, alright. We... we'll fuckin' figure it out. You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it, you know, makin' it to the top. All the way to the top. Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 3: Drake]
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me "Shoppin' Bag Drizzy"
Or call me Mr. "Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?"
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...


[Chorus: Trey Songz & Drake]
Yeah, I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be (Yeah), I just wanna be successful (That's all I want, man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (You gotta tell 'em, Trey)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude: Drake]
Yeah, it's like I, it's like I know what I gotta say
I just don't know... how to say it... to you

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pardon the swag, but bitch, it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearin' bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, ain't that a female dog?
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell, "God"
Weezy Baby, I go re-al hard
No further details, boy



[Intro: Dennis Graham]
Alright, well, um, alright
We, we'll fuckin' figure it out
You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it
You know, makin' it to the top
All the way to the top
Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? Hahahahahahaha
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse: Drake]
Part of me wish that I could meet with all you haters in person
They got a lot of feelings for me they just ain't certain
How to express themself when I walk into the club
And take stares like the fuckin elevators ain't workin', yeah
'Cause they know the promoter paid you
You wouldn’t have come if someone hadn’t of made you
You just lookin' forward to seein' woman that played you
And shittin' on the men they get engaged to
I swear it’s like, uh
More confidence and less fear
We can discuss it further when y'all manage to get here
Diddy here, O here, Skinny here, Rex here
And we just havin' one of those conversations 'bout next year
I'ma kill it I promise this how I know you mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much all I want is the

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Drake]
(Yeah) I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be (Yeah), I just wanna be successful (That's all I want, man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (You gotta tell 'em, Trey)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah
And I don't know if I can do that with you, you know, so




[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Yup!
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Drizzy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Aww yeah Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough will solve ya problems, too much will kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here

I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I want the money, money, money, I want a whole lot of that
Cause all the honey's, they ask me where the dollars at
Where your head at? Tell me 'bout your scholar cap
Tryna find a way, but you never got a map
Dream chaser, risk taker
No favor, don't hate us
They might want me to drown
Holdin' me down but the throne and the crown
Is all I ever wanted, all I ever needed
If I'm the only one then don't nobody else believe it
Then keep it a secret and watch me achieve it
Cause I know what I want now!
So if you want the money, if you gotta make it
You the only one and don't nobody else believe it
Then tell 'em to beat it and watch you achieve it
Sing it if you want!

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left somethin' in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2"
And 48 hours all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got po'd up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantoms leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress is like a dead end
My girl love me but fuck it, my heart beat slow

And life change for us every single week so
It's good but I know this ain't the peak though

I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
The oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (yeah, that's all I want man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (you gotta tell 'em, Trey)
Whoa-oh-whoa, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful




[Verse 1: Drake]
Part of me wished I can meet with
All you haters in person, they got a lot of
Feelings for me they just ain't certain. How to
Express themselves when I walk into the club and

Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Hip-hop is like school, yeah I had to
Learn it. Beef is like a blank disc, yeah
I had to burn it. They finally showing me
Respect but I had to earn it. I'm heading to
The finishing line, ain't got no time for
U-turns. Today I realise that I'm not perfect
Everything I did to get here wasn't really worth it
Why won't they just let me be great. You fall down seven
Times you stand up eight. Realise true happiness lies
Inside of you. Everyday give yourself a mental shampoo
The birds singing after the motherfukin` storm gone. If you
Want to sing, you can always sing this song. Turn my swag
On, this my theme song, there`s 95 per-cent chance that I used to
Be your ringtone. I got swissel and cheese but I don't yodel
Heart tatted on my neck they love my vocal

[Hook: Trey Songz]

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
As I sit back and spit this crack and leaking
On the internet and watch my haters react
50 said they can't read between the lines so
I jab, uppercut, punchline after punchline
I know you thinking damn Soulja going hard
Right now. And I'm thinking damn this is just the
Start right now. Soulja Boy is going on a renegade
If life give you lemons make lemonade

[Hook: Trey Songz]

[Outro: Soulja Boy]
Uh, no one person on this earth can change their past
But every single person on this earth can start today
And change their future. That`s real shit. Beezy
Soulja Boy I tell 'em

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

[Verse 2]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying


[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)

You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had

Mais, moi, j'ai la rage, ma vision du Rap, elle est rare
Tant qu'un misérable s'endormira dans la rame
Pendant que le rat se réchauffera sur les rails

Can't stop the feeling !

I can't feel my face when I (Just dance dance dance dance)

Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation




[Chorus]
I think you're changin' your mind
Startin' to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now I'd rather know ahead of time
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see you likin' someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

[Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 2]
I kept it decent, I kept you sane
I kept it peaceful, don't lie
I kept it decent, even the secrets
Kept it between you and I

[Bridge]
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea- brea

[Chorus]
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done




[Chorus]
I think you're changing your mind
Starting to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now, I'd rather know ahead of time

How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

[Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusin' me
Don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started, and we're already done

[Verse 2]
I kept it decent

Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking
Looking
Looking

[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Verse 1: Drake]
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon’ really feel it now
I’m out here…

[Verse 2: Drake]
All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here?
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six, soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…

[Intro: Majid Al Maskati]
Ooh, baby, yeah

[Verse: Majid Al Maskati]
Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same

[Outro: Majid Al Maskati]
Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know

[Verse 1: Lenny Kravitz]
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower
In a world that’s crumbling, all around us everyday
You are, all the inspiration that I need to find my way
How long I’ve been yearning, for the day I find my one true love
Now that you are here my darling, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)

[Hook : Lenny Kravitz]
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower

[Verse 2: Lenny Kravitz]
Whenever you call me, I’ll be there with no delay, my love
Even when I’m miles away girl, my heart will be there (I’ll be right there)
Any conversation that you want to have, you’ll have my ear
You can tell me all your secrets, they’ll be safe my dear

[Hook : Lenny Kravitz]
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower

[Verse 3: Drake]
I’m not that good with words, but I’m a try my best
Look, I don’t wanna ever make you mad girl
I just wanna have you see you know the things young men are hesitant to have girl
A little you a little me and someone else, good lord that’s a winner right there
But we really got a story to tell, it can’t finish right there
I used to wonder what my old girl doing right now
Ever since you came into my life
Everytime I think it’d be good to call her
I just think about you and it’d make me think twice, ah yeah
Yeah, I know we’ve been through a couple things
You know a couple things, what are we to do
But you make me feel good, cause you love me for me and you love me for you
Come on

[Hook : Lenny Kravitz]
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright (it’s gon be alright)
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower


[Chorus]
Have it my way, them bullets coming for your ass lik' tupe it's the superbowl

[Verse 1]
What would you do if I needed more cash, What would you do if I needed a bus pass, would say "Who me, get up and pay your fare" is that you walking or is that the money talking

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

*will be available when released as second single from ‘certified lover boy’*

[Intro]
I been waitin' on this
Yeah

[Verse]
All of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces, but there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a—
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my 'Malis pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to— Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
RIP my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself

[Intro: Drake & M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Right
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Haaaah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us


[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh
Are you listening? Is anybody listening?
Walk into the room and you can smell the Clive Christian scent
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrilling bars, you'd think I'm writin' with John Grisham pen
I need rosé, never mind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom, no license
Fuck if you feelin' me as long as your wife is
No one in my city got a pocket like Drizzy
I could rock fitted jeans 'cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentals
And, Ms. Wrong, sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck y'all rappers and your self-proclaimed status
I can only see green now, happy St. Paddy's
Yeah, I know you waitin' on the last quote
Check the SoundScan, you can see that I'm the last hope

[Chorus: M.I.A. & Drake]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Oh, I'm not done

Ye, what up?
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Don C, what up, homeboy?
No one on the corner has swagger like us
G-hop
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
I got 'em
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Uh
Look


[Verse 2: Drake]
By the way, I'm Jewish
And turnin' 22 gets depressin' when you see your favorite rappers goin' through it
Tryna reinvent themselves, showin' no improvement
Gettin' crushed by this light-skinned youngin on some new shit
40, just record it and we'll drop this here
'Cause I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
You in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Yeah, fuck you really know about a Eames couch?
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake but a nigga livin' ya dreams out
Lookin' like a photoshoot every time the team's out
Yeah, and is the realest nigga still I?
A woman could love me to death but I still die
So I'm about us now
Smith and Wesson flow, you should tell them boys duck down

[Chorus: M.I.A. & Drake]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Yeah
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
You know what it is
No one on the corner has swagger like us

[Hook]

Oh, she say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
I say why don't we make an agreement then
We can just, while we being friends
Oh
Girl I know you wanna
I know you wanna, yeah

[Verse]

Party at the cribbo
Only wanted you here, not all of you friends though
In the feels so I'm never doing cheap shit
Doing what I can, I'mma show you that I mean shit

This ain't a love ballad, but I'm so dumb founded
Too much green, got too much salad
In the bong, feeling wrong, I just wanna be right though
Like I'm an iPhone fixing all the typos

Walking on a tightrope, will I fall down?
You can go Geico, but I'mma ball out
That 10% is like everything that I meant is like everything I gave is like everything I did

And if I never see a dollar then fuck it
Keeping with the rap like you kept me the comfort
Sometimes things are hot like an oven
But other times like I'm taking face full of knuckles

One, two, punch
I been up too much
I been stuck on you
I been fucked up drunk for a minute

I'm just kinda wondering if I can win it

Slurred words are still there
It's hurts but sure, you know that I still care
So I'mma pound these shots, these dudes pounce on thot
But my sights set, I might get, my one chance and (and, and)

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Girl, I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Girl, I know you wanna

She know she working with the nana
And she wanna give me the adunana-ne, ohh

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

If you oblige me, I'll hang it up, and I'll never come out of retirement
You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt me
It would be different without me
What is it without me
Don't go do nothing without me
This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi
I swear my life stories better than stories they tellin' 'bout me
They got it twisted
Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going the distance
And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with him?
Maybe you just had to realize
That  knowing the difference can make all the difference
She wanna run me that adanunana
Yeah she keep giving me looks



[Pre-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)
I mean look at that bitch
She looked at my wrist and she couldn’t resist

Pull up like Jordan
I'm ballin', whenever I shoot it goes swish

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Roller extension
I need no connections
I pay attention
But I do not pay for attention
Cause she know I got a check

These bitches wanna bop me yeah
Champagne tsunami yeah

[Pre-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)

She looked at my wrist and she couldn’t resist
Back to back one, pop a bottle how could you resist

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Pull up like Jordan
I'm ballin', whenever I shoot it goes swish
Roll up another one
Pull me another one

Every time that I take a shot I swear I never miss

[Verse: Drake]
(These niggas be mad now)
You thought I would stay so complacent
But that shit was not on my next shit, ay na
Fuck it look [?] they hating
[Out to the wating I toss in their faces]
Already just knew that I got it, this
I need a monument for my accomplishments
[Banking accounts with my conglomerates]
I am not swayed by the consequence
Drop to the beat like i’m Yeezus
Won't waste my time or my money [?]
Forever I’m King and my bitch she be Queen
And she know I got D for her
Imma be me till I leave
Tell her hold that, this game gon cost some fee
Swishin’ I swish , what it’s like to be me
Swiping I swipe, mother fuck being cheap
I got kush in my wallet I'm zoned by the weed
Never gon stop and I put that on me
Conquered my craft now I’m stuck on repeat
I got to eat till my pockets obese

[Bridge: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
These niggas be mad now
(These niggas be mad when you make it (x2))
These bitches be mad now
(These bitches be mad when you make it(x2))
They full on that jealousy

[Pre-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)
I mean look at that bitch
She looked at my wrist and she couldn’t resist
Back to back one, pop a bottle how could you resist
Pull up like Jordan
I'm ballin', whenever I shoot it goes swish

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Roll up another one
Pull me another one
I want another one
Every time that I take a shot I swear I never miss
I love it, I’m winnin', I’m feenin the game
Ain’t got no assists

[Verse 3: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I’m on a whole different level
I need me a whole different bedroom
When you don’t got it boy how can you sell it
Always on go, my foot down on the pedal
Spending my money that shit just keep flowing
She popped her some pills now that bitch is just rolling
Roll up another one we just keep going
I hope that she ride me the same in the morning

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I couldn't resist (I couldn't resist)
I mean look at that bitch
She looked at my wrist and she couldn’t resist
Back to back one, pop a bottle how could you resist
Pull up like Jordan
I'm ballin', whenever I shoot it goes swish

[PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Roll up another one
Pull me another one
I want another one
Every time that I take a shot I swear I never miss
I love it, I’m winnin', I’m feenin the game
Ain’t got no assists

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna & Drake]
'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you, instead, they say

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost




[Chorus]
Know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
Because I’ve loved and I’ve lost

[Verse 1]
I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change and I still feel the same
A life with no fun, please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Because that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run with that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the parties over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Chorus]
Know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
Because I’ve loved and I’ve lost

[Verse 2]
It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Because you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Because your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know

[Chorus]
Know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
Because I’ve loved and I’ve lost

[Outro]
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost

Keep running through my mind, jog my memories; amnesia
Touch ya, tease ya, nervous?
Don't freeze up She let me take control, I run a woman like a Visa
She always run back to me saying he's a Dog off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her take a breather
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches
But money's over her Cause money's under nothing
My life is such a blur
It's not the way it has to go, it' just what I prefer
And any Young Money nigga I know would concur
Weezy talk to 'em!

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]

She stressin', ya she testin' ya, she just tryin' to see what kinda level ya on
You don't make it bounce like a basketball, you ain't even get no ass at all

[Intro: Drake & Static Major]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, hey there, help me
I've been away too long and I know you'd agree
I'm so tired, but I can't sleep
My door's open and that don't mean leave
Know what I mean?

[Chorus: Aaliyah & Drake]
Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me (oh shit)
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Boy, you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

[Verse 1: Static Major]
Don't rush, but don't wait
Don't talk 'cause it's gettin' late
Sit right here, next to me
What's up? Your talk is cheap


[Chorus: Aaliyah]
Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Boy, you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

[Verse 2: Drake]
You know I gotta ask—
What's up with the friends that you bring?
Know you got some other cool friends that you never bring
New stories for you every time the phone ring
They don't understand, girl if anything you're everything
Oh lord, good lord, smoke a little, then record
You know Papi on the vocals, 40 on the boards
Call me when you feel inspired, never when you're bored
And have a real conversation with your fuckin' boy
With the fuckin' man, Mr. Lover-Lover-Man
How come everything is always on the other hand?
How come you ain't never busy when I'm busy
But the moment that I'm free
You always end up with some other plans?
How you make a good dude wait so long?
I don't understand why, that's some girl shit
And what you doin' in the bedroom with your clothes on?
I want you wearin' what you came into the world with


[Chorus: Aaliyah & Static Major]
This is your chance to prove that you got the skill
Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
You said you could give me the chills
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Well it's all up to you
Boy you gotta push my buttons
But you don't know what to do
The ones that turn me on, turn me on

[Outro: Aaliyah + Static Major]
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Hey, woo!
Girl this very, very moment, yeah
Yeah, yeah



[Chorus: Drake]
I don't know if what we have is love, but it's on my mind
We might slide on a nigga inside this club, girl, close your eyes
Fifteen brothers, no friends when I pull up, for peace of mind
Lights come on, I'ma need you to come find me, don't be so shy

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Drakeo the Ruler]
'Cause I know you want me, girl
'Cause I know you want me, girl
'Cause I know you want me, girl
'Cause I know you want me, want me girl (I know you want me)
'Cause I know you want me (Shit)
'Cause I know you want me, girl (They all want me)

[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
Don't be shy, I got killers with me, stupid
I march with sticks, I ain't worried bout no groupies
I know you want me 'cause your BD is a goofy
Boss you up, your lifestyle could be exclusive
But I don't know, 'cause you be hangin' 'round with losers
Internet trolls and niggas tryna do me
650S, bitch, I feel like Lil Boosie
You want me, so do all your friends, is you stupid?
Stop complaining to me, I am not the one you love
Ain't comin' over late-night, don't want no shoulder rubs
In the trenches every night, bitch, I'm holdin' guns
Hold me down or could you slow me down?
I'm a dog 'cause you really know me now
I'm black and white, it's kinda gettin' holy now
Another reason I'ma have to slow it down
Snakes in the grass, you know I had to blow 'em down
We at the club, all my niggas down to slide
Look for the bright lights, I ain't really hard to find
We at the club, all my niggas down to slide
Look for the bright lights, I ain't really hard to find (The Ruler)

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't know if what we have is love but it's on my mind
We might slide on a nigga inside this club, girl, close your eyes
Fifteen brothers, no friends when I pull up for peace of mind
Lights come on, I'ma need you to come find me, don't be so shy

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
'Cause I know you want me, girl
'Cause I know you want me, girl
'Cause I know you want me, girl
'Cause I know you want me, want me girl
'Cause I know you want me
'Cause I know you want me, girl

[Verse 2: Drakeo the Ruler]
I know you want me, I know you love me
You can't control me, why you acting like the police?
Pussy ain't that good to keep me from my homies
We just cool bro, you gettin' too excited?
Ain’t seen your face when I was up on that indictment
Ain’t get a letter, I was strugglin' and fightin'
With these peoples, they was demons
Tried to put me in a cage, was sayin' "free me"
Now we on TV, drag racin' at 8-A
Rugrats in the car, we was babies
Ay baby, what's your name under these JPay's?
Got the audacity to talk to me, crazy, you buggin'

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't know if what we have is love but it's on my mind
We might slide on a nigga inside this club, girl, close your eyes
Fifteen brothers, no friends when I pull up for peace of mind
Lights come on, I'ma need you to come find me, don't be so shy

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
'Cause I know you want me, girl
'Cause I know you want me, girl
'Cause I know you want me, girl
'Cause I know you want me, want me girl
'Cause I know you want me
'Cause I know you want me, girl

DJ Paul
TWhy
Ayy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah, ayy
(Dopeman!)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ten of us, we movin' as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (Yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old
I promise I'm bridgin' the gap

[Chorus: Drake]
Woo! You know what I'm sayin'?
Woo! Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah!)

[Refrain: Drake]
Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These niggas around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Yo, get close enough to HOV, smell like a kilo still (Still)
First album 26, I ain't need no deal (Real)
Already a hood legend, I ain't need no Shyne (Woo!)
First Rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah
Stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments
Dope boys, Off-White, lookin' like soft white on 'em
Heh, you know what I'm sayin'?
We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
Live every word that I'm rappin'
Say I lost 90 bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe
Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been
I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like Young
I got your President tweetin', I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed X and let Zimmerman live, shhh, s-streets is done

[Chorus: Drake]
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah!)

[Refrain: Drake]
Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These niggas around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?




[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
'Cause mine's it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You work it off (work it off)
Baby I can give you extra credit (extra credit)
But there's something else
Girl, can I frisk you?
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
It's 'cause you're hidin' WMD's
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby, you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it mine?
Can I love you all my life?


[VERSE 1]
Man, you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
And love, I don't mind feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at

I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl

[BRIDGE]
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you

[VERSE 3]
You can call me professor
But baby you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
So you can work it off
Baby I can give you extra credit
But there's something else
Girl can I frisk you?
Search you body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
Its cause your hiding ?
And I'm going to sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me


[Hook]
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl

[BRIDGE]
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you

[OUTRO]
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it us?
Can I love you all of my life?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?


[Verse 2: Drake]
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?


[Outro: Dave]
Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ

[Verse 1: Drake]
Girl, I hate the fast talking, fast walking, fast fucking, fast loving oh
Wanna move slow
Got a little liquor in my system, always been friends underestimating how far that that shit go
Leave a little room for me
Leave a little room for your imagination
You should just take time with me
Nowadays there's time but not anticipation

[Pre-Hook: Drake + PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Oh oh oh
What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Nowadays you can't get enough of me
Loving me, loving me, loving me more
You loving me, love when you loving me
Oh yeah, yeah

[Pre-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me


[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Nowadays you can't get enought of me
Loving me, loving me, loving me more
You loving me, love when you loving me...
Oh yeah yeah



"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 1

[Verse 1: Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin]
You say it's simple, it's who you ought to be
Look in the mirror, you are not what you see
You say it's simple, but aren't your wings tired?
To tell the truth, why do you have to hide?

[Interlude: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
They telling me lies

[Bridge: Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin]
What's wrong with being someone else?
No shame, and living life their way, tell me lies

[Interlude: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
They like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
It's like

[Hook: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now

"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 2

[Verse: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
And now they like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
Cause the fabrication would help to settle that
And imagination would ease the pain
I came into this world as honest and pure
But can't guarantee to you that I'mma leave the same, so

[Hook: Drake as Jimmy Brooks, (Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin)]
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now, tell me lies

[Outro: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
I said, tell me lies


[Intro: Rich Homie Quan (Drake)]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah)
Rich Homie Quan
(Reps Up, OVO)
Rich Homie Quan
(You already...)
Baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill
I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit
And like you just got traded
Girl you don't know who you're playin' with
Aww yeah, aww yeah, my sound is what up right now
I've been down, but I'm up right now
Nigga been backstrokin' and breaststrokin'
Through that lane that you left open
Man I don't give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla


[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I don't know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue
I pictured the fate, is it true?
'Cause I tried to make this shit work
But it seems like you was in your feelings
You kept them hatin' bitches all in our business
But I just got one question, baby
Tell me why?

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Started from the bottom like Drake said
You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead
My squad'll  kick in your door where that safe at
No Atari, games girl I don't play that
If she broke I don’t acknowledge her, everything I say I follow up
What you talkin' 'bout? Ummmm, Polo shirt, my collar up
Drippin' on these hoes
Ain't by myself, it's a lot of us
Made a little money, still ain't got enough
And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up
Keep my eyes open, don't say nothin'
Motor geeked up like a razor
You don't know me, you must mistake me
For somebody else
But it's somethin' about you that I fell in love with
Your ex nigga, fuck him
I had to tell her that


[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I don't know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue
I pictured the fate, is it true?
'Cause I tried to make this shit work
But it seems like you was in your feelings
You kept them hatin' bitches all in our business
But I just got one question, baby
Tell me why?

[Outro: Rich Homie Quan]
Question, baby, tell me why
One question, baby, tell me why

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, live from the Waldorf in Berlin
Coming at you once again
With stories of truth and stories of sin
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, the ball is in your court
No defense, nobody's keeping score
No offense but I've played this before
Maybe you can and you just don't care anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Yeah
And I’m right back here when I said I wouldn't
You were never a good girl but you're a better woman now
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving, evolving
Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin, your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you, you deserve it
But you're too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious, I gotta ask how serious?
'Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like I'm not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy that's thrown at me
Been thinking 'bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley and Niks has Ezee
And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
E...


[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
We are not the same I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And they're about to call the wrong attention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined
And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I did it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill


[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Last year I did all the politicin'
This year I'm all focused on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixing
I'm talking about the ones from the beginning
Don't believe the rumours bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rocking camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killing
I'mma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin, everybody fucking
Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man it's been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill


[Verse 4: The Weeknd]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
It's only meant to fall in love
That shit is pointless

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill

[in progress...]


[Chorus]
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Yeah
Well, alright
Here I go

[Verse 1]
Uh, Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of "influential," I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, y-you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
That's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around


[Chorus]
Y-You could thank me now (Thank me now), go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now (You, you, you)

[Verse 2]
Uh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me, I'll miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at "Hello"
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it
I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position


[Chorus]
Y-you could thank me now (Thank me now), go 'head (Go 'head)
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said (What I said)
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
It's a- okay (Okay)

Before we do this I just wanna say thanks man. Thank you for the years you spent working with some of Toronto's true legends honing your craft. Thanks you for dropping everything to work with me after we met and realized we had something special. Thank you for pushing yourself despite the fact you should be resting to achieve an end goal that we are both obsessed with. Thank you for listening to me vent and talking me off ledges. Thank you for talking me out of sending every good song I make to someone else 😂. Thank you for reminding me that we set out to do something more than just have the biggest song in the club or the biggest song of the month. Thank you for building SOTA. Thank you for caring about the people in this city as much as I do. Thank you for a lifetime of hard work and surreal moments. This story would have gone a lot different without you. Thank you 40 (aka DB40 aka Cuarenta aka Bibber aka My brother). Text me when you are ready to start the next one 😂😂😂  @ovo40




[Verse 1]
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind

[Chorus]
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

[Refrain]
Rule number one to be a boss-ass bitch
Never let a clown honey try to play you
And if he play you, then rule number two
Is fuck his best friends and make 'em yes men
That's how you feel?
That's how you feel?

[Verse 2]
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and then you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try to get you off my mind

[Chorus]
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya




[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, woo

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind

[Chorus: Drake]
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj & (DJ Boof)]
Rule number one, to be a boss-ass bitch (Uh-huh)
Never let a clown nigga try to play you (Okay)
If he play you, then rule number two (Okay)
Is fuck his best friends and make 'em yes men (Okay)
And– (Wow, that's how you feel?)

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & (DJ Boof)]
What the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga?! Custom down?!
What the fuck, I ain't smokin' hot?! Bust me down?!
You the same clown nigga that was runnin' me down?!
Now you all up in my…'cause you wanna be down?! (Okay)
(Wow, that's how you feel?)


[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause


[Break]
You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me "Heartbreak Drake", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah


[Outro]
Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like
Man

Deoderant shoving deoderant up my ass now it smells good!
(outro)



I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
(Echo: I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready
(Echo: I'm ready, I'm ready)

Golden skies....Golden Streets... Golden Lives....
None of it compares to the look I see in her eyes....
Her Angel Wings Carried me from prior demise...
City of God who woulda thought I coulda made it riiight?
Just goes to show you love conquers all life's trials...
Loving the afterlife gotta say it's type wild...
MLK Malcolm Billie Holiday..
Left Eye Big L Pac and MJ
We all kicking it no time limits on our day
No stress we blessed we saw God's face........
This can be you if you not scared to make a way...

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
(Drake: I deserve it, I think it deserve it..Let it go)
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
(Drake: I can't take it)

Don't ever be afraid... to achieve the unthinkable...
You can do it..




We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
—Drake, Right Above It

Many years ago, I encountered a particularly tricky management situation. Two excellent organizations in the company, Customer Support and Sales Engineering, went to war with each other. The Sales Engineers escalated a series of blistering complaints arguing that the Customer Support team did not respond with urgency, refused to fix issues in the product, and generally inhibited sales and customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, the Customer Support group claimed that the sales engineers submitted bugs without qualification, did not listen to valid suggested fixes, and were alarmists who assigned every issue the top priority. Beyond the actual complaints, the teams genuinely did not like each other. To make matters worse, these groups had to work together constantly in order for the company to function. Both teams boasted superb personnel and outstanding managers, so there was nobody to fire or demote. I could not figure out what to do

During this time, I miraculously happened to watch the motion picture classic Freaky Friday starring the underrated Barbara Harris and the incomparable Jodie Foster—note: there is also a high quality remake starring Jamie Lee Curtis and the troubled, but talented Lindsey Lohan. In the film, mother and daughter grow completely frustrated with each other’s lack of understanding and wish that they could switch places and they do:

Through the course of the movie, by being inside each other’s bodies, both characters develop an excellent understanding of the challenges that the other faces. As a result, the two women become great friends when they switch back. After watching both the original and the remake, I knew that I had found the answer: I would employ a Freaky Friday management technique

The very next day I informed the head of Sales Engineering and the head of Customer Support that they would be switching jobs. I explained that, like Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris, they would keep their minds, but get new bodies. Permanently. Their initial reactions were not unlike the remake:

However, after just one week walking in the other’s moccasins, both executives quickly diagnosed the core issues causing the conflict. They then swiftly acted to implement a simple set of processes that cleared up the combat and got the teams working harmoniously. From that day to the day we sold the company, the sales engineering and support organizations worked better together than any other major groups in the company—all thanks to Freaky Friday, perhaps the most insightful management training film ever made


[Intro: Nickelus F]
Out tryna to get this paper

[Chorus: Nickelus F]
We in hoodies and timbs
Out on the grind
Rain or shine
Nickels and dimes
I'm out tryna to get his paper

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
I wake up, got money on mind
And I can't get off so I got to get on my grind
Got to get all my ducks in line
My bills in order crackers taking orders
For niggas in the race I got water
For niggas with hate I got llamas
Tissues for they mama
I'm flyer than Aladdin on a carpet
Saw A Whole New World when I made my profits
And my jasmine is a rapping
I do it the best, These niggas ain't smashing
Raw dog action
I impregenate the beat everytime I speak
A seed of my speech concives and MC! (Ho!)
Similar to me( yes),so we ain't' got to write just think
Keep it in the head like T
Spit listerine on the beat
Flossin' diamonds and me
Now peep the way I deliver on the beat
Is what you lack yeah that's why I'm so SWEET!
That's why yo chick want to pump me (right)
She want to be the chick from the other guy
Wanna be a lover I chuckle I laugh
As soon as you turn yo back I'm smashing
Hey I'm the other guy
Now you wanna rumble why
I mixed some limbs up make you a jambalaya
Wet you up
Roll you down the mountain and let your tumble drop
Throwback line for those who been listening (Uh!)
For all the new listeners that boy just filling
Niceklus is gifted nickename his Christmas
Make up a wishlish
Cop yall CD at this point I bet yall get it
At this point forget it..
I'm like a preganat woman I deliver
Now pop it push it!


[Chorus: Nickelus F]
We in hoodies and timbs
Out on the grind
Rain or shine
Nickels and dimes
I'm out tryna to get his paper

[Verse 2: Drake]
(I gotta spill on this)
That's why I roll up and tend to get high
Cause my arms won't extend to the sky
Peer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes
So I can only grab my pen and advise
Street legends and chicks seem to wonder
Exactly who I am
You know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup
It's Drake and Saint Nick
Take a whiff of this and faint quick
Off a sample of the flow patient
But I don't lie to rhymers
I strip walls and apply the primer
If there's a wall I'm gon' try to climb-aaa
Without a graded rope
Our navy seal Buddies yelling slurs at me
I'm always gon find another way to go
I'm minty fresh with the Green like I'm made a bathing scope
No bathing ape but I'm clean Like I'm made of soap
Begging for the fire
Buglars in hear we
We all good in the fam we like Meagan and limiya
I dress like Lou, I sell verses to label
And they give me the next joint
To sound less like you
That's something I had to say before
I'm real picky with real with lyrics
So don't use joints you probably would pay me for
I ain't' a heat busser
What up to Denik Rusha and Bei Major, Trey Songz, the street's Usher
Leak tracks and heat wax and he bust ya
And then sign ya
This is a reminder
This along the lines of Thrill is Gone still the song
I'mma mention Jay even though I feel it's wrong
We gave good ambition homegirl couldn't listen
Now she want the Snackpack back and her pudding's missin'
Bring the topic back
Please don't stop the track
Tropicana never got the hammer by my jock in-fact, I keep my money there
Mixtapes where I top em at
DJ Smallz.com you can shop at that
Speak of shopping I'm tryna get a label deal
Tryna live my dreams while awake, tryna make the fables real
No stealing cable trying to have my cable still
Better yet stolen, my grammar is golden
My grammer go harder than most rappers
There's a certain female rapper I will expose and
For once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing
No I didn't pen that Freestyle shit
I got a session with Digs so the beef I'm gone end that
Anybody else get the piece that I bend back
Let it marinate if you niggas dare to hate



[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Look, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement  just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."

[Outro: Birdman & Drake]
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, Big Tyme
"Sunshine," tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga – stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it




[Hook: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall

[Hook]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

[Hook]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Intro: Drake & Sampha]
It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 1: Drake, Drake & Sampha, Sampha]
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)


[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said "no strings attached" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Outro: Drake, Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?


[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: doorknob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi


[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Hook: Drake]
Every night it's all the same
Poppin' bottles for them bitches, gettin' faded
I'm happy you noticed
Houston numbers but sometimes﻿ I want a little conversation
I think it's time for somebody to notice
That this life is overrated cause I'm meant
For something realer than a good time getting faded
She just wanted someone to notice that her hair
Nails did and for somebody to notice that she bad

[Verse 1: Celeb Forever]
I haven't seen you in forever its been ages
You ain't aged a bit
Still the same woman you was back in 06' damn swag
Still so cold, we so throwed, how you been?
I've been fine, how's your son? He two years old
Damn I feel old
I'm rockin' this gold she rockin' that white rollie
This bitch so tight Only here for the night
Where you been all my life? I need you to show me
She with golds and poppin' this ice
Damn well I'm a goldie wait They gon' hate
That's how it go that's how you know you killin' em'
And fuck these hoes, I say baby ooh, look at'chu
Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, get em boo
Louie V, Cool with me, girl do you
It's just me and Sean McGee up in Loumans
Going crazy buying bottles like new parents, cool
One, two, three and to the four, girl I want you
To break these bitches off
Break em' off with ya hot ass, girl that's Dragon Tales
You got it go ahead brag it girl you bad
And where them bitches, over there swear they wack as hell

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Celeb Forever]
Stunnin' on these boys, seem like me ain't got no choice
See your bitch I bet she rolls When I pull up in that Royce
Did a show last night at (?) and I just got back my voice
And that's good cause she swear that's what use to make her pussy moist
Well her body It's to crowded V.I.P. look like the floor
And we just ran out of bottles, could ya'll please bring us some more?
You know ballers bring the models so theres bitches thank the lord
Put that on my mama, you the hottest bitch in it for sure
Ooh we've done that, we've done that, that shit feel all the same
Sick of waking up with women that I do not know they name
And she sick of being forgotten after it come out as Kate
So that's why I went I got her when I saw her body stay
Be like one, two, three and to the four, girl I want you
To break these bitches off
Break em' off with ya beautiful self
Babe you look perfect, I don't see nothin' you can do that with help
So don't you worry
You bad

[Hook]

[Bridge x2: Drake]
And for somebody to notice
And for somebody to notice
And for somebody to notice
That she bad, bad

[Outro: Drake]
Poppin' bottles for them bitches, gettin' faded
Im happy you noticed
Houston numbers but sometimes﻿ I want a little conversation

I'mma kill the game, I'm the Young Money white knight
Yeah, plus I'm lookin for the right type
Cautious of a flood so I always lay the right pipe
Wes put me on the marquee flight life
Plus I go hard for the woman that I might wife
I put the ring on her index finger
So if you wanna keep ya girl please don't bring her
I bet I'm the type of guy that she got a thing for
And you would block me, but this ain't Jenga
Yeah, and she's someone I would work with
That's what I can tell from what she's showin' on the surface

[Produced By Rich Kidd]

[Verse 1]
Shake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough cloud for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, "Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?"
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways
Cause I need drug money Who got drug money?
I am talkin "white Phantom sittin' on dub" money
I am talkin "cold champagne at the club" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb? (dumb)
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
And spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum
I fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from


[Interlude]
Oh! Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity
To formally welcome you to this extravaganza
That I call Comeback Season
Hope you enjoy your stay
Drinks are on me, by the way, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise


[Outro]
Shout out to 40-40
Yeah my right hand!



[Intro]
Yeah
Look
I never been the type to take love
And never ever will I fake love
But maybe we can make love, yeah
I kinda like those things you do
You know I still got that thing for you
And maybe I can teach you a thing or two, yeah
And maybe we can touch a cloud
We might not make our parents prou
But, fuck it
Cause I be on some cool shit
But I ain't tryna prove shit
If you ain't tryna be down
Then we can just be cool, shit
Forreal though, like
We should leave it to the birds to hide
We might not make it to the other side
But tell me is you down to ride?
Cause they'll miss us, before we miss them
And they'll diss us, no matter what we give them
So like, fuck it
You down?
Or nah?
This is the quest

You are now on cloud number nine

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I sit and wonder if it is what you say
You see, I know I got you feeling some kinda way
I'm trying to feel at home at that place that you stay
Or we can get it poppin' in some shit far away
I still feel like I'm on a quest for you
Getting dressed feeling like I'm getting dressed for you Opinionated but you make me digress for you
And I know you gotta do what's best for you
So I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
On cloud nine
Up past my bedtime
No rest at the kingdom
I'm up in my zone but I'm not alone
All that I can think of is
We should get higher
We can get higher

[Chorus]
Let's start rollin' up on this and let's get higher
Let's get higher
Let's get higher
Let's get higher (x2)

I just wanna say I'm yours, I'm yours
I just wanna say I'm yours, I'm yours
I know you think I'm playing
But I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours, I'm yours
I just wanna say I'm yours, I'm yours
I know you think I'm playing
But I'm yours, I'm yours

[Verse 2]
You see, I think it's dope that
We got two different minds
We got two different paths
And we on two different grinds
We got two different style
And stand on two different ceilings
But damn, some kinda way
We got identical feelings, it's like
I been through hell to get right where I am, and
You been through hell to get right where you are
I think it's meant to be that we're right where we are
So if you ever wander just don't wander too far
I'm still

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
But you wasn't really real
You ain't even really fuck with me
All this time passed and the shit still fucks with me
Got me thinking if the shit is what it's suppose to be
You said it was good but the shit just sucked to me
And you was just bad luck to me
Could have been the one
But you was just bad luck to me

[Verse 3]
Ayo
I'm the guy that's always tryna get high
And sometimes
I like to leave and be at one with the sky
And that's when
I get to thinking, damn another lonely night
Seem like love not for me
So I'm just loving my mic
I been through hell and back
Tryna fill this hole in my heart
And it fails, it just fails
And I'm just back at the start
My sanity then departs
And revenge is what I'm craving
Bodies dropping, steady plotting
Thinking 'bout assassination
As my guard gets stronger
Hit-list gets longer
Am I forever alone?
This the shit that I ponder
Are you out there in the world
Or did you already leave it?
If this is what love is
Then shit I don't really need it
So it's just back to the mic
And it's just back to the grind
No more opening up
No more wasting my time

[Outro]
Ima, ima be up here on a cloud
'Til I think it's time to re-up on the loud
Midnight on Cloud Nine




[Verse 1: Drake]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

[Chorus: Drake]
But I gotta say, "Oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?"
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must of done this before, this can't be your first time
We must of been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You must of done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 2: Drake]
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too
We're perfect for each other

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

[Chorus: Drake]
But I gotta say, "Oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?"
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must of done this before, this can't be your first time
We must of been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You must of done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
I don't wanna be in the blind but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it
If I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first but it's better than your last; Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
You must of done this before, this can't be your first time
We must of been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You must of done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship, all of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote on quote, "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
'Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them, "That ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
"Someone Like You," more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies




[Intro]
Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I-I- I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go

[Verse 1]
Should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!"
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"

[Verse 2]
Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit "redial", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"

[Verse 3]
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over


[Intro: Drake]
I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me man
I hate that shit
It’ll be a long time before y'all feel me, if ever
For real

[Verse 1: Drake]
You won’t feel me 'till everybody
Say they love you, but it’s not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass keep getting thicker than a plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It’s feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, nigga


[Hook: The Weeknd]
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride

[Verse 2: Drake]
You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga


[Hook: The Weeknd]
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride

[Verse 3: Drake]
I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I’m driving right up to it now
Make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping M’s and sipping dirty jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I’m bout to fuck and I’m just praying that it feels good
I really don’t know much but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my nigga don’t believe it
I mean, sure, there’s some bills and taxes I’m still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches
Still scorching as if I didn’t notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
I’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldn’t fuck with my freshman floater (flow ta)
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it
My juniors and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga


[Hook: The Weeknd]
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride

Even say the same thing twice
Sometimes sometimes
...so

How you feel about
Knowing that i can't keep it to myself
I don't want you anybody else
I don't wanna keep it to myself
People : I don't like people
I don't deserve them

[Verse IV]
To my city
I get it i get it
Id never be hot there and thats why
Im not there i know i admit it

And nine out of ten times i
Wouldn't have doubted my self for a minute
But i swear it's taking so long that uh
Even my name reminiscing
It's one time

This cutting into my fun time
This ain't no game cuz i run time
It don't stop for a minute
Son i'm
Done wait

Lastly - God changed my life very fastly
Wanna shoot me down - that's yo ass b
Wanna go to heaven
Then you gotta let him be great


[Round 1: The Saurus]
Before they announced my name you had the whole crowd seated
And Rich ain't show up so now you get that show out treatment
Your opponent couldn't cross the border: ain't that sweet?
So now them URL bars you got is aimed at me?
I hopped a flight last-minute soon as they paid that fee
I boarded (aborted) but it was Pro choice to take Plan B
Man it sucks that battle didn't work out, cause shit is gettin' worse now
You 'bout to feel that same fire that brought the Hindenberg down
You ain't battlin' Rich Dolarz no more, but after I spit this first round
I bet $100,000 you gon' wish you were now
Ninja focus, you get checked with something extra like a Christmas bonus
I don't pick opponents, I hunt and kill them in the moment
Took this shit on 20 minutes notice
I've been the coldest, if I hit him, Pro gets stapled down the middle like a centerfold is
When in Rome, you gettin' thrown in the arena
Lookin' like a Mexican Ice-T, Corona and Tequila
Peep the gold gloves: Midas Touch
E.T., light him up
Get beat by an iron club like the Ryder Cup
I tried to warn him, you're no match for me, Pro
It's no accident
I'll run you over on both fields on some Bo Jackson shit!
Don't ask for this
I'm not someone to throw hands against
Tryin' to play hero will only get Pro tagged in this (protagonist)
Closed-casket bitch, you know I'm brick-solid
How'd you go from Rich Dolarz to the ghost of Chris Wallace?
I'm nice!


[Round 1: J-Pro]
So this is the replacement for Rich Dolarz?
A quick combo will open you up like a gym locker
I'll beat you til my hands more bloody than Stigmata
Til a bone is poppin' out of your nose like a witchdoctor
You got more holes in your face than a hockey mask
If looks like you and Freddy Kruger had a boxing match
I'm glad you replaced Rich, I'd have dropped his ass
And tossed Dolarz around this stage like it's pocket cash
I'm the core revolutionary that ran through 'em
A brown beret in the driver's seat lampooning
A Black Panther in the shotgun; Cam Newton
Clap through him, Rasputin
Y'all saw what I did to Bulletz, I turned this bitch to a mass shootin'
Now I'm back, I get love from these Toronto fans
I know you like to gamble Pete but this is not yo' hand
Check the name on the venue, I go HAM
I got the Queen Elizabeth goin' crazy, I'm the Macho Man
Ooooh yeaaaah! Son I'm a Savage
How y'all replace him for Rich? Money is average
You're an average Joe
You battled Illmac' and tried to leave your man exposed
But he killed you, we saw the box on stage like a magic show
Then Deadman put you in a casket closed
You always been a shaky-ass performer: Amber Rose
Your fat jiggles when you rap in each direction
Walkin' around in real life lookin' like you're in three dimensions
Mexican's roll deep, you better seek protection
My cartel (car tell) in the streets like I need directions
Where's your career headed, Pete? It's been six years since your best battle
You're barely enhancin'
You're still tryin' to top yourself: Marilyn Manson
You were the man in the freestyle era, you were livin' the dream
But battle rap changed and you don't fit in the scene
You ain't Lebron James, this is your king?
You more like Malone, Stockton, you'll never win in the ring
Mr. Two Time Everything, the old champ's back
Now excuse him while he gives himself a Pat on the back
Charron's tramp stamp
It took a while to react, they still don't get it
How'd you birth a thousand battlers and still look pregnant?


[Round 2: The Saurus]
Yo, that one bar you said about Mexican's was subpar
Cause yeah, y'all do roll deep, but all of you are in one car
This was supposed to be your big moment homie, breathe it in a bit
Cause now they got you battlin' me, reconsider it
I got it sewn, no need to stick a needle into it
How fitting, Randy Savage in a ring at Queen Elizabeth
Most people need two months for this shit, give me a week
I'll waste the first six days writin' my victory speech
Your chicky? She been itchin' to get this mystery meat
So I passed that piece (peace) pipe like an Indian chief
You bringin' me beef? Fuck it, it's smack down time
Rooftop, when I say "jump" don't ask, "How high?"
You said you'd body Blackout 5, you flat out lied
Cause I'm the winner (winter) so cold you think you('d) back outside
This sounds fine, who else could do this on one day's prep?
Show interest, then it's settled like an unpaid debt
I'm headline worthy you ain't made a front page yet
So is me replacing Rich Dolarz an upgrade? YES!
I just ain't stressed about this little goof
I'm still the truth, you little fuckin' pygmy, you
Look up at me when I'm killin' you!
If he loses, no matter where he go he get laughed at
And if he wins? Fuck it, Rey Mysterio gets his mask back

[Round 2: J-Pro]
Yo, you revolutionized battle rap? Pete miss me
Your only revolution was goin' through 180 to 360
Yo Peter Morris, when did you eat The Saurus?
He's enormous, how do your feet support this? You're a freakin' walrus
Back stabbin' your best friend was your peak performance
You battled Illmac' that was '09, must be a slow grind
Cause it's 2015 and you been wack....this whole time
I mean look at Dumbfoundead, Dizaster, even Soul Khan
Then look at Pete doin' Soul Khan's slogan just tryin' to hold on...hold on...hold on!
You still tryin' to hold to battle rap bro....oh my God
Peter Morris is in my face I can't believe this


{chokes and then freestyles}
Fuck it, we gon' get through the rest of the round
Just tryin' to show y'all how we freestyle we gettin' this now
It was Blackout 5, let me blackout live
You said you're so fuckin' cold I'd be back outside
It doesn't really matter, I freestyle best on the market
You're wearin' that fuckin' sweater so we can tell who the mark is
Cousin, bust it, ooooh come on!

You're still tryin' to hold on to battle rap? You should reexamine your life
You're fuckin' with a Pro this ain't amateur night
Tell your dogs I kill cats when I handle the mic
I came to put an end to Peter (PETA) with these animal rights
And I hope you came to punch back
Cause Arsonal said he'd smack your daughter with his nut rag and you just stood there like, "Ho ho ho. Man I love that."
Don't react while I'm killin' you, even through a choke, I don't want that
You're the most embarrassing thing in battle rap since Chris Unbias's mustache
Get out of them Facebook groups, where you diss the fans
You talk more shit to Stans than Vince McMahon
Yeah I overuse similes, I tip my hand
I drop more likes than Hitman Holla's Instagram
Fake follwers
But I don't need a brother to hold me up, ampin' the crowd
I don't got a gun so big I gotta drag it around
I got 30 pages of rhymes to make you crash through the crowds
And have the whole crowd lookin' like Christian 818 durin' Canibus' rounds
Dude I got through a choke it's awfully goofy
I'm who you C.O.D. it's my Call Of Duty
Be honest pussy, I'll rock your kufi
You've been put in the air by more battlers than Bonnie's booty
Everybody on this card beat him
You lost to 100 Bulletz bro?
[Thesaurus] No
[J-Pro] Yes you did. You lost to him in the UK
[T] I didn't
[J] Fuckin' liar
[T] Indecisive
[J] Bullshit
[T] He spit Pokemon bars

[J-Pro]
Last year I caught a body for sure
I gave him punch after punch; Gotti and Ward
I had him makin' excuses, soon as he walked through the door
Bulletz was hangin' onto his chest like a Somalian war
You lose a lot, I maneuver plots
I'll kill you with the cool side of the pillow, word to Stuart Scott
You were hot, in the WRC's but your future flopped
You get more ass every year that's a booty shot

[Round 3: The Saurus]
First off I can freestyle way better than you dawg
Off top, Sports Center; one shot: BOOYAH!
And now I'm 'bout to dead it son
You got 30 pages of rhymes up in this motherfucker? Thank God you finally remembered one
Yeah you heard it son, it ain't until this verse is done
Where the fuck y'all think lil' Charron learned it from?
They say a good defense is the best offense
I'd say you were best off tossin' the towel at the press conference
Next topic: when you stretch bars I get nausious
Left cross, you bring out the worst in me like sweat lodges
So just stop it, off top yo this scene's not scripted
Ironic, I hit J and he got lifted
Two pumps and ain't a pair of Reebok's with it
Watch Pete coach Pro, no Seahawk's tickets
Now this shit? Homie this shit, it's backhanded time
Fuck what Pro has in store I can't stand the line
Fuck what J has in store yo I can't stand the line
(that would've been way better if I would've said that)
Now you gettin' flattened by me I guess it's over buddy
I'm 'bout to...break your fuckin' face and now you owe me money
That was from the last event, I'ma come up and snap your neck
This is me, the fuckin' main speaker here, catchin' wreck
Now if I passed away tomorrow...I think the whole world-it would probably shut the world down
Wait, but if J-Pro died tomorrow they'd be like, "Fuck. Who's gonna work the door now?"
Time

FUCK!

[Round 3: J-Pro]
Yo man it's alright, we both did it
[Thesaurus] I did it because of you. You inspired me
[J-Pro] We're in this together dude
[Thesaurus] We are. It was a team effort
[J-Pro] Yo! Back to being a dickhead
[Thesaurus] True. True

[J-Pro]
I heard Uno boned your ex, banged her for weeks
Did her worse than Mystique then shovel danced in your sheets
Then I heard you guys ran train, I guess Peter is right
You two time everything, even your wife
I'm so deadly, two can' same result; Coke/Pepsi
You get ex'ed out and stay thirsty; Dos Equis
I saw you get killed by Dan, don't test me
You let that man go nuts in your face; Loe Pesci
You traveled all that flight distance and I'm glad you made it
Cause as soon as they turn that FilmOn we seen that Rich bitch fuckin' up more battles than Alki David
You seen that footage; Lush wrestling Alki
Ran up on him, then grabbed his neck in the lobby
This would've been similar to that, I'd be catchin' a body
Cause that Rich fool be chokin' in the ring more than Ted Diabiase
Yeah I brought bars about wrestlin' moves
You're the fuckin' man for tryin' to step in his shoes
But now I gotta leave you dead, you'll be left in a tomb
Jimmy Fallon Show, leave him next to The Roots
Kick him a couple times, like, "Yeah that's a real body"
I don't feel this pussy; Charron when he drills Tarsi
I know your real hobbies, playing online poker and beer pong with Bill Cosby
First punch, put him in a daze, that's Rico
Second punch, put him back in a daze (days); that's Skee-Lo
Third punch, death ridin' beside him, that's evil
Fourth punch, they'll be ridin' (writin) together Mac Lethal
That BOLA shit, right?
He hit me like, "Pro it's last minute are we riding together?"
I was like, "From the airport?" He was like, "Nah, literally writing together?"
Fuck that I'm applying the pressure
This is Pete's peril, a last second call got you picked off; Pete Carrel
He's like, "Yo when you see Hawks (Seahawks)" you blaze nada
How did y'all expect a gambling addict to save Dolarz?
I know you're in Las Vegas, playin' your little cards
And late night The Saurus goes to underage titty bars

[Thesaurus] Do those exist in Vegas?

[J-Pro]
He's like, "Do those exist? Man that isn't real
But then he turns into Loaded Lux when he gets caught, "I just had to get the feel"
I'm just freestylin'
You should be on Loaded Lux level, I mean The Saurus old
He was battlin' since cave painting in Morse code
You can tell a The Saurus fan from they wardrobe
Cause only computer geeks think Saurus cold (source code)
He's like, "Scribble Jam! Scribble Jam! We freestyled it was raw it's impossible!"
That was just off beat dick jokes and more pre-meds than a volunteer hospital

(Saukrates intro)
They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all

[Verse 1: Drake]
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy
Now I'm out in A-Town
They tellin' me Trey sound
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purposeless game
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on

[Drake & Saukrates: Hook]
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all


[Verse 2: Saukrates]
Yeah
Let me show you how to blast up
Now tell me who is a masta
A mind never wasted
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up
See where we from, the 50's are bloody
And the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown, they love me
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of
My lapel, is custom made
You off the rack shit
I'm off the chain, come on
The dogs are loose
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With 40 and Mac Dre
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk
Drake'll give you the deal
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill
Keep on, keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh)

[Hook]


[Verse 3: Drake]
Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda
Ol' time killin'
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin'
And now the girls like
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin'
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin'
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And  now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold
And keep on, on, on, on, on

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do

[Hook]
These days

[Verse 2]
I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think
About how I have failed
To change all of my ways

[Hook]
These days

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another
These days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs

[Hook]
These days

[Verse 4]
I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming
These days
These days
I sit inside a chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars
These days
These days


Intro:
I wouldn't be me if I didn't get a little nasty
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na hey
They say all I talk about is sex

Verse (Trey Songz):
How 'bout we just pull over and do it where we at
How 'bout you just lift that skirt up, ooh we can be bad
That place that ain't been touched, I'm feelin on it
All that juicy fruit, keep spillin' on it
Girl, giddyup, get it up take me on a ride to extacy
You don't wanna pump pump then take a nap
You just wanna pump pump, bring it right back
Watch me (Watch me), Im'a heat it up beat it up

Hook:
Know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon feel something unusual


Verse (Trey Songz):
I want to do the freaky things you never do
What if we did it while your friends was in the room
Is that too much for ya?
Don't you feel bad, let them see your sexy ass
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they ain't got to know (no)
Watch me heat it up beat it up
Hey, do you hear me girl
Woah watch me heat it up beat it up

Hook:

Bridge:
Restaurants (check), Cinemas (check)
On the hood (check) of the car
Counter top (check), Balcony (check)
In the jet (check), On the beach (leggo)

Rap (Drake):
This that other shit, You know your asked for it
I might just send you some money to get your passport
So you can come to my city, I'll take you all over
And hit you on the balcony just don't fall over
Send me your picture baby you know I'll never leak it
I know you got something recent for someone decent
Why you laughin' out loud, I'm serious
Bring your girl if she's a little bi-curious
Please, please no story tellin' to others
I promise you gon' love it
I would never let you down
Feel like I might have perfected all the things that you expected
You gon know it when you bring your ass around


Hook:

Outro:
Do it all different ways or different places
Look at the many love faces your makin'
But can you take it

Yall thought I was nasty last time...Leggo



[Verse 1]
I’m performing tonight you know that shit gone be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact
My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trendsetting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
I’m it I’m it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish I'ma wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, Balmain blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

[Verse 2]
Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It’s about time that you made it
I was bumping your songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can’t sign nothing 'til my lawyer get the facts and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it’s not about who you know
It’s just how you balance it
It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
It's how you start actin' when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

[Verse 3]
Uhh, ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in your starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A lot of people sayin' fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Ts
And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band don’t you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us

[Bridge]
And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Sher
I’ll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel, I hope heaven’s prepared for whenever you there

[Verse 4]
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through your stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motherfucking Mario
Yeah and Polo isn’t at my session
Mr.Anticipation keeping everybody guessing like

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah




Intro:

So C-Lee.....So C-Lee


[VERSE 1]

[C-Leezy]

You got my nerves gone
When you swerve off, turn your phone off

Pull your apllication for business
Mrs. cuz  you married
To me it mean that maybe you gone love em till the day he
Slip up get caught cheatin
Then I'll b there for the time being
Baby girl we jus human beings
Make mistakes we dont mean to make
Out of all the things that ive ever seen
You seem to me like a piece a cake
Do my thing and then maybe skate
If the pussy good then I'll prolly stay
If the pussy good then I could eat for days
If your attitude at a latitude where I dont need no parachute
Then turn over let me handle you
Tip me, gratitude
Kiss me, red lipstick
So they know who I'm tached too
So I know its real  get a tattoo
Then that dude, and that dude gone recognize that I had you
This roller coaster move faster

Stalking me and my tags with some old chicks that I smashed
Insecure bout yah ass
Insecure bout your class
She need to be self secure with a confidence that dont ask

Aterol, hash
Alcohol, extacy, and two lines threw my cash
Friends callin me cabs

[VERSE 2]

[Drake]

Woah, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man if pole dancing's an art you know how many fuckin’ artists I know
Got some new bills in the mail
Got some big favours I owe
Got some good things ahead of me
When these bad bitches let go
Well, girl let's go
Walk your broken heart through that door
Sit yo sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs jus’ ain't you (be you)
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown
It been going down it ain't new
That’s that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But its all good, don’t stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
You don’t really like attention, I don’t know if she gon manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place
Shit I did all of that on my own
Oh yea...


[Intro: The Weeknd]
Ooh ahh
Ooh ahh, ahh
Ohh yeah, yeah
Ooh ahh, ahh

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Why you rushing me, baby? It's only us, alone
I don't want to die tonight, baby, so, let me sip this slow
I'll give you what you called for, just let me get in my zone
I'll be making love to her through you
So, let me keep my eyes closed

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
And I won't see a damn thing, I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right, oh-ooh
I won't see a damn thing, I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right, oh-ooh, yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'ma touch you right (Ooh, yeah, just let me sip this slow)
I'ma touch you right (Let me get inside my zone)
I'ma touch you right, (Oh, yeah, just let me)
Ohh ahh, ahh
Ooh yeah


[Verse 2: Drake]
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art
You know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail
Got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me
When these bad bitches let go, well, girl, let's go
Walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth, I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you
Be you (Be you), yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown
It being going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention
I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place
Shit, I did all of that on my own, aw yeah


[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'ma touch you right, ohh yeah
(Just let me sip this slow)
Ooh, I'ma touch you right
(Let me get inside my zone)
Ooh, I'ma touch you right
(Just let me)
Ohh ahh, ahh
Ooh yeah

I'ma touch you right, ooh baby
(Just let me sip this slow)
No, I'ma touch you right, baby, ooh
(Let me get inside my zone)
Ooh-hoo, I'ma touch you right, ooh yeah

Ohh ahh, ahh

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]

A beauty so divine [?]
Let niggas waste your time that couldn't afford it
And even though I fucked you, i still want you (still want you)
Every selfie take so perfect aren't you
Hold on baby I can't even stunt though
Hold on baby I can't get enough no
Open up your doors you lead the way for me

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]

Hold on wait a minute I ent ever sipping

[Chorus]

Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know

Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Got class, got ass, body like a bottle shape, she don't fuck with any niggas many, niggas by the way


[Verse 1: Drake]
I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
These days

[Verse 2: Babeo Baggins]
I stopped my rambling
Never been once a gambler, my town
But for you, for you, for you, just once
It might be fine these days
These days

[Verse 3: Drake]
I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think about how I have failed to change all of my ways, ohh
These days

[Verse 4: Both]
Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs
These days


[Verse 5: Babeo Baggins & Drake]
I've had lovers
I've had lovers, one after another
But this time, me, myself and I are just fine
These days
These days

[Verse 6: Drake]
I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming these days
These days
I sit inside a chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars these days
These days



[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
9th Wonder
Don't judge me, man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El 'bout to prove 'em wrong, though

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 1: Drake]
They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart, girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart, girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'ma take this hat off, and I'ma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
'Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 2: Phonte]
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping 'bout trapping you's a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, 'cause I ain't dumb, shit, I'm well-read like sunburn
And after me, you'll never leave no stone unturned

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Yeah, they say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying, so they coming off paper-thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down
To see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle
To get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play
But your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now, I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback, that's written all over your face
No, El will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me




This kid is so bad, this kid is so bad, this kid is so bad, cause he's mad, ay
This Kid thinks he so cool, and he looks like a bunny, this kid is a meme boy and he lives under a rock
This kid is so bad, this kid is so bad, this kid is so bad, cause he's mad, ay
This Kid thinks he so cool, and he looks like a bunny, this kid is a meme boy and he lives under a rock

This kid is so bad, this kid is so bad, this kid is so bad, cause he's mad, ay
This Kid thinks he so cool, and he looks like a bunny, this kid is a meme boy and he lives under a rock

This kid is so bad, this kid is so bad, this kid is so bad, cause he's mad, ay

[Hook: Voyce]
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy Omar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Alisha lately
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh

[Hook: Voyce]
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

[Verse 2: Drake]
Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces, circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like MacGyver, cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple of years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh

[Hook: Voyce]
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

[Verse 3: Drake]
Check
And nowadays, some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it, see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing, ger reputation's in jeopardy
Cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

[Hook: Voyce]
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone




She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes (You know we had to go shopping one more time right, I think we forgot something haha)

Cause the queen supposed to get what she desire what she wants
If my lady likes to eat, then I'm a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this cream, she the fire to my blunt
You can try it if you want but it's gon cost you
Bags with the G's, jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do
That nigga ain't ya nigga unless he endorse you
They say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'

Everytime we leave the manager say, "come again"
Honestly shes probably old enough to be my momma's friend
She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again
If the card declined you need to check that shit and run again
They don't give you limits when you keep that money coming in
Yeah, just fold some paper round the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband until she found out he cheats
Then she filed for divorce and watched that bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
He son that's 26 but he just went to away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's a baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaazy
And I be spending all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in 86
Yeah, she say that she lucky that she his

Shorty so nice, I don't mean polite
When I say nice, I mean looking right
And you can't put a price on something looking right
If they ask how much, tell em what it's looking like
Everything I buy fly, it's like I'm booking flights
If I want it I'm a get it, that should not be tooken light
And it's on everything I got a crazy lady
So money ain't a thing, Jay-z, JD
Like Jay-Z lady, it's Beyonceing
Supporting your woman goes beyond paying
Watching me ball is like LeBron playing
I'm in the Louie shoes you might see Kanye in
They say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine

[Verse 1:]
Girl you’re so kind, I think you’re the best
You’re an angel not a devil when you’re in that blue dress
With the girls I find they always seem to fail my tests
Or rather I fail her tests cause I can’t do long-term like the rest
I’m a player I confess, it barely takes two secs
To get her to leave her ex within three hours we're near sex
With my hands I caress, her chest, her soft nice flesh
But at my age I can’t rest, only tension is a stress
Pretty girl in your bedroom, chilling out with no makeup on
That’s when you're the prettiest, girl please don’t take that wrong
But you will only trip if I went and brought R-Patz along
Kristen Stewart was holy fit, then those photos got snapped upon
I know I preyed upon those older girls, those out of this world
Now I’m going back down to Earth, fuck all the shit that’s stirred
I’m truly a find, I’m your fantasy in disguise
They say love is blind, girl you’d better close your eyes

[Hook: Drake]
Call me crazy shit at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right


[Verse 2:]
Last Valentine’s Day I met a girl named Renee
We were in love by May, then she found out about April
So she chose to March, damn another broken heart
Don’t blame her, she can’t take a part, it’s my fault I say
Girl now you know all of my past relationships okay
Don’t act with me, you left that old cast on the ship today
Let’s take a holiday, to Las Vegas or LA
Or somewhere just to sit and watch boats by the bay
When you’re young your looks are such a blessing
But a curse, because a boy can’t look at you for five seconds
You’ll just feel insecure, I’m so sure
But that fear can be cured, cause girl I’m the cure
That's my lure, the man who don't do killing
Except lyrically, but personally is just into romantic feelings
Baby tell me your inner thoughts and your deepest emotions
The next thing you see is an ecstasy explosion

[Hook: Drake]
Call me crazy shit at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right



[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Still with the dawgs that I grew beside
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
I'm outside in an AMG, yeah
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me

[Verse 1]
I just caught a shawty off a finsta
Just threw on a hoodie, it's a Crenshaw
Way that I been livin' unconventional
I'm just tryna make it to the end, ya know
Certain things just started gettin' tenser
Think we need to have us an adventure
I could be your man but maybe down the road
Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome
Rather see my heart turn crystal
I can't even front like I don't miss ya
Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own
Soon as I free up, I'm 'bout to pop up on your phone like

[Chorus]
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Heart's still on javelin, baby
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
I was pullin' off 'fore they knew me
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me
When it was you and me
I felt like I love you too much to change you
You believe in angles more than angels
Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you
Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you
Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you
Wish it stayed the same for you, sorry
I'm sorry

[Outro]
And-and-and-and—
I'm outside in a—
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm— (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—)
I'm outside in a—
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm— (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—)
I'm outside in a—
And-and-and-and I'm outside in a—
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm— (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—)
I'm outside in a—
Woi-oi, woi-oi-woi-oi-woi-oi-woi-oi-woi-oi




Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Drake & Future]
[...]
-girl, you know me
Still with the dawgs that I grew beside
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by (Yeah)
I'm outside in an AMG (Oh)
Right outside-


And I roll up looking harder than a....bitch!
Damn a nigga never switch
You should get your cherry bust
Before you fuck around with this!
I buy some Rolexes and pass 'em out as gifts
And when they tell me that's too much
I'm like "No, fuck it, I insist!"
And then we light it up and reminisce
About the things that we would fix
How the fuck we got this rich?
This is just some inspiration
For young niggas on they shit!
This for my young niggas on they shit for real
This also for the hood stars that I created
Whose booking rate went up right after we dated
Girl you made it for real
Hosting parties with athletes or another rapper
Then they trying to fuck you after
Remember when you was my....bitch!?
My special friend with benefits
You remember how you got here?
Hope to God you ain't forget
But the look you're giving me tells me you did
Empty stares across the club
Like y'all don't recognize the kid
But damn, you know what it is
Cameras flashing over here, I know that's something
That you miss, yeah
It been bad, and it gets good
Drizzy Drake and the nigga Tim Westwood



[Verse 1]
Wild things you're doing at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doing it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as the real thing

[Chorus]
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

[Post-Chorus]
What are you doing lately?
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
You know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You know
That's not the way to get over me

[Verse 2]
I can't recover from all this conversation
You called me weak and you testing my manhood as we yell at each other
You wanted me to go and put my hands on you just to show you I love you
Just know I can jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you said, despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You acting out, you know you love to see a young nigga suffer

[Bridge]
You, you, you know, know, know
That's not the way to get over me
That's not the way to get over

[Refrain]
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
You know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You know
That's not the way to get over me




[Intro: Future]
Fuckin' cockroaches
Muthafuckin' Freebandz
Want me to be the bad guy?
Wanna fuckin' play?
Ya know?
Come on!
It's the Cartel, nigga!

[Chorus: Future]
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ends
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take 'em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

[Verse 1: Future]
I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east, where niggas split your cantaloupe
You tell me where you wanna meet, I'm comin' with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud, I'm laced up to the fuckin' fo'
A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, droppin' all cash (Woah)
Gutter to the death of me, I'm stickin' to the recipe
Plugged in with Colombians, I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word, fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused

[Chorus: Future]
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana (Who you)

[Verse 2: Drake]
On the hood you see the Stallion, passenger a stallion
Niggas gettin' nervous, I'm passin' out the Valium
I suggest you pop it, but please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin' up in 400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes'll see me, be like that's how you feelin'?
Used to stay up at The Twelve, now you're worth like 12 million
Boy, you did it, boy, you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fuckin' women that knew Biggie, so it really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO, and Freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I'm Tony in my city, huh

[Chorus: Future]
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

[Verse 3: Future]
Another shot of Quelo, she'll be comin' back to pesos
When you're plugged in with Pedro, it's hard for hoes to let go
See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga, I'll split your tato
Ain't nothin' about me ordinary, I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss, it's gon' take an army
The world is mine, nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin' with me, you'll move to Alaska by the mornin'
You want me to be the bad guy? Okay, it's on then
Champagne spillin', crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin', she say I ain't playin' fair
I'm about to cop a tiger, and put it in the car seat
Freebandz a company, so, nigga, it don't matter, ayy


[Intro: Drake]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted

You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 3: Drake]
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix (Six)
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I


[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted

You take my love for granted

[Pre-Chorus: Conor Maynard & Sarah Close]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another player on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you could have it

[Chorus: Conor Maynard & Sarah Close]
You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
Oooh, you

Tell the UK tings that I soon forward
I might go Visions with Skeppy
I might touch road, do section
I might just, I might just
Buy [?] since Richview
Dreamin' of the places I can get to
Drizzle, all the mandem miss you
Man like that need a visa to get you, baow
But, girl, listen
I wanna do the things that I mentioned
I wanna benefit from this friendship
I wanna get the late-night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I

[Hook: Drake]
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
There's nothing left to do

[Verse 1: Kenan]
Angel in a black dress (yep)
It's backless
Diamonds on her necklace
Tonight was the night and I was on her checklist

She such a great actress...
When she say she love me

She a devil in disguise
But the truth just compromised

[and] I don't know who you are
I thought you were my star
I thought with you we'd go far

But we weren't secured
Wellsfargo
What about the trouble we endured
How deeep are m bars gonna go


Sweet smell of misery
Everyday was a mystery
I guess that-I guess that I couldn't see through your wizardry

[Hook: Drake]
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
There's nothing left to do



[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh
(Don't do that..)

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'


[Pre-Chorus]
Black leather glove, no sequins
Buckles on the jacket, it's Alyx shit
Nike crossbody, got a piece in it
Got a dance, but it's really on some street shit
I'ma show you how to get it

[Chorus]
It go right foot up, left foot, slide
Left foot up, right foot, slide

Won't stop, woah, yeah, never stop
Got so many opps, I be mistakin' opps for other opps
Got so many people that I love out of troubled spots
Other than the family I got, it's either you or me

This life got too deep for you, baby
Two or three of us about to creep where they stayin'

[Verse 2]
Toosie slide, then I hit it double-time
Then I hit a spin 'cause we spun their block a couple times
If it's not the right time, there'll always be another time
I'm not even trippin', we'll just see 'em in the summertime, woah, yeah
Can't describe the pressure I be puttin' on myself, yeah
Really, I just can't afford to lose nobody else, yeah
If they movin' shaky, we'll just do this shit ourselves, woah

Bitches takin' pictures because every night's a photo op

[Verse 1: Drake]
I talk gray, I don't keep it white and black
Only say "I love you" just so I can hear it back
Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back
Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max
To the max, no
Like the album just went platinum, yeah
Turnt up to the max
If they pop somebody's chain, then we gotta get it back
No discussion to be had, we ain't goin' out like that
Man, we lit

They wanna see me laid out on a stretcher
Gotta keep my head up
(Get 'em right, get 'em right
What you finna do, Gus?)
Now all of a sudden, people say we cousins
I keep hearin' all this "You my brother" talk, I can't relate to nothin'
My broski down to ride
Made a knot in the line
You can never break ties
We don't really rate those yutes there
That's a whole other side
That's a whole 'nother vibe
They ain't really on shit, yeah

Drizzy, we here, we in the buildin

Lay go...

Drake

Who else really tryna fuck with Hollywood shows
I’m with Marley G ho
Fly hardly grown chicks to my hardly good shows
And I wanna tell you suttin that you brolly don’t know
Dis that warthog millionaire collar bread flow n uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ma real friends take a hearing from me, fake friends turn a cold shoulder when they listen to me
But I don’t walk with you’s, I got heads in crews
I got my dick purple, from all these sexy boo’s
You gotta talk fast, if you want my love
But if you not talkin, you can catch a slug
See I been around, now I’m at the top
And all these sexy bitches, callin me hot and top
Caught a plane out, and fell asleep on it, so now I’m dreamin of bein fly
But I ain’t the nigga doping on the other guys

O-Rock

Just bought my niggas some cane, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumpin’ the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I’m forgiven for carin’ ’bout how they livin’
And loanin’ a little money and keepin’ ‘em out of prison
I ain’t lyin’ in my verses I’m just telling you the basics
Of growin’ up with your friends and becoming the one that made it, Yes lord!
All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talkin’ bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worry ’bout your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin’ like our collars up
And good ain’t good enough, and your hood ain’t hood enough
Spend my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up
Ain’t no telling when I go, so there ain’t shit that I’mma wait for
I’m the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for


With today being the 5th anniversary of So Far Gone I figured it's fitting to return to it's place of its origin in order to clear the air about an extremely emotional day. I completely support and agree with Rolling Stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication. My frustration stemmed from the way it was executed. The circumstances at hand are completely justifiable (on the magazines behalf), but I was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating. They ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not. I would have waited until it was my time because I understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but I just wasn't given that option and that made me feel violated. I apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would I ever want to offend the Hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment. I am still the same person. Today I was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly. These days are the worst ones. Waking up after a great night in the studio and it's your day to be picked apart. After dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time. So here I am having that moment. I once again apologize to everybody who took my cover comments the wrong way. I respect Rolling Stone for being willing to give a kid from Toronto a shot at the cover. I guess this is a day to learn and grow.

Sincerely,

The Boy

(Butterfly Effect)
Raw cone tucked got my eyes low
I’m Tryna roll joints with my eyes closed
I’m Tryna talk M’s on my IPhone
So when Niggas talk down get a dial tone (aye)

Greatness is due for debate
Been on some shit that you boys can’t relate
Came thru dripped like wet stuff
Kidd got the Sauce, tell em other niggas ketchup

We up in game now these niggas, they done messed up
We was in the A, mе and Jay tryna stretch dubs
Now we in the Bay rollin еighths, getting necks rubs
She want me to vote but I told her ass to bless up

I don’t like Trump, but I don’t like Biden either
I don’t trust politics both sides are evil
From a place where it’s race that divide the people
But I’m killing rap niggas, We ain’t tied or equal
(look)

(Sicko Mode)
I gotta stop at the bank
We all want burgers I’m feeding the gang
Lil shorty gon’ serve me, you know why I’m here
But I’m good in the sprite I want fries with that shake


Don’t want no receipt if yo’ number ain’t on it We the Savin the trees unless we blowin dank
Make sure that my bacon is crispy cause
Ima lil picky and Ima be back if it ain’t

I’m at the window, you know how we rockin
What’s poppin you know who it be
They call me Kidd but i feel like the man
And I know that They mad I just say “se la vie”

Ima shoot stars that nobody can reach
If you want a verse, it’s gone come with a fee
Smile in my face but talk shit when I leave
So I don’t really care who ain’t fuckin with me

All my life I had to grind, I mix that grind in with some grit
Rick told me no matter what Lil cuz, don’t ever fuckin quit
Go make your move don’t wait for no one,  know one day you gon’ be lit
So For this life I cannot change and for my fam I never switch

I Been Ballin like I’m Harden but i promise ain’t no flop in me
Get up in the game and treat this shit like it’s monopoly
Free up all my brothers take a chance and buy some property
A Man a myth? Whatever Bitch a legends what I got a be

Back to the stu to try the food the shits official
Kill the fries, the shake was fire it surprised me just a little
Went heavy on the onions, I ain’t trippin I just peel em
Bit the burger bacon crispy but this bitch forgot my pickles (Fuck)



[Round 1: Hollohan]
Grown man bars, that’s something you gotta deal with
No matter how many times you use that catchphrase
We’ll still know you’re a real bitch
See I’m the same man on or off the camera
You was propaganda
Real life; lots of manners, proper grammar, do whatever the doc asks ya
I’m getting lean, no strength machines
I mean promethazine with the jolly ranchers
Come on my strip I’ll take ya top off like exotic dancers
I T-Rex, get eaten alive here by these Toronto Raptors
Become a fossil after, I don’t even know why you spit bro
So since you can’t bust a rhyme (Busta Rhyme)
Then I’ma eat em like you Flipmode
So Gimme Some Mo cuz “This shit Dangerous" Rex
So Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See yo I’ma Break Ya Neck”
I was in ya car Rex, with a girl that T bone
You know giving me a ride
Nah bring it back, you’ll be in a car wreck when ya T bone
So it’s only right I hit it on the side
I’ll have Randy's family drown, buried where they can’t be found
Like I just got a camera for a gift, I can’t put that cannon/Canon down
See that first can hit em with a slap, you still stand your ground
T too small, the second hand close/clothes like hand-me-downs
You say you rolling with Dot Mob they’re bitches
Bunch of Smack rappers crossing borders, they’re snitches
You see this rat get stripped ass naked, bare witness
You just as delusional as him if you believe anything he saying thought
This guy gets all his world news from the Grand Theft Auto radio
I got that hardcore crew with short fuses, we’re sore losers
Of course shooters we Jedi Mind force users
I’m the reason for my torn future, sworn looper
We storm troopers like George Lucas and you’re useless
Laughing while you messed the fuck up like porn bloopers
See bringing Mook with you, it clearly didn’t help
So do what you do best and start embarrassing yourself, Rex

[Round 1: T-Rex]
Grown man bars, something he gotta deal with
No matter how many of them times he fuck with them Canada drugs
He need to come to Harlem to get some real shit
Blackout 5, you know they had to have me in the spot
A nigga that’ll sneak up on you while you put the key in the lock
I pull it out and then squeeze it and… shoutout to Organik
You done brought the King Of the Dots to the King Of The Dot
This nigga beating me? Not a chance
This shit is sorta like a fumble, it done got outta hand
I’ll pick it up, cock it.. wait, wait, wait…
This shit gon be like Hitman loading up a gun
All you gon see is bullets in Holla hand (Hollohan)
I couldn’t bring my hammer on the flight now
But it’s a guarantee my Dot Mob niggas is crossing that Canada bridge
Right now
And every gun that they got been cleaned off, wiped down
Cuz I been waiting to kill me a white nigga since Mike Brown
This nigga beating me? You think I came all the way this far to lose? Not!
Especially to a overhype nigga that smoke moon rocks
4-5th so big, it’ll make the moon rock
Let off a few shots, send that nigga to the boondocks
This ratchet that I carry don’t come out a toolbox
I’ll have doctors repairing his soul/sole like a shoe shop
The options I’ma give em… Boom! Boom! Boom! Bop!
I promise you gon see a BIG murder like Mook popped(?)
I be feeling like Delonte West when it’s time to squeeze mine
Cuz with this ratchet I’m packing I could hit the King moms
See I’m leaving with this nigga head
I give the white people permission to say it… THIS NIGGA DEAD!

[Round 2: Hollohan]
You brought ya crew, and Mook I give you props dog
You the king of the Dot Mob
Well let me introduce you to the King Of The Dot Mob
See this bitch is a fake
You ain’t here to support Rex, this Toronto you just dickriding Drake
See the date of my birth place, dark skies, earthquakes
I find it fucked up, but everyone knows you a Nurse aye
Well first off your firstborn gonna need first aid
Have Randy son in the hospital like take ya kid to work day
See Top 5 ya name don’t show up like a private number
In my world T-Rexes don’t exist like a bible thumper
Wait, now I get it, T-Rex, this bitch so sloppy
Them lil ass arms on this big old body
See I’ve been destined to be dead or in prison
But tonight I’m sent on a mission
Leaving Rex hard to look at like a head-on collision
I always got a little buzz
I’ll have him shitting blood while I hit em with the snub
Put a couple in em, another couple in em
Fuck it another couple in em, call it a swingers club
Anything in arms reach could be a murder weapon
You saying all my dogs Nazis, German Sheppards
But scars last forever like a first impression
Your intestines on the floor when you spilling ya guts
Out in front of God like a church confession
Organik, he didn’t even pay me to rap, I’m a hired goon
Shit’s real, keep ya lips SEALed, Heidi Klum
Cuz I? I’ll kill a man in Stone Cold blood
For a kilogram of home grown bud
You crazy, better wish that they don’t phone us
Cuz we’ll get busy (Bizzy) in the flesh like some old Bone Thugz
It ain’t classified information, I’m Nova Scotia’s most sick
That can under my shirt in the club like I’m going to the smoke pit
So winning Total Slaughter for your career, it clearly didn’t help
Do what you do best, keep embarrassing yourself Rex

[Round 2: T-Rex]
I admit, last time niggas saw me
I wasn’t the same Rex that y’all was used to seeing
But in 15 years I finally dropped the ball once, shit I’m a human being
I wasn’t myself at all, you could see it
Cuz what you used to seeing is Rugers squeezing
Bunch of pipes smoking like it’s a Hookah meeting
I ain’t one of them niggas to get involved with
Whenever I get into some long shit you’ll see them 4s spit
Any nigga could die when you walkin into that large stick
Cuz I can guarantee you I’m taking you to a mosh pit
A lot of niggas talk battle but they ain’t bout that
That shit you always say in ya rhymes show me you bout that
I caught him with that hammer that’s cocked like “where ya house at?”
All that shit you talking, that hammer be where ya mouth at
A lot of niggas die talking that real shit
I’m from a real borough where niggas done came and killed shit
45 on him, run up on you and spill shit
I got some dope for you, give you that Yung Ill shit
I ain’t come to Canada to lose nigga
I came to Canada just to abuse niggas
Me and Mook against you and Pat Stay
We could do it, a two on two nigga
Kill you on camera, put this body on the news nigga
Ask about me I blast shit, we could get into some real drama
If that’s really what you want to happen
But I’m representing for New York just not Manhattan
Where Dizaster at? Tell em we could squash all that Math shit
See I’m leaving with this nigga head
Y’all niggas know how I give it up… THIS NIGGA DEAD!

[Round 3: Hollohan]
I know in my battles sometimes
I glorify being a junkie and meth abuser, I stay noble
Some people online like to gossip and spread rumors
Against Clips they say I dissed Bruce for reaction
Like I’m some pathetic loser
He was looking down laughing
Who better than his best friend to know his sense of humor
And you ain’t no OG, you just old enough to be my dad and shit
You ain’t pushing white or stacking bricks
This pussy’s life’s action-less like a Women’s Rights Activists
He admitted he never owned a gun, but we was out last night
Shit, you pro-abortion, he ain’t about that life
See me, I’m straight hustling, the fiends serve em heavy
Don’t make me hold that Big Mac out like I’m Cheeseburger Eddie
Flip green through the days, spend the night at ya crack seller
This Son of Anarchy shoot at his mother head, Jack’s teller
There’s guns everywhere, couple in the leather jackets
My homie keeps the chopper under his hat like Inspector Gadget
I lugged ya body cross the country in the winter man
Chop ya family tree and let it crush you in the timber-land
I stomp a hole so bad in T-Rex ruined a boot
Straight up, Canadian round a bout, I roond-aboot
I spit a verse, you could watch how fast ya clique disperse
With them weak rhymes they say T died like a hippie shirt
In a stick up you the first to hand me ya paper, my best student
Make you cough up the green like ya phlegm’s putrid
Rex stupid, trying to guess how many blades that Jeff using
Just 3 in the front, still 1 in the back, Gillette Fusion
It’s always 3-0’s with me, no doubt it would be a massacre
Cause in the end I’ll just keep dumping, call it finale of The Bachelor
Reality shows I’m the Ultimate Fighter
You find out, get smothered, we know who be the Survivor
You ain’t that Big Brother
See all these rats in this Amazing Race
Better search for the exits and plan your great escape
Shooters surround you while you sleeping, you should’ve stayed awake
It’ll open up his eyes when I give em The Sign like Ace Of Base
All I hear is gun bars 'we want gun bars,' but it’s subpar
Man I’m that genius on it, to see this gay club you want drug bars
Middle of the night, light of the fridge when you look for snacks
Have that burner smoking in the kitchen like I’m cooking crack
Beautiful weapons, hot knives
See I don’t need the gun tonight, the blade's red
Like smoking hash on the oven off a butter knife
So how can you be the face of URL?!
When since birth I bang needles, smoke pipe
I should be running the Ultimate Rap League
Cause I been on Smack my whole life!

[Round 3: T-Rex]
I’m a lil serious when I rap so I ain’t got no joke for ya
I wish they could cut the cameras off when I say this shit
But since we in the same hotel I got some coke for you
Fuck it you want gun bars? Them bullets spitting like they on fast forward
Shot em in slo-mo, shit I was too fast for it
Silencer on Halloween, the hammer got a mask on it
We don’t deal with no corn beef unless it’s hash on it
We let them triggers blow, let ya niggas know
My niggas sold so much birds we walk pigeon toed
Rain, sleet, we be in the snow, getting rid of snow
Grew up broke, only thing for dinner was a dinner roll
I understand why they did this battle this way
You wanted it to be like… street nigga versus a crack- like aight cool
This is the hustler vers’ the customer
He was the aggressive crackhead that be on the corner like
“I don’t want that shit Rex got, I’m waiting till that butter come!
This nigga kinda diesel, fuck it Mook
We ain’t gon try and give him a one on one
But fine, we gon swing from both sides like Double Dutch
Niggas tell me that this guy was real
He got the squeezers in the palm
Kinda tough where he from, they believe em, he a don
Well not me, I run up on him and put the heater to his moms
They won’t be able to save em
Cuz they’ll find em dead in a chair with a needle in his arm
You think I came here to talk some junk shit?
Well I’m from the block, I really came here to talk some coke shit
I know you gon feel it cuz I’m talking some dope shit!
They brought me to King Of The Dot just to tell you about the crack I got
Took me a minute to get through customs
They damn near found the pack I got
He the type of nigga that’s playing defense so he wanna block my rock
But I ain’t gon let a nigga get a chance to block my shot
“Too-too… boop boop!” from the Glock I got
T with me “Chalaka-budabahbahbop!”
Make em fall all on the floor from the Glock I got
Daylyt with me, a nigga can’t Dot my Mob
I ain’t no joking ass nigga
I ain’t one of these regular rapping smoking ass niggas
And I ain’t gon be wrestling with this Hulk Hogan ass nigga
See I’m leaving with this nigga head
Y’all already know my slogan… THIS NIGGA DEAD!


[Verse 1]
Yeah
Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys-forever, hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

[Chorus]
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga


[Verse 2]
Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch, check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

[Chorus]
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga



[Verse 1: Drake & Quavo]
Yeah!
Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys, forever-hold-a-grudge" song

Nigga, "just-because" song (Migo!)
Damn!

[Chorus: Quavo]
In the hood, you earn your stripes (stripes!)

They sayin' we made our own million dollars (M&Ms!)
At the top right now, I wanna order up a million bottles (woo!)
We came from juug in the Impala to smashin' them models (juug!) (smash!)
We independent, we don't need none of your major dollars (QC!) (go!)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Flippin' and whippin' and spinnin' the dope
I'm hittin' the door
I wrap it in package, I'm shippin' the dope
Run off with the the dope, I'm killin' that ho!
I'm takin' a trip to the Bahamas, going to pick up them commas
And when I touchdown I'll hop in a Zonda
Smokin' on good marijuana in Mexico, call that quintana
Tryna fuck me a Rihanna
Comin' up, just me and Benji
Get rich or die try' like I'm 50
No cupid them bitches be kissin'
The feds they listen, them bricks in the kitchen!

[Chorus: Quavo]
In the hood, you earn your stripes
Like Olympics got gold medal

Young nigga won trappin' a grammy

[Verse 4: Offset]
Sellin' a Grammy like Tony (Montana!)
Now I want Grammys and ceremonies
These niggas snakin', always actin' funny
Got the MAC-11, call it macaroni
Always gettin' trophies and recreation
QC the label, the solid foundation
Sittin' at home I was contemplating
Changing and switch up my situation
Tryna see the bigger picture
Pull up to the award show in my new Fisker
No it ain't no money issue
Grant all my momma's wishes
Watchin' her son on the channel
I won me a Grammy and mansion, I want me a Phantom
My nigga we next up, these niggas
They copy the swag, but no they not better than us

[Chorus: Quavo]
In the hood, you earn your stripes
Like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me
I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy
In the hood, you earn your stripes
Like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me
I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy


**Lyrics from snippet**

[Verse]
Guess I got the mind of a little man
[Bras] are like women, about how you hit a man
Then she tell a story, this shit kinda bitter man
This is a nut [?], about how you did it man
You never hit, so you feel like a silly man
She never mention the spot that you fillin' in
She keep on tellin' your friends, your head in a spin
You can't even win, your head in a dance
She won't let it in, you spend it on her, she spend it on him
You see a check, then you see a grand
As soon as you speak, I pace as [?]
A face in the sand, a face [?] her man
And ya'll take your pictures, save it a chance
She call you a name, you scratchin' your chin
Like who is this nigga man, who is a [?]
You finally get it, you catchin' ahead
Suckin' your head, I'm far out the wing
And she tried to vent 'bout she wasn't in
How she really good, how she ain't a pimp
Then you take her back, she do it again
The story are, niggas are really a wimp, ey

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about it, talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (Woo)
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

You know, don't you?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it


[Chorus: Maya Jane Coles]
You know, don't you?
Yeah
Night of
You know, don't you?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!

You know, don't you?

No one gives a shit about some thieves and a baby

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah

So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches

Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh


[Bridge]
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

[Chorus]
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected
People just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
They just wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town

Chorus: (x4)
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try

[Verse 2: Drake]
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..

Chorus: (x4)




[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
All this weed in my system ain't helpin' (ain't helpin')
And this drank got you lookin' so good (so good)
I got some mollies in my hand, I might take one (take one)
And after I finish what's in my cup
You know I'm tryna love you
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I just wanna shoot a movie with a chick from out the movies
With a big old ghetto booty that know how to roll a doobie
I just wanna hit the club, throw some money on the stage
I just wanna tip a stripper more dough than she ever made
More dough than she ever seen, now she see me in her dreams
All that ass, shawty bust it, how she stuff it in her jeans (Damn)
Must run in her genes, I just wanna meet her momma
I just wanna smoke my presidential Juicy J Obama
Juicy J that OG, I been ballin' this whole week
Stuntin' 20 years plus, I can do this in my sleep
I just wanna fall in Onyx with a fine Georgia peach
Got that rocket in my pocket, that's that beauty and the beast

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
All this weed in my system ain't helpin' (ain't helpin')
And this drank got you lookin' so good (so good)
I got some mollies in my hand, I might take one (take one)
And after I finish what's in my cup
You know I'm tryna love you
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 2: Drake]
Legendary, love you so much it's unnecessary
Like it's always two weeks into February
You can take that shit to the cemetery, til we're dead and buried
But girl God forbid I feel too alive
Around you I got too much pride
Do we let it breathe or put a title on it?
I'm so indecisive, I'll let you decide
She like nah seem like your chakra's off
I'm like nah it's just that your top is off
And I started out wantin' to talk to you
And now all I can think about is poppin' off
Girl you're all that matters
You in bra and panties, that's automatic
You straddled me, I started fallin' backwards
Don't worry about the phone you can call them after
Bout to take ya down

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
All this weed in my system ain't helpin' (ain't helpin')
And this drank got you lookin' so good (so good)
I got some mollies in my hand, I might take one (take one)
And after I finish what's in my cup
You know I'm tryna love you
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you
Okay, okay, okay, okay

Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

[Verse 1: Drake]
Squad goin' up
Nobody flippin' packs now
I just did three in a row
Them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle
I don't take them shits but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think
How we had the club going up


[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
Goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
Workin' Monday night
On the corner flippin' hard
Made at least three thousand
On the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think


[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

[Bridge: ILoveMakonnen]
It ain't no way, no how
I made it on my own
I made my own style
I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta go
Been moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Got the club goin' up

[Hook]
Got the club going up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut, and she ain't choosey
Club goin up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut, and she ain't choosey
Club goin up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut, and she ain't choosey
Club goin up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut, and she ain't choosey
Club goin up

Got the club going up

[Hook]

Got the club going up

[Verse]
Always workin' OT, overtime and outta town
Things is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around

Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle, I don't take them shits
But you do, so I got ‘em

Got the club going up, on a Tuesday

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Game]
Squad goin' down, I’m at Supperclub
Girls pointing at my table, tryna fuck with us
They know we goin' up, cause it's Tuesday
She off a xanny and they bought to play that Boosie
I told her fuck it up, here go a shot of D'usse
Now go and back that ass up to this Juve
And let a nigga hit
(He ain't gotta know you going home with me)
I told that girl to, strip
You can hit the weed (But don't fall asleep on me)
You about to get this dick
It's too late to try to back down (back down)
She said tell Drizzy this my shit (shit)
I'ma tell him later, lay your ass down (remember)
'Cause them legs going up..

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

Ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, "Bring the juice, we about to get lit"
Fill the room up with some "tings", one night off and this is it
Always workin' OT, overtime and outta town
Shit is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around

[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Intro]
Yeah, alright, yeah

[Verse 1]
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

[Verse 2]
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

[Outro]
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us


(Since deleted)
I never commented on Yeezus for my interview portion of Rolling Stone. They also took my cover from me last minute and ran the issue

(Since deleted)
I'm disgusted with that. RIP to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All respect due. But the press is evil

I'm done doing interviews for magazines. I just want to give my music to the people. That's the only way my message gets across accurately



Drake: The first million is the hardest.

T. Boone Pickens: The first billion is a helluva lot harder RT @Drake: The first million is the hardest.

Drake: @boonepickens just stunted on me heavy.




[Verse 1: Divine Brown]
Sometimes I need you
Sometimes I don't
Sometimes I'll take the time to hang with you
Sometimes I won't
See I'm just the kinda girl who, loves her space
But you always take it to heart when I pull
Away from your embrace

[Pre-Chorus: Divine Brown]
No I can't talk now
Oh you can't come in
When the day is done I'll tell you
Just where I stand, stand, stand, stand, stand...

[Chorus: Divine Brown]
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear

[Verse 2: Divine Brown]
You said you want my lovin' like
Every day, all day
So used to bein' in control
You just can't have your way
Sometimes I'm on fire, boy, oh baby
Then I get ice cold
You say you know what you want
But you just can't crack my code, no no

[Pre-Chorus: Divine Brown]
I can't talk now
Uh uh, you can't come in
You gotta wait, baby
Just a little while longer
And I'll tell you

[Chorus: Divine Brown]
I'm just wanna think about it
Twistin'
While I twist my hair
Twistin'
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
Just give me some time, baby
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
While I twist it

[Bridge: Divine Brown]
It might take a little long, but
It might be worth your wait
If it's you and me, baby
Then we can do the damn thing
Tryna put the pressure on me
I'm gonna leave it up to faith
I know you want an answer
But you got to, got to, got to, got to wait

[Verse 3: Drake]
Sweetie I hope you're takin' the lines down
Shake it and wine 'round
Twist up to this one
It's Drake and Divine Brown
It's new and improved, no mistakin' from afar
You just do what you do and I'll be waitin' in the car
Aw you can twist it up (yup), and you can let it flow (yup)
You can pull it back or leave it and let it grow (yup)
Braid it and put it under fleece in the winter
Just never slang it back with the piece in the center
Dudes be like, "Baby, boo let's go"
It take 'em time to get cute homie, you best know
I'm hot without a, you guess, oh
Cause I reside up north and ain't forcin' a U.S. flow
You heard?

[Chorus: Divine Brown]
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
I'm gonna twist my hair
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
If it's more than I can bear, baby
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
See I like my independence
But right now, listen
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
I don't know
Say do I need a relationship?
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
Or do I need to be single?
Ooh baby, baby
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear

[Intro]
Yeah, more, yeah

[Verse]
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still, they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, "This what we need to be on," but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge
I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, "What have you done for me lately?"
"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest."
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?



[Intro: Kaash Paige]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: 24kGoldn]
I told him, "Forget shawty that you thought you had
'Cause she's waitin' for me, nigga, that's my bad"
If I said, "I want you", could we make that last?
If I said, "I loved you", would you say that back?

[Chorus: 24kGoldn & Kaash Paige]
That's unbelievable
'Cause I'm shooting for the stars, baby, tryna make it large
That's unachievable
What they been sayin' all my life, but they never got it right
That's unbelievable (Unbelievable)
And I'm feelin' so close, tryna live what I know (Unbelievable)
That's unbelievable
That they hated all my life, but they never got it right, no

[Verse: Kaash Paige & 24kGoldn]
They said I'ma be big (Oh)
I'm like, "How they like with this music shit?" (Oh)
Be in the studio, pray I'ma be rich (I'ma be rich)
In place with my next bitch
We screaming, "Fuck the money that you think you had" (Think you had)
'Cause that means nothing to what we have (Yeah)
Top 100 making niggas mad (Yeah)
Pull up to the function, Benjis in my bag
I'm balling, I'm balling (I'm balling)
I'm balling on you (Balling on you)
The labels keep calling (Calling)
I can't pick and choose (I can't pick and choose)
The ladies, they love me (They love me)
They love what I do (They love what I do)
Tryna come kick it
Come chill at the stu' (Come chill at the stu')

[Pre-Chorus: 24kGoldn]
I told him, "Forget shawty that you thought you had
'Cause she's waitin' for me, nigga, that's my bad"
If I said I want you, could we make that last?
If I said I loved you, would you say that back?

[Chorus: 24kGoldn, with Kaash Paige]
That's unbelievable (Unbelievable)
'Cause I'm shooting for the stars, baby, tryna make it large
That's unachievable (Unachievable)
What they been sayin' all my life, but they never got it right
That's unbelievable (Unbelievable)
And I'm feelin' so close, tryna live what I know (Unbelievable)
That's unbelievable (Unbelievable)
They been hatin' all my life, but they never got it right, no




[Intro: Trey Songz]
Yeah Man (Aye)
You already know what it is (Aye)
Trey called Trigga (Aye)
Aye man (Aye)
Show them why you rappin' homie (Aye)
Look

[Hook: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Just copped new shoes
Whip on two two's
Dick down you two
Throw it on YouTube
Tell me what you'd do
If I was to do you
Baby after one time
Sure to make you come back
Back like spinal, stack like dominoes
Catch me out in Mexico
Hasta mañana though, hasta la vista
Chest full of reefer
Rep for my set till the day I meet the Reaper
Petersburg veteran
USA resident
In USA Today it ain't a city I ain't never been
Scared I ain't never been
Yea I ain't never been
Nothing but a underdog
But I'm never under ya'll
Still keep it under there
Right by the underwear
Still in the hood yeah
I ain't talking outerwear
They be moving powder there
Which one of you out of there
Wanna get it
Cause I'm with it
Fuck ya'll, the underdog

[Hook: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

[Verse 2: Drake]
Said I got my city buzzin
You should take a trip and view it
Shout out to Mr.Rogers
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it
And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it ain't a Buick
I never rendezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the fuck you wanna do it
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it
I would say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I fuck with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drop it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
And girl I heard your man a fed, don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city, got 'em open like the lock is gone
Keys out, I ain't talking white though
Baby what you be's 'bout
I mean for tonight hoe
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty

[Hook: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight
Uh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot but I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, "Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways


[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance
Sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper
That's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways


[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)



[Intro: Aaliyah]
Let me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever, I haven’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I’m single, thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just

[Chorus: Young Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang
(Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say "for life,” y'all say "forever"
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’ma need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talkin' his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her name's the game

[Chorus: Young Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang
(Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Outro: Young Jeezy & Aaliyah]
Got my top dropped on this beautiful night
It's a beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got 'em lil brah, unforgettable
You’ll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable
Let me know, let me know


*Lyrics from Snippet*

Unfortunate, I think you notice something missing
But you never say shit

[Verse 1: Drake]
My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ahem, my name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over-stand me
I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit, like, "a-la-la-lollipop"
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I freak that pussy better
Better than her gynecologist, ho just
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick, old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damn, all I got is one dick

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie


[Bridge: Santigold]
I got the talk, the beat and bass
Give me one, I'll take it, make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace
I break it, break it you can't stop me in this ra-race

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Spoken Outro: Chris Paul]
Yo what up? It's Chris Paul, CP3, feel my man Drake, So Far Gone, Drake, I gotchu homie, I gotchu. Let's get 'em

Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Whose it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now

You give me a feeling that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready

I know you once said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting
So why wait for eventually?
If we gon' do somthing bout it
We should do it right now


You give me a feeling that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready

Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready



[Verse 1]
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight, who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me

[Verse 2]
I know you said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?
If we gonna do something about it, we should do it right now
(We should do it right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Sayin'
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (Fly away)
I can't say, I can't compare
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

[Chorus]
I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)




[Spoken Intro]
This next song is, like, one of my favorite, favorite songs
And um, this song ended up coming off soul conversation that was so intimate
Even the way that I sang on the mic
It was like maybe the lowest and the quietest that I ever sang
But it felt, like, so personal
And I wanted it to feel like I was just whispering in somebody's ear

And the question is: What are we waiting for?

[Verse 1]
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right herе
And tell you all that comes to me
And if you havе something to say
You should say it right now
(You should say it right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

[Chorus]
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)

[Verse 2]
I know you once said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be"
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually?
'Cause if we gon' do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now)
Bay, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

[Chorus]
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready
(I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)
Yeah, yeah

[Interlude]
My favorite part is this bridge
Because we sat and we talked about what this meant for a while, you know
We spoke about, like, why give up before we try
So many times — how many times have we just count ourselves out before we even give it a chance?
You know, why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs, you know
We — everybody does that, I do that
Clip our wings before we fly away
We sat there and spoke about this bridge for a long time
To really get, like, that feeling, that feeling, yeah, uh
So this bridge is like my favorite in this song, I love where it goes
Say, say, say

[Bridge]
Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (Fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me

[Chorus]
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)
Yeah, if you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)
Oh yeah, if you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready
(I'm ready)

[Outro]
Thank you




[Intro: Alicia Keys]
If you ask me, I'm ready...

[Verse 1: Drake & Alicia Keys]
Ugh, Tez keeps tellin' me he just turned 30
Havin' dreams of bein' single forever, he's gettin' worried
And I'm scared too, 'cause I'm in the same boat
Good women are rare too, none of them have came close
Me I haven't changed much, you know how I play it
Better safe than sorry
'Stead of searchin' for substance at every single party
Baby, bein' part of this life
I feel like I'm bound to end up with somebody that's been with everybody
I need you to rescue me from my destiny
I'm tryna live right and give you whatever's left of me (yeah)
'Cause you know life is what we make it
And a chance is like a picture, it'd be nice if you just take it
Or let me take it for you, I'm just down to ride
Or we can roll around the city 'til you finally decide
I've got more than a thing for you, tattoo and an ink for you
Right over my heart, girl, I'll do the unthinkable

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys & Drake]
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have somethin' to say
You should say it right now
You should say it right now
You ready?

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Drake]
You give me a feelin' that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
I deserve it, I think I deserve it, let it go
It's becoming somethin' that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I can't take it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
I know you once said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be"
Time is only wastin', so why wait for eventually?
If we gon' do somethin' 'bout it
We should do it right now
We should do it right now
Baby, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Drake]
You give me a feelin' that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
I deserve it, I know I deserve it, let it go
It's becoming somethin' that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Yeah, yeah
Sing...
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)

But can you take it, oh




[Verse 1: Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying "you should quit", cars saying "fuck your life"
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches (yeah)
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Drizzy say get her, I'ma get her
I got the kind of money, make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like "yes" and you like "no"
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj & Drake]
I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch (uhh)
Aww, aww, aww
Aww yeah we in this bitch
Aww, aww, aww

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww




[Intro: Piano Instructor]
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to our annual recital here at the U.P.A., Urban Pianist Association. Here is the most talented student in my class, Aubrey Drake Graham. It has taken a long time for him to get to this point. Do not get me wrong, he’s not perfect, but he has come a long way since my meeting with his mother. He has made improvement! So Aubrey, show these people what you got man!

[Sidebar (to Drake): Piano Instructor]

[Piano Solo: Drake]

[Sidebar (to Drake): Piano Instructor]

I got you on a verse, Saweetie what you need me on?

I could buy a house, but I stash for my show, yeah, yeah
New Ferrari, yeah, I'm up now
Plus I own the liquor company in my cup now
Stillhouse, that's what's up now (yee)
It's really no limit, 'cause I don't really give a fuck now (Stillhouse)
I hear people runnin' their mouth
I only moved 350 miles south
I got my credentials, they know what I'm 'bout
I've been validated, I ain't even gotta say it, yeah
Hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy

[Chorus: Saweetie]
All my niggas yeah we up now (all my niggas yeah we up now)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, "Drake is just a younger you"
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you, bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout?
Young Mula, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

If I don’t know your momma, I'mma make him feel it
Heavy Armor-All, you know I wanna shine
Bitch, I need it all, each and every dime

We let 'em stare, but we don't see them niggas
We don't see them niggas

[Chorus: Lil Reese]

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it


[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 2: Drake]
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
Y'all don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
Y'all don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy


[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch


[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to (What you say?)
Like I
Take some to getting used to (What you say?)
Man, they don't love you like they used to, man



[Intro: RiFF RAFF & Drake]
Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker
Boys playin' PlayStation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at

Take some to getting used to (What you say?)
Man, they don't love you like they used to, man
And I'm so sorry
Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together—motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this? How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions? We ain't doing no interview!

Be honest to yourself, don't you never pretend (tell 'em)
Don't ever play yourself, know when it all begins (you know)
I had to put my back against the wall (and what?)
Tell me that I don't deserve to ball


[Chorus: Future]
Mexicano, working like I'm Mexicano
New persona, we're moving on from Ferragamo
Get the llama, I party with the real Madonna
Beat the odds, do numbers and remain humble (yeah)
Drop-top Porsches, I'm so used to this
Smoking out the pound, I'm so used to this
I know where I'm from and I got used to this
Mansion in the hills, I got used to this

[Verse 2: Drake]
Lambo come alive, man, I'm used to this
No one looks surprised cause we used to this
I'ma make sure that we get used to this
Treat my brother's kids like they one of my kids
Never looking back on it, we did what we did
Could never find the time for the people I miss
Thought they had my back against the wall
Tell me that I don't deserve to ball
Well, then tell me who deserve it
Eyes getting low but I'm still observing, I see you lurking
Never see me out in person, I'm always working
Money on your head if you make a nigga nervous
Never made a move out here unless I was certain
Tatted on me, but this shit is deeper than the surface
I'm with everyone that I was here with in the first place
Making sure that they all good before they close the curtain


[Chorus: Future]
Mexicano, working like I'm Mexicano
New persona, we're moving on from Ferragamo
Get the llama, I party with the real Madonna (yeah)
Beat the odds, do numbers and remain humble (Future)
Drop-top Porsches, I'm so used to this
Smoking out the pound, I'm so used to this
I know where I'm from and I got used to this
Mansion in the hills, I got used to this

[Outro: Future]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Hook: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Man that shit you talking raising my sodium
When I step to the podium
Like they bringing the trophy in
They like "Aww, there he go again"
I do what I got to do to ride up in that European
I knew back when I was playing Little League down at Bobian
That, that boy had that glow like he ran off with plutonium
Back when I had a crush on every girl on Nickelodeon
Man I knew I had to be in and out of Fallopian
Bank accounts at Wachovia
I can't be no custodian
Just imagine how the drama felt
Imagine how my momma felt
Swimming in the debt boy I was hungrier than ever
Ya this must be how piranhas felt
I had to put my G-Shock back on just to go remind myself
When we needed all kind of help
Back when we was all alone on our own
Now they on my phone brrrr Sean Don Corleone
Fuck every OG who passed up on my and put me on a song
Except for Ye so I'm forever repping foot up on the throne
You was popping back when I was wearing pow chains
Now you back at home, how mane?
Whole squad come together killing shit like the Power Rangers
I stay in tune and out of danger
Lady on the way Mercedes on the way
Album on the way
Rapping like I got a baby on the way
I'm like Baby with the pay
Pay me when? Today
Bitch it’s do or die, seven days a week and holidays
Ho ass bitch


[Hook: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man

Yeah
6 shit

Been with so many women I can’t even count
Bitches all borrowin my Netflix account
Messin up all of my recommendations
You know I don’t wanna watch Sense8, son!
He may be my kid but I’m not buying no family plan
12 bucks a month? I ain’t made of money, damn
Learned my lesson, thought I could trust a hoe
Gotta change the password to HBO Go
For real

[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1: Drake]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'


[Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me


[Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit



[Drake] Chorus
Versache [x35]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm an optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like "What the fuck is he planning?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin's cause business is business, it's strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out with me, no paparazzi
I'm trying give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me

(Get out of jail free card?)

[Verse 4: Tyga]
Versace, Versace, I brought that shit back, all these niggas they copy

Six mill for the mansion

So much green I turned camo
Some hoover niggas on flannels
Light light you up no candle
Grip on that handle Yosemite Sam ya, that bitch bang like a banjo
Told my arms dealer no need for a box, I don't read the instructions, I throw out the manual (WOO!)
Versace, Versace, my brother king Trell he in a Ferrari
I don't look the same, my camera the same, I made too much money (WOO!)
Paul Pierce is my neighbor, I told him he should of went to the Clippers
I got some crazy ideas for Versace, get them and tell'em my number
Versace, auggh Picasso, Basquiat I'm cocky

I don't fuck with Saddam but, that's gold all in my toilet
Statues of Horus, and Anubis is polished

I'm bout' to join the money team, just holla' to Floyd about it
Versace, Versace, I'm taking my money to the Cayman islands (WOO!) Versace Auggh!!

[Verse 5: Quavo]
Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch "Versace"
Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't ever been in the jungle
Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga don't fumble

[Verse 6: Takeoff]
You can do Truey, I do it Versace
You copped the Honda, I copped the Mazi
You smoke the mid, I smoke exotic

Cookin' this dope like I work at Hibachi
Look at the watch, blow it, hot like some Taki
Come in my room, my sheet Versace
Go to sleep, I dream Versace
Medusa, Medusa, Medusa

Rockin' handcuffs, that’s Ferragamo

[Drake: talking]
Uh, yea, get in my Slick Rick mode
N'a mean?, I'm a tell ya a Story real quick

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a


[Hook]
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a...
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same

And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[Verse 2: Drake]
My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin' directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it
I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill


[Hook]
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[Drake: speaking]
And I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
Say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
Accept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
You know as a person man. I love to see my black women strong, single
Independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
Video you n'a mean? its a wonderful thing baby. so uh, don't hate me for
This one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? cuz its like uh
And she beautiful and honey dances
And you always downtown making money transfers
And anything the color of braces she get excited
She always showing up at these places she get invited
She a video girl



[Intro: The Winans]
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
Yeah




[Produced by THC and DJ Dahi]

[Verse 1: Drake]
You must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, where Jen and Melissa
(Say Hi, M)
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
It's some views from the 6
Just some views from the 6




[Intro]
I don't care what you done, I don't care where you been
All you got do to is look over your shoulder
And look where God has walked you from
All you gotta do is look back
Just somebody look over your shoulder
Look where you come from, look where you come through
I come through the storms and rain
Look where I come from, I was down but now I'm up
Look where I come from, by the grace of God
By the goodness of God, look where I come from
Remind me where I'm from again (6ix)
Yeah, that's right, that's right
Tryna suppress the stress, you know?
Got a family tree that needs watering
A father that needs fathering
A mom that would probably prefer the whole mother-daughter thing, but we still rolling, you know?

[Verse 1]
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
They callin' my name, just another day
Can't bend, can't break
Can't let it show on my face
All of my mistakes, right there on display
All part of my story, skin thick as my shawty, yeah (Too thick shawty)
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
Is everybody safe? Carrying the weight
Tell me what it takes to get everybody straight
The money in my safe, can't buy a clean slate
Clean isn't for me anyway

[Interlude]
I don't want you to allow people to tell you that you are useless
Alright, alright, go ahead and tell 'em, go ahead and tell 'em
Because I want you to know, God told me to tell you this day "You are useful" (Tell 'em, tell 'em)
You are valuable (Yes), and you are vital (Yes), to God

[Chorus]
Vital, vital, on baby, on Bible
Remember what I left when I go
Remember what I said when I spoke
Please don't stand at my grave and cry though
I'm not there, they made it so I can never really die though
So please don't stand at my grave and cry though
Pop champagne, scream my words
Let me leave on a high note
And don't let nobody call me an idol
'Cause I was never sitting idle
And my people go where I go

[Verse 2]
Don't let nobody sell my house on the bridle
Worked too hard for the title
Worked too hard, where did life go?
Last thing I heard was Andre scream "Ice cold"
Past eight years feel like I had my eyes closed, blindfolded
Smoke before I make my decisions
That's how I take the high road
Say I never get alone time, that's a lie though
I'm still alone with everybody as far as I know

[Intro]
*Phone ringing*
You have reached, you have reached
The mailbox, mailbox

[Verse 1: Drake]
I know there’s other people that you talk to
But I just hate getting any proof shown to me, shown to me
I know there’s other places that you could go but
I'd just really love it if you made it home to me, home to me
Yeah, young girl, you love life
Same birthday as Pac, thug life
Gemini, I understand why ya uptight
'Cause once you give away the pussy, then you’re fucked right?
Yeah, I wonder if I should call you
But then again you never call me
And I’m just looking at my phone girl
And the last three messages are all me
Damn, that’s doing a lot
I mean I’ve always been the type to know when to stop
For real, I mean I want you in the worst way
And I know one day doesn’t mean the first day
Yeah and it ain’t mornin' but it’s late enough
And I just showered, I just shaved, I just straightened up
And I’m tired of the games, we done played enough
I hope you’re still coming cause I’m waitin' up


[Chorus: Riz]
All the missed calls got me thinkin'
Maybe I’m trippin’
But I want you to feel the other side (The other side)
Now I’m waitin' up (Got you waitin')
Now I’m waitin' up (Oh, got you waitin', yeah)
Now I’m waitin' up (Oh yeah)
Now I’m waitin' up, waiting up, up (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Riz]
Voicemail when I call ya phone
I know just how you feel
I know just how you feel, how you feel
Baby when you home alone
I know just how you feel (Do you know?)
I know just how you feel (Oh yeah)
Girl, now I’m waitin' up

[Verse 2: Riz]
Now the shoe is on the other foot
I’m here with my daughter
She keeps staring like her mother look (Mother look)
And the hours keeps passin'
I'm thinking about spazzin', couldn’t even imagine
Her catchin' up with her passed friend
Sayin' how was and he askin', a has-been
Has been shady, then she tellin' her she hate me
And she been would’ve left if it wasn’t for the baby
I know it sound crazy (That wasn’t the plan)
You see I’m just a young boy (That’s raising a man)
Listen look I’m really sorry for (Raising my hand)
All the false allegations (I’m taking a stand)
Damn, damn, how did we get here?
Girl, it's feeling like the end isn’t near
You say you don’t care
I just hope it's out of anger
Good girl gone bad, I can’t blame ya
Signs read danger (I open my eyes)
Girl, you saying that you pregnant, I’m hopin' its lies
While they all sound true, it’s sad girl, the things that I do
They all affect you
Like they don’t affect me
Girl, I’m mad cause the things you can’t see
It’s what it’s gon’ be (I’m makin' a change)
The best thing we ever had, we take it in vain


[Chorus: Riz]
All the missed calls got me thinkin'
Maybe I’m trippin’
But I want you to feel the other side (The other side)
Now I’m waitin' up (Got you waiting)
Now I’m waitin' up (Oh, got you waiting, yeah)
Now I’m waitin' up (Oh yeah)
Now I’m waitin' up, waiting up, up (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Riz]
Voicemail when I call ya phone
I know just how you feel
I know just how you feel, how you feel (Ooh yeah)
Baby when you home alone
I know just how you feel
I know just how you feel
Girl, now I’m waitin' up

First night, she gon' let me fuck 'cause we grown
I hit her, gave her back to the city, she home

I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps, though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
We been brothers since Versace bando, whoa

Water gon' lock it, quadruple the profit (profit)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, they try to send for me
Envy and jealousy is everything I wish upon my enemies
All that for them, right back at them
What my mind keeps telling me
Mind keeps telling me
I hear everything, I don't ask if it's all there cause it better be
Trust me it better be, no long talking or settling
Jizzzle never won no wrestling
But he's on a big bell metal ting
Streets unruly
More life for my brother's tryna better things, cause...

[Hook: Dave]
Cause all my man are running to the money
We be running like ah, ah, ah, ahhh
And all my man are running from them hoes on the roads like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

With a bat or with a pole

Nike jacket on my back I'm looking cold
It's funny how these catties wanna know, but

[Hook: Dave]
All my man are running to the money

Free shmoke
Anybody want it, they can get it, no joke
Call up Landlord, nigga that's bro

I don't run to Twitter with the things I know
I fall back just to see how it unfolds
Yeah, like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa
Years ago, they didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough
Catties they be calling up my phone
Trying to get tickets to a show
Yeah, I got U.K. tings on the WhatsApp now
Like +44 on the code

[Outro: Dave & Drake]
Yeah, like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa
A month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough
These catties they be calling up my phone
All these man dem they applaud me on the road

Man dem keep on talking on a low
Man dem keep talkin on a low, low, low

I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train


[Outro]
Ayy
Yeah
AXL (AXL), AXL (AXL), AXL (AXL)



[Chorus]

Warriors! Come Out And Play! X2
Warriors Ey Ey x3

Gd Up From The Feet Up ABCDEF

Im A G To The End The End Of The Road
But Back In The Kitchen At The End Of The Stove
Looks Like We At The End Of The O
Drop A 4 In A 20 Ounce And Call It 24
U Sit On 24s And We Sip On 24s
Got The Caddy's Sitten On A Pair Of Gucci Penny Loafs
I Get Money Fuck With Bitches That Get Me Mo
Man You Know The Plan Same Shit Different Hoes
Ya We Cut The Ears And The Tails Off
Mickey Mouse Never Been A Rat Never Had Him In The House
Call Me Captain Kangaroo But I Got Money In My Pouch
But I Don't Mean Loose Change When I Say Money In The Pouch
Ya Dig Ya
Im Getting Paid That's What I Already Said
Seek These Niggas Like To Brief On These Niggas
Got A Bitch Name Nina And Nina So Sluty
Cus She Do Him And Never One Of His

[Chorus]


[Drake]

Are You Listening? Is Anybody Listening?
Walk Into The Room And You Can Smell The Clive Christian Scent
A Lot Of Niggas Threatened My Postion And
Thrillen Bars You Think Im Writing With John Krishenpen
I Need Rossi
Never Mind The Pricing
Know We Brought Cake To The Party, No Icing
No Ice On Big Phantom No License
Fuck If You're Feeling Me As Long As Your Wife Is
No One In My City Got A Pocket Like Drizzy
I Can Rock Fitted Jeans Cuz My Credit Card Skinny
Its Pitch Black And Covers All Incidentals
And Mrs Wrong Sorry You Ain't Notice My Potential
Fuck Yall Rappers And Your Self-Proclaimed Status
I Can Only See Green Now I Happy Saint Pattys
Ya I Know Your Waiting On The Last Quote
Check The Sound Scan And You Can See Im The Last Hope


[Chorus]


[Jay-Z]

I Told You Niggas 9 10 Times Stop Fucking With Me
Put That Knife In Ya
Take A Little Bit Of Life From Ya
Am I Frightening Ya?
Shall I Continue
Put The Gun To Ya Let It Sing You A Song
I Let It Hum To Ya
The Others One Sing Along
Now It's A Duet?
Nd You Wet, When You Check Out The Technique
From The Two Teckz
And I Don't Need Two Lips To Blow This Like A Trumpet
You Dumb Shit, This Is An Unusual Musical I Conduct It
You Looking At The Black Warren Buffet
So All Critters Can Duck Sick
I Don't Care If You See The Laurens Tucket
Or You Bill O Reilly You Only Ralling Me Up
For 3 Years They Had Me Peeing Out Of A Cup
Now They Bout To Free Me Up
What You Think Im Goin Be? What? Rehabilitated?
Man I Still Feel Hatred
Im Young Black And Rich So They Wanna Strip Me Naked
But You Never Had Me Like Christina Agulari
But Catch Me Down The West Side Driving Like Halle Berry
Or The FDR In The Seat Of My Car Screaming Out The Sun Roof
Death To Ya
You Can't Kill Me I Live Forever Through These Bars
I Put The Wolves On Ya
I Put A Price On Ya Head, The Whole Hood Would Want Ya
You Starting To Look Like Bread
I Send The Boyz At You I Ain't Talking About Feds
Nigga The Body Snatchers Nigga You Heard What I Said

[Chorus]




[ DCypher Musik ]

This here's before the tip off, this is just the anthem/ before the fame, before the stage show ransoms/ I'll be demanding, for the chicks know I'm handsome/ just a ill artist on the mic but give my band some/ they tried to play me foul turned it to an and one/ crossover appeal guess that makes me The Answer/ A.I. while the push artificial intelligence/ I stay fly but I always remain a gentlemen/ and now my name got some relevance/ cuz I tackle issues and say it in a way they get/ use to play the bench but soon I'll pack stadiums/ cuz I detonate on MC's in blast radius/ I'm by myself but y'all just the Raptors/ so best believe you'll see my name in the raftors/ When its said and done, the game's chosen son/ shatter records, homie and I just begun

Chorus

I been balling for a while but nobody knew my name
But I'll tell you something real I'm the coldest in the game
Keep it true for the fans I ain't never gonna change
Get ya tickets now cuz I'm headed for the fame

8x Watch Me Ball

[ Drake ]

I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy

But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Tripping off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me

Chorus




[Intro: All Artists]
When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a waving flag

[Verse 1: K'naan]
Born from a throne, older than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone

[Nelly Furtado]
But it's my home, all I have known

[Sam Roberts]
Where I got grown, but now it's gone

[Avril Lavigne]
Out of the darkness, in came the carnage
Threatening my very survival

[Pierre Bouvier of Simple Plan]
Fractured my streets and broke all my dreams

[Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman]
Now feels like defeat to wretched retreat

[Pre-Chorus: All Artists]
So we struggling

[Kardinal Offishall]
Fighting to eat

[All Artists]
And we wondering

[Kardinal Offishall]
If we'll be free

[Jully Black]
We can not wait for some faithful day
It’s too far away so right now I’ll say

[Chorus: All Artists]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Verse 2: Lights]
So many wars, settling scores

[Deryck Whibley of Sum 41]
All that we've been through and now there is more

[Serena Ryder]
I hear them say love is the way

[Jacob Hoggard of Hedley]
Love is the answer that's what they say

[Emily Haines of Metric]
But were not just dreamers of broken down grievers

[Hawsley Workman]
A hand will reach us and will not forsake us

[Drake]
This can't control us, no it can’t hold us down

[Chin Injeti]
We gon' pick it up even though we still struggling

[Pre-Chorus: Pierre Lapointe]
Au nom de la survie

[All Artists]
And we wondering

[Pierre Lapointe]
Battant pour nos vie

[All Artists]
We patiently wait for some other day

[Fefe Dobson and Esthero]
That's too far away so right now I say

[Chorus: All Artists]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Verse 3: Drake]
How come when the media stops covering
And there’s a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling
And assume that its really all love again, nah
See we don’t have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before, it’s never too late to start
You probably think that it’s too far to even have to care
Well, take a look at where you live, what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again

[Chorus: Nikki Yanofsky]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag

[Matt Mays]
And then it goes back

[Justin Nozuka]
And then it goes back

[Nikki Yanofsky]
Then it goes back

[All Artists]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
When I get older, when I get older
I will be stronger, just like a waving flag


[Chorus: All]
We are, we are
Not your ordinary fami-mily
But we can all agree that
We are, we are
Close as close can be

[Bridge: Keke Palmer, Drake, Ester Dean]
We are are are are (We are)
We are are are are (We are)
We are are are are (We are)
We are, Family

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah]
So it don't matter what it looks like
We look perfect to me
We got every kind of love
I feel so lucky indeed
They can keep on talking
It don't matter to me cause
We are, we are family
Family, we are, we are

[Talking: Wanda Sykes & John Leguizamo]
Ham and Cheese
No! It's we are family
Nah


[Verse 2: Keke Palmer, Queen Latifah& John Leguizamo]
Ok, so the links in our chain makes us strange
But really they make us stronger
And I wouldn't replace not a thing
Mother or father (Go Manny)
Cause we

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & Jennifer Lopez]
Cause we come from everywhere (Whoa, Oh)
Searching for ones to care
Somehow we found it here
We found us a home

[Chorus: All & Ester Dean]
We are, we are
Not your ordinary fami-mily
But we can all agree that
We are, we are
Close as close can be (Be, Oh)

[Bridge: Keke Palmer, Drake, Ester Dean]
We are are are are (We are)
We are are are are (We are)
We are are are are (We are)

[Verse 4: Heather Morris & All]
We are, we are

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Been a minute since we've slept together
Finna get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s yacht, that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae


[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
This shit ain’t my fault

[Intro: Future, DJ Drama, & Drake]
Pluto!
DJ Drama!
Dram, Dram (Yeah, yeah)
Astronaut talk

[Verse 1: Drake]
Okay, you know you been on my mind, A-Town, I miss you
When ol' girl would come late and bring all her tips through
Break up her weed while I break down my issues
Get paper, she blows that, the next day, you know that
Daydream at night time I think too much
Then I hit the nightclub 'til it's daytime and I drink too much
Not time for no good girl, they hold on and they cling too much
I just want a hood bitch that tell me that I sing too much
Awww, yeah, shout out to the women playing y'all position
I be moving through my city like a politician
Hope you don't judge me cuz me and you are not all that different
You made me this way, you made me famous, you all assisted
New niggas tryna shine, I didn't condone it
But I'm back in this bitch, re-living the moment
I'm about to have it poppin off again
Drama bout to make it rain on Mary Poppins and her friends
We got....

[Chorus: Future]
We got money in our pocket, and whatever you're sipping on
Red-bottom limpin around this bitch, what the fuck you trippin on?
Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone
And they gon put you back in place if you do something wrong
We in this bitch, yeah we in this bitch, yeah
We got a section full of girls and they barely speak any English
Let's toast it up to that life and I mean it


[Verse 2: Future]
Water water all around me, damn my diamonds are shinin
Money rainin on you bitches, Future changin the climate
All I hang around is millionaires and a bunch of cons
Turn up, turn up, turn up it's like a burnt a bunch of Suns
Hah, from Milwaukee to Atlanta
They put my lifestyle on camera, they tripping, no cockin hammers
Addicted to making movies, I like em when they bougie
Anytime I step out, when I come through, it's a zoovie
Ain't rapping to ya, I'm really trapping with words
And I ain't braggin' to ya when I say I'm fly as a bird
That girl don't speak no Englo but she know all my lingo
She know a Rarri when she see one and she know a c-note
I got a Haitian girl speak Creole and a spanish girl from Rio
We could put them in a room together make a perfect combo
They bout that life, I'm bout that life, yes we is, yes we is
The money, bitches and cars come with the life that I live
It should've been a designer party, all these designer round me
Pick a name, anything, money can buy what? Diamond chain
Diamond ring, Murcielagos, Balenciagas
We toasted up to the life, niggas it's ours

[Chorus: Future]
We got money in our pocket, and whatever you're sipping on
Red-bottom limping around this bitch, what the fuck you tripping on?
Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone
And they gon put you back in place if you do something wrong
We in this bitch, yeah we in this bitch, yeah
We got a section full of girls and they barely speak any English
Let's toast it up to that life and I mean it

[Verse 1: Zay Davey]
See it used to be a struggle
Since we made it safe from our seats will unbuckle
In our heads we would worry about trouble
Like how would me make it chest deep beneath the rubble
And now we look down on it like hubble
All the haters start to mumble because we scored they fumbled
And now we just sit and chill
As we count the countless bills and we realize this is real
We're at the top to this game you jack and jilled
Never pay for shit again always have free refills
Never plain on breaking so there is no plan for rebuild
Wish i could keep this feeling forever that's how we feel
So if you're wondering if we'll be fine its yes
And if my crew is down you ain't even gotta guess
You know i love my lifestyle so you think im blessed
Being at the top is perfect because there's no more stress

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine


[Verse 2: Lazy Shirts]
I'm fine we're fine but yes of course we murder time
This beat's a corpse in the back of the room that's mine
Mess with you because you're dumb and we're just having fun
Dreams of making millions that's paper to the cieling
And i ain't saying we the shit but if you gotta
Then let them know to hit the road we taking over shows
And like a penalty i got red flags
In the sky in disguise my boys ride
I would look outside if you feel somebody's watching
Tick tock im knocking clocks in man screw a clock in
This the team and you could say we do it often
Zay Drizzy and Jerz we get it poppin

[Verse 3: Zay Davey]
You can call me superman with an S upon my chest
Never give rappers chances because I'm always at my best
I keep the comp worried like game set and match
And they wonder how they get out like where's the escape hatch
Drake already said that we'll be fine
No more take out for us we wine and dine
Never dull moments when living express line
Now watch us do our thing no need for stars aligned

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine


[Verse 3: Jerzey]
We'll be fine got my fam and my homies
What's the time gotta make sure my girl ain't lonely
Oh but i gotta remind dont forget that we the only
Greatest ones in this last year in this cuz
We be getting rich can't even make a wish
Man i swear it's like we run these kids we be throwing back our lids
What we say is what we do even if it is
Something that's too cold for you because we dont care if you freeze in this

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine



[Produced by T-Minus and Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street, got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib, goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine
We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine

[Verse 2: Drake]
Used to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man
You keep talking that, "You was this and you had this"
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, "you're such a dog", I said, "you're such a bone."
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, "show me some"
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine

[Outro: Birdman]
Yeah! Drizzy, yo' turn, nigga!
Take Care of the business, nigga (shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business, nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck 'em, we don't love 'em!
Yeah, it's just that Uptown gangsta shit
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas
Drizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?
Toast to this gangsta shit, fellas
OVO YMCMB (believe that!)
Yeah, you understand me?
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing
Throwin' hundreds, rubber band stacks
That YMCMB shit, nigga; flashy lifestyle
One hundred




[Intro 1: Eastbound & Down (Kenny Powers)]
The only thing I'm seein' I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins. We gonna have so many fuckin' fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof. Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days

[Intro 2: Soulja Boy]
Soulja Boy, Drake
Oh, we made it
Turn me up just a little bit in the headphones
Worldwide, international

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it, ayy
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, she said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007, I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!" (Go off)
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin' (Go off)
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
I'ma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"

[Interlude: Kenny Powers]
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Ayy, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it, ayy
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, if they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it
If I said it, I meant it, there's no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up, watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it (Go off)
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience (Go off)
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in yo' face and say "Nigga we made it!"
I swear that we made it, selloff that ting, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell ya, I don't need no favors (Go off)
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it!"

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Ayy, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
I remember standing in the hood
Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good
Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!
Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, two times I crashed
Ha, nigga we made it!
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it
I look a nigga in his face and say "Nigga we made it!"
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters
And these days I don't need no favors, ayy
Nigga we made it!

[Outro: Soulja Boy]
You already know man
Phone call back to the old hood, see what's goin' on
Brrt brrt, nigga we made it




[Verse: Mars TY & Drake]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Hook]
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

[Bridge: Mars TY & Craker Boyyy x2]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby


[Intro]
One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, "What are those?"
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want


[Outro]
Yeah, that's right, yeah



[Intro: Drake & Future]
Wheezy outta here
Ayy

[Verse 1: Drake]
This ain't no regular shit
We never beggin' for shit
Niggas is ready to quit
Shit that they hate to admit
In Texas, I keep a rifle inside of the whip
Call it drivin' a stick
In Vegas, I get two million a night
From the Wynn, just to run through the hits
All that on top of the chips
Cash 'em all out then I dip
Bet on fifteen 'cause of Nip
My pocket get blue like a Crip, ayy
What a slime to be alive
You don't want problems with the guys
She wanna come through just to vibe, well
We got different things in mind, well
London been treatin' me very well
Whole lotta chocolate and caramel
I cannot drive to the hotel
Might end up sleepin' in Annabel's
Summer, all I did was rest
New Year's, all I did was stretch
Valentine's Day, I had sex
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next

[Chorus: Young Thug]
What a time to be a slime, uh
Hit that pussy from behind, huh
What a time to be a slime, uh
Flipped it up and left a lime (Slatt, slatt), uh
What a time to be a slime
Niggas better win then they in prime
What a time to be a slime
Niggas get rich, they say you droppin' dimes

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
This ain't no regular shit
I don't take regular shits
I could go Michael or Prince
Or I could keep the score how it is
I took a trip to the Ritz
I took advantage of the bitch
I told her to feed me some grits
Then I put on some shoes and dipped
If niggas tell you they fuckin' with me
I'ma gon' tell you that's caninini'
Opps say I'm never knowin' where that they be
Bitches be sayin' they always see me
I took two years off and now I'm OD
Rappers just thought it was over for me
Christmas, I bought her the flawless AP
Didn't read the caution and now it's elite
Moshpit, mob shit, monster, rob shit
I go brazy in a mosh pit, pop opp shit, yeah
Mobster, Rastafari
I could [?] garden, lotta weed, follow me, yeah

[Outro: Young Thug]
Sex, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt


[Produced by Nineteen85 and Maya Jane Coles]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ugh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about are talkin' blunt and stayin' blunted
Pretty women are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all just disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You seem to flee to all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rolling and their mood change
Like a muthafucka
New flow, I got a dozen of em
I don't trust you, you're an undercover
I could probably make some stepsisters fuck each other, whew
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What? Tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

[Hook: Mally Mall] x2
Whatcha say huh?
Whatcha say huh?
Whatcha say huh?
Real niggas all day, all day what


[Verse 2: Kid Heat]
Whew, this the king from under
They say to bet against the odds but I like even numbers
The kid, I'm all up at the cribbo, fuckin' on a bad bitch
Ass like a hippo, leavin' bitches crippled
Read the bitch MO, play it like a demo
Trickin' when ya got it really is a n-o
But I'm just really stickin' how I feel right now huh
Niggas can't stand real right now, huh?
Can't see me, invisible
Make ya bitch need the kid, feinin' like it's critical
Rappers try to see me, feelin' so invisible
Niggas wanna be me, bout to get it physical, ain't stoppin'
Clock stop it, pop lock it
Stock option, cock block it, Glock cock it
To take a shot, girl your genitals
Got me goin' in with only 60 minute intervals
You know you bad

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Oh, it's the 8th wonder
Wonder how I keep comin' with the Bay number
Yeah, I play the money, I play it off cause you ain't had a lot
She gon' say I'm cocky, told her "You know that I get that a lot"
Codeine, like a night game
The rave cocaine came with a scale mane
Trynna be the only one, that's a long race
I'll call you Billie Jean, but what would Mike say?
In L.A, in L.A, in L.A (in L.A)
We in the mansion, all day
MIA, all the girls with it
Late night, they say "Don't stop, get it, get it"
8 mil' for the new home
See the gold car, she like Raw home
No shades I'll bring it to ya face nigga
Like whatcha say, whatcha say, nigga


[Hook]

[Intro]
Yes

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm on that old, switch lanes shit, Jay, Big, Dame's shit
Talking 'bout them niggas that my daddy pitch cane wit
Because I never learned the biz, I learned the language
Well-spoken, man I should've went to Cambridge
And mama would always claim this
I never expected the outcome, but one day I became this
Famous, no longer nameless
More game, but I'm the same, I will remain this
I'm still focused, I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read 48 Laws if you never read it
Because that is one of the main reasons I'm level-headed
Despite the accumulated success
If my attitude ever strayed, I made it regress
I never wanted to win the lottery only because my uncle
Told me "He who made it by struggling made it the best"
So with that on my chest, I'm down on my last 12 gs
Going through the closet thinking I should prolly sell these
Chanel Cs, and LVs, somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all, who needs anymore?
Whose satisfied doin' good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore, who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me, that should have my whole race shook
Because we don't read novels but we do FaceBook
The new craze is havin' that new age look
If I said I liked it, I'd feel like a two-faced crook
Nah, I tell retro kids tie that bandana just a little bit tighter
'Til it suffocates you, biter
Cause I don't wear no bright colors or rope chains
I'm a G, my daddy was in the dope game



[Refrain: Rihanna & Drake]
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name? (Uh)
What's my name? What's my name? (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah, you know, word of mouth
The square root of sixty-nine is eight somethin', right?
'Cause I've been tryna work it out, oh
Good weed, white wine, uh
I come alive in the night time, yeah
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Let it play
Say you gotta leave, but I know you wanna stay
You just waitin' on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes, girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's gettin' hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go, the text that I write is gon' say

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?
What's my name? What's my name?

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Not everybody
Knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
But, boy, you stay up on it
You got that somethin'
That keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge
Let's explore your talent

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Lookin' for a guy to put in work
Oh woah, oh woah
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Lookin' for a guy to put in work
Oh woah, oh woah

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?
What's my name? What's my name?

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
Baby, you got me
And ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth, you rock me, yeah
So I surrender
To every word you whisper
Every door you enter
I will let you in

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Lookin' for a guy to put in work
Oh woah, oh woah

[Bridge: Rihanna]
You're so amazing
You took the time to figure me out
That's why you take me
Way past the point of turnin' me on
You 'bout to break me
I swear you got me losin' my mind

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?

Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Lookin' for a guy to put in work
Oh woah, oh woah




[Introduction: What's the 411 PT. I,  Produced by Amir Royale]

[Acapella Intro]

[Refrain]
Feel the moment
But think what you've forgotten
God and gotten rotten (got it!)
Just remembered a thought or two about it
('Bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it)
You ain't 'bout it
If only you'd allow it (to grow)
Louder, scream it louder
I can't hear you! Louder!

[Verse 1]
I hate crowded rooms, I'm a little claustrophobic
That's why I let my feelings out it in the open
I don't like to hold them in
Hate how it's been an hour
I'm an hour clerk, I just count the time fly by
While I'm sitting in my math class
Man I hate class, but I still have it
Ain't that ironic?

[Interlude: The Ride, Produced by Drew Williams]

[Segue]
Girl, I got it going on, I got it going on
What's the 411? What's the 411?
I got it going on, I got it going on
What's the 411? What's the 411?
Girl, I got it going on, I got it going on
What's the 411? What's the 411 hun?

[Verse 2]
You won't feel me 'til everybody say they love you
But it's not love, bring it down an octave
Cause you're just another kid that the crew can get rid of
They say be quiet and stay silent
But you just staying loud, keeping proud
Cause you were taught that they were born to listen
And that you were born to fix up all the broken niggas
Bitching on the second level
Who are you to try? These niggas lost their lives?
Well, I just thought I'd offer one
You won't feel me till one of your ex girls gets knocked up
She says she took a step but he took it further
Thinks he ain't mean to hurt her, she says shes certain
But now its been a month, so now she has her doubts
Yeah she has her doubts and you have your doubts
Cause you warned her bout the route she's taking
See you always have advice, so you always giving
But they don't ever listen, they just pat you on your back
And say they "feel you", nigga

[Break]
I've been fading too long
I've been fading too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride

[Verse 3]
You won't feel me 'til you're at your mother's funeral
And you're the only one not crying
Cause you can't get it through your head that she passed on
Yeah, she's really gone, no, she's really gone
But you just don't believe it, you think they got it wrong
You won't know me till your friends
Start laughing at you like some damn Hyenas
Reminds you of Selena back in eighth grade
When she said that, "You're doing wrong,"
That, "You need to change"
"Life is not a fairy tale, it ain't no fucking game."
You're gonna hate me, I swear, you're gonna hate me
When you catch kids sipping Pinnacle during missionary
Meanwhile, you bringing dead energy to a cemetary
Searching for your mother's grave
Crying yourself to sleep at night, cause you ain't got it right
You ain't even write a letter to say bye or nothing like
Your Dad fucking hates you, Mama's outta songs
Grandpa pays the bills and you always feel alone
So, "What's good at home? What's good at home?"
If you keep on X and O'ing, keep on telling lies cuz
"I feel you", nigga, I feel you

[Interlude]
"What's good at home? What's good at home?"
If you keep on X and O'ing, keep on telling lies cuz
"I feel you", nigga, I feel you
Yeah, yeah—I feel you
Yeah, yeah—I feel you
Yeah, yeah—I feel you

[Conclusion: What's the 411 PT. II, Produced by Amir Royale]

Louder, scream it louder

Been an hour, I'm an hour clerk

Sitting in my math class, man I hate class

In the ‘rari doing donuts like my name was J Dilla
All about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer
Keep the work up in the attic and the money in the cellar

Ain't another brother realer, blowin' thousand dollar killa
With that Filipino flow that I just got in from Manila
'Bout to snow up in my city so let me put on my chinchilla
In the 'Rari doing donuts like my name was J Dilla (Dilla)
All about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer
Keep the work up in the attic and the money in the cellar (Cellar)
Your girl up in the second, automatics for the fellas (Fellas)
You see us in the back then all you gotta do is tell us

[Chorus: Drake]
What up? What up?
H-Town in this bitch
What up? What up?
H-Town in this bitch
What up? What up?
H-Town in this bitch
What up? What up?
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city




[Intro]
Yeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
"Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"
(June, you're a genius)
I said, "I respect it, no problem"
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real

[Verse]
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn, coach, put him in"
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah

[Outro]
For real
Facts, you know what I'm sayin'?
Hahaha, yeah


SO when a girl poop on kriz, it smells like rice
I love spice, like my guyz
Like my hoes theyre so nice
Like my mom they be fly as a kite

U wanna go, with my flow
No one know, where they boutta go
I eat a sandwich, i touch my nose
I eat an elastik, i touch my toes

Ur girl really hot, mines kinda not
Maybe if i fart, on a big ass tart
Wanna go to America, eat a hambuga
Cause i love me some poop

[Intro: Drake talking]
Okay...
There comes a time...
When you gotta be like
You know, I've come this far on my own, done a lot for myself
Where to now, you know?
But I just—I just tell myself this one thing

[Verse: Drake]
It was worth it, it was all worth it
And by this time, I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit, but they served they purpose
And I got verses, I got verses
My sixteens should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah, Heartbreak Drake, I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse, then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come overnight
Go—Go—Go—Goddamn, how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over, watch a season of Flight of the Conchords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But ugh, tell me you surfing, let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes, I swear to God, girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Fords
Ethiopian girl, Ethiopian girl
With your long, curly hair and yo' big ass boo-tay
Reading all them pro-Black, pro-female books
Just let 'em, let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription, a vision correction
I'm young and successful, I'm living perfection
And man, if '09 is when I'ma see mine
Being cool ain't enough, homie; I'ma freeze time, like that!



[Verse 1: Drake]
I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can’t believe we’re finished
My life is movin’ fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can’t put this behind me
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could’ve had my all by now, by now
It’s been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you

[Verse 2: Dawn Richard & Drake]
I swear I heard you call
But when I heard you'd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
I'm steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keeps looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
That's why I'm asking this question

[Chorus: Colin Munroe & Drake]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (Uh)

[Verse 3: Drake]
I can't go to bed
I'm thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a U-Haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We we're on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you


[Verse 1: Drake]
Took if from signing my own yearbook to booked for the year
Got a condo and I couldn’t even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to TSX
To people wondering if its the Phantom he gets next
Who knows, its the rabbit its buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin he’s feeling
Its kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasn’t really around when it wasn’t appealing
Now its denim diamonds an perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in
(I love the line about the range with the rims to match)
What girl that wasn’t me who’s verse you saying
Shit I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other niggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I don’t forget the past
And you gave me nothing so I’m gonna give you nothing right back, like…

[Chorus: Drake & Colin Munroe]
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…


[Verse 2: Drake]
Young, dumb, looking in the mirror
Trying to figure out who Im gonna be this year
Its funny you managed to be around for the present
All puns intended your funds are mended
If I take back the cheddar it'll better for both us
No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a call from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this ain't hollywood squares to me
Sweetie I’m far from a hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if its not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasn’t in it, fine
But try to get a start at the finish line
Ah

[Chorus: Drake & Colin Munroe]
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…

[Intro: Future]
I don't wanna hear all that, I don't wanna hear none of that
Talkin' commas, how much you need and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 2: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion


[Verse 3: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was "what's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 4: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up


[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Outro: Future]
Where you ass was at, when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Verse 1: YG]
I'm that nigga with the plugs
I'm the nigga who got homies that be sellin' drugs
I'm the nigga on the back street
With the fat heat, niggas better run like athletes
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
My Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block
Police pull up, I'm tryna stash the Glock
You that nigga on the low-low
You're the nigga, you're the one that be talkin' to the po-pos
Porsche sittin' on Forgi's
Niggas can't afford these
The Panamera shittin' on the 9-11
I call my homies, not 911
I'm the nigga with the juice
But I'll never do my nigga like Pac did Q

[Chorus: YG]
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Champagne
Bitch, who do you love?
I got a shorty name Texas Syn
She got a buddy named Young JB and now you know the deal
We turnt up in the studio late night
That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you
If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young Money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
I'ma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big
Wassup


[Chorus: YG]
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

[Bridge: YG]
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block
With the fat heat; run like athletes
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block

[Chorus: YG]
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

[Outro]
Nigga we straight and we hood
Ain't nobody ever gave us shit
When you see us shinin' it's because we steady grindin'
We stay paper chasin'
Separatin' the real from the fake
The fake from the real
We livin' to die and dyin' to live!
Nigga, that's why we got so many women
I'm tryna go deep, hit them asscheeks
Bust them guts, make her cum
Bitch, you know the game!
Ain't a motherfuckin' thing change!
Bitch! Who do you love!?


[Skit: YG]
Ay, hold up!
I done lost too many homies in these past couple years. This shit brazy!

Yeah, in every song I said this shit

I'm a 4Hunnid nigga, I don't care at all

I ain't really into giving more than one chance girl
I already tried with alot of these niggas, fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that? That can't be from here
That can't be what they believing is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit, that's that fake shit
That's that top row of veneers
Just when they getting impatient is when I make a world premiere
Uh, damn, word?
Award shows coming? Make sure you spell that shit right
Make sure to give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff still in that Sprite
They watch us make the shit into the song
You ain't livin' that boy, stop stealin' that life
Anything can happen when I do see ya

Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right

[Verse: Yukimi Nagano]
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rushing the night like a shark, babe, would it be bad?
If I had to set the alarm 'cause of the thrills that run up my back
You are my star, nothing else can lead me off track

[Chorus: Yukimi Nagano & SBTRKT]
Hey-yeah, you're like a wildfire
You got me rising high
Your innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime, if you don't
You'll expire by the throat

[Verse: Yukimi Nagano]
I could bet all the riches that I ever had
Rushing the night like a shark, babe, would it be bad?

[Chorus: Yukimi Nagano & SBTRKT]
Hey-yeah, you're like a wildfire
You got me rising high
Your innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime, if you don't
You'll expire by the throat
Your innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime, if you don't
You'll expire by the throat
Hey-yeah, you're like a wildfire
You got me rising high
Your innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime, if you don't
You'll expire by the throat
Your innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime, if you don't
You'll expire by the throat

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'ma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

[Chorus: Drake]
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I say damn I must be left
'Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

[Chorus: Drake]
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you


[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Now she don't know about me but I'ma put her on it
And she ain't sure about me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

[Chorus: Drake]
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

[Bridge: Drake]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight


[Chorus: Drake]
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the M.I.A
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Drake]
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you


[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Jeremih]
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, I'm with you

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Tell 'em again, tell 'em off (Tell 'em off)
It just dawned on me (On me), what's right, feels wrong
No, no wingman, that's only my A-game
At this game, two can play
Kill your vibe, they don't have the right
Baby don't fight it, you're giving me life
Take your time, set the mood right
Settle down, skeptical at first but now I'm not

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, saving my time for you
Suddenly I freed up (Free)
Freezing my times with you
When I'm lonely, I can bring them up
Closed off my line for you (Closing down my line)
I'm better when I'm just on my own, girl
Standing in line for you (Standing in line for you)
Standing here for I don't know how long, girl
Things I wrote (Ayy), lengths I go
Lets you know that I want you
Words we spoke (Yeah), things you wrote
Let me know that you want me too (Yeah)
Ikebe, pressing on me heavy
Pressing up against me real close
Bakasi, moving on me wassy
Time is moving real slow

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)

I- I- I know you want it, want it
You know I got it, got it
I like your body language girl let's go and talk it, talk it
But you cannot be bothered
When my nonsense is constant
Different day, a different city
I can't stop it I'm on it
Maybe we should start over
Go and start a new chapter
'Cause no mother wants to see her daughter marry a rapper
But would you rather
Be out here with someone like me?
Or be with someone who can take you countries you never seen?
Places you never been, houses you've only dreamed
I know it ain't about the money but I want you to be
Living life problem free
Living life like a queen
But in the end money win no love, ain't what it seems

Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...

[Verse 1]
Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see am I finished

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior


[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior


[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

[Outro]
Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior



[Verse 1: Drake]

(Uh,Yeah, alright, Uh well alright, yeah Well alright uh-huh, yeah "Feel good")

It's a celebration clap, clap BRAVO !
Lobster & shrimp & a Glass of Mescado
For the girl who's a student & her friend who's a model finish the whole bottle
& we gonna do it big like this... Yeah & he was just practice he ain't in your world you could take him of your atlas. Girl your on fire, Can I be the one you match with ? i'll give you a credit card & Baby you could max this OUT ! Show me were your tats is, show me were your hands at maybe I could grasp it. They say if you get her you could understand her better, & she known to be a Cheater but that's only if you let her. Yeah & I got it together, So when they talk & try to Detour me it's like whatever. Tell 'em I appreciate the help. But I just got to know for myself

[Hook: Uness]

Would you love me, if I didn't sing any songs ? if I couldn't take you home ? Would you love me, if I couldn't buy you things ? shoes & diamond rings ? Would you love me if I spent my life, with the same old 9 to 5 ? Would you love me, if I couldn't give it all to you ? Would you love me if I didn't say, Baby you look fly today ? Would you love me if we can't Break away, Take you on a Holiday (yeah) ? Would you love me, if I Said things I don't mean ? would you leave or Stay ? Would you lovee me ? I say maybe. If it goes wrong would you just leave me ? Now would you lovee me ? I say maybe, if it goes wrong, would you stay or would you go ? would you love me ?

[Verse 2: Drake]

This life style is vile, The shit will damage ya, Especially when you think No ones understandin' ya. these girls prove with their over protective Managers, Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin' their cameras. Snap, snap, snap til there running out of card space, you remind me of Tony's sister on Scarface just take it easy on love and slow your heart rate. Goodness gracious, the top is just a hard place. Yeeah but if you never even been there, it kinda make sense' why you diein' to pretend there. Spillin' all your drinks, takin' pictures in your swim-wear. Head up in the clouds, you surviing on thin air. (would you love me) I know that shit is exhaustin' girl, and your mistakes are Costin' girl, and maybe ll dont need the help but I just gotta see for myself...

[Hook 2: Uness]x2

Girl would you loveee me I say maybe, If it goes wrong would you just leve me ? now would you love mee ? I say maybe, If it goes wrong would you stay, or would you go ?...

[Outro: Uness]

Baby everybody love a Summer day. But can you trade the sun for just a Rainy day ? in the Darkest hour would love find its way ?

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure (yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her
Not only could I do better, but I know better
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?
Feelin' like Rae, same damn 'Lo sweater
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, Moetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Ain't nothin' like a bad bitch
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw
Like Bruh Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, "It's yours"
I know this shit is mine for the takin'
If I ain't in Mason it's some gay shit
Prolly why I don't react when you say shit
Half the times niggas don't even make sense
Know this shit is yours
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit
You know this shit is yours
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit
You know this shit is yours
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance
I took a little moment out to say this


[Hook: Drake]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge: Drake]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man


[Hook: Drake]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure



[Intro]
Don't want no motherfucking niggas on my dick bitch
Yea..

[Verse]
I just love when I'm with you
Yea this shit's on ten
We used to be friends girl
And even back then you would look at me
With no hesitation and you'd tell me baby

[Chorus]
It's yours
It's yours
It's yours
That's for sure
That's for sure
Yea...

[Verse]
How you feel about the game girl?
And how a nigga came through on a new thing
Young nigga switch it up with the Wu-Tang
Now you turn around & look at me
And tell me baby

[Chorus]
It's yours
It's yours
That's for sure
That's for sure
How you feel about!

[Outro]
EHHHH

4 more years until we start diving Ya.bish



More Coming Soon!!! 12/8/12

[Verse 1: Drake]
Listen, girl
You so bad and you single, what's this I hear?
We ain't met yet, my name Drake
And I'ma take the world over, this my year
This I swear
Had my share of women that I been with
I'm young, can ya blame me?
I know you feel like a lot of things off-limits
At least let me describe what it can be
Be faithful, I'll do that
Nah, really, baby girl, I'll do that
'Cause everybody break up when they cake up
We can be the couple that'll never go through that
Yeah and if we ever fallin' off
I swear I'll remind you that
That we're not who they are
Now all I really gotta do is find you
Where you at?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
From the east to the west
Scream for me if you my number one lady
Take a lead from the rest
You can go fast, speed it up for me, baby
I'm a G, what's next
One night with me would drive you crazy
One night with me would drive you crazy
When it starts, are you ready?
Take your marks and get steady
You know that it's about to get heavy
But she's a rider, a rider, my yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, be my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my


[Verse 2: Drake]
Tell me how to locate you
I know satellites all breakthrough
But they don't ever lead me straight to
And I gotta arrive 'fore somebody take you
Know there's someone you don't mean a lot to
And he would hate to know that I got you
I even got a speech in my head
That I write and recite at the moment I spot you
"Hey there, your name is?
I like that, it suits ya
I'm young, but different
I'm not what you're used to at all"
If we stop at the same red light
I'ma celebrate the fact that I found you, girl
And I'ma ride for you too, as soon as it turn green
Wanna hear from my ladies all around the world
Where you at?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
From the east to the west
Scream for me if you my number one lady
Take a lead from the rest
You can go fast, speed it up for me, baby
I'm a G, what's next
One night with me would drive you crazy
One night with me would drive you crazy
When it starts, are you ready?
Take your marks and get steady
You know that it's about to get heavy
But she's a rider, a rider, my yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, be my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my

Cheers to the freaking weekend
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Oh, let the Jameson sink in
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Don’t let the bastards get you down
Turn it around with another round
There’s a party at the bar
Everybody put your glasses up, and I drink to that
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
I drink to that



[Intro: Drake & Future]
Yeah
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch, I'm the baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus, shouldn't have been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, gave my trust
Gave everything, you think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different, make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here tryna keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone, I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head, vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

[Verse 1: Diddy, Chris Brown & Both]
Uh, give my all, you take it from me (From me, girl)
And don't even replace it for me (No)
I wish you'd just fake it for me (Fake it)
I wish I can make you love me more
You can't tell I fucks with you, I needed you
I thought that you understood that based on how I treated you
I don't pay attention to the rumors that you feed into
Know you're missin' somethin', I wish I was what completed you
(Damn, da-da-damn, damn) Damn

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus, shouldn't have been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, gave my trust
Gave everything, you think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different, make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here tryna keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone, I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head, vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

[Verse 2: Diddy, Chris Brown & Both]
Uh, I feel like a killer hit me (Hit me)
The weapon was concealed initially (Oh, oh)
But I felt so much pain from it (Pain)
You deserved to feel it with me more
I feel like I beg with you, I plead with you
I don't comprehend how you can't love when it's so easy to
I thought you could do it, I believed in the naive in you (Oh, oh)
I just need to breathe, baby (Oh, no) now I got the freedom to

[Outro: Chris Brown]
She's like a drug, yeah
And I don't think I can get rid of her (I can't get rid of her)
'Cause she got me in this curse (Yeah)
And then it dawned on me
I can't do nothing with her (Yeah, yeah)
This woman's worth (No, oh)
I can't find my way out and it hurts (Yeah)
I tried but she won't let me go (she won't let me go)
She won’t let me go (she won't let me go, oh)
She won't let me go
She won't let me go
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Woah, oh, yeah, yeah




[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare, myself, myself

[Verse 1]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh

I done died and lived again on DMT, huh
See, this a type of high that won't come down
This the type of high that get you gunned down
Yeezy, Yeezy trollin' OD, huh

Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too
I'ma pray for him 'cause he got MeToo'd
Thinkin' what if that happened to me too
Then I'm on E! News

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself

[Verse 2]
Ayy, hospital band a hundred bands, fuck a watch
Hundred grand'll make your best friends turn to opps
I hear y'all bringin' my name up a lot
Guess I just turned the clout game up a notch
See, y'all really shocked, but I'm really not
You know how many girls I took to the titty shop?
If she get the ass with it, that's a 50 pop
I still bring the bad bitches in the city out
Uh, just a different type of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke with Wiz Khalifa, uh
Told my wife I've never seen her
After I hit it, bye Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it up

[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See, this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye!
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout!
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds, ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Ask your homegirl right now, "Look, you had a shot at Ye?"
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
You'd drop everything!

[Verse 3]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
This is why your bitches fuck with me, huh
Smash, she gon' end up on TV, huh
Last thing that you ever wanna see, huh
I can feel the spirits all around me
I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me
They know I got demons all on me
Devil been tryna make an army
They been strategizin' to harm me
They don't know they dealin' with a zombie
Niggas been tryna test my Gandhi
Just because I'm dressed like Abercrombie

[Outro]
You see? You see?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
That's why I fuck with Ye!
See, that's my third per-
That's my bipolar shit, nigga, what?
That's my superpower, nigga, ain't no disability
I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!
Agghhh!

You just wanna live a nigga life
Sittin' in a helicopter, I can touch the sky
Fuck them hoes
Just fuck them hoes



[Verse 1: Promise]
I Promise, I try College
Did it but I quit it they couldn't define knowledge
For me, I got it, So I’m honest
He living, Spitting Wisdom with some of the top artists
Who are not flawless, but my part is
Yet they don't see what I'm doing is not (?)
They like, Promise, why bother
Well living in the sewer, it’s filled up with hot garbage

[Hook: Promise]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

[Verse 2: Drake]
If this don't sell, Imma make it sell
And criticism's invited, I take it well
My savings account got a vacant smell
And priorities shift when you take a L
Every time I feel like leaving
Somebody'll play Comeback Season
And that'll give me enough of a reason
To stand outside trying to jingle my keys and
I guess I'm attached to her
Can't fathom going back to a bachelor
When you've been in a Range since you started high school
It’s hard going back to the Acura
Yeah, yeah
So Imma stick around as the rain trickle down and the cars get sold
These rappers is all thickle but a ways it could sound
Full of loud and go and put her face to the town

[Hook: Promise & Drake]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

[Verse 3: Sacario]
You got me
And you got me
And you got me
When I said I’m not a rapper it's not cause I am
It’s cause my momma said I'm not like them
I don't look like them
I don't act like them
Only way you know I rap is if you see me rappin’
And I am the truth I can't lie
Hand on the bible in the booth with punch lines
And New York City dumb high
Too much champagne
Threw it up like gang signs
You wanna know if you got me?
Then watch me
But watch me through a train, I
Cause I am Sacario
The same guy
Who flow like
Flow like agua
We don't like no fake, nada
Rappin' ass actor,you need an Oscar
And the world know who I are
Why you think Promise featured a pop star?
Sacario

[Hook: Promise]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me


[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Verse 1]
Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in ’02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted 'til I'm out it
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck

[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know


[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Verse 2]
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin' to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn’t what your motive is


[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Hook 1]
(If I ever)
Yeah, if I ever made you angry
Girl, just know that it gets better with time (Time)

They say time heals
She said my name when they fucked
I’m on her mind still
He won’t say it but I bet he knows you’re mine still

That nigga insecure it got you angry
Lately you’ve been noticing he ain’t me
(It’s 3AM)
That’s what you get for tryna change me
Girl, can’t no nigga replace me
I’m always gonna be the same me

They time heals
Don’t tattoo no niggas name because you’re mine still

Ain’t going nowhere until you make me

[Verse 1]
That lets me know that I’m staying
You made your bed, so this the bed that you lay in
You call your girls to get opinions, just to see where they weigh in
They tell you leave me be you do everything but what they’re saying


What was the point in asking
If you ask me, you’re doing everything backwards
Won’t lie, it’s difficult to forget all that happened
First step for that is embracing all that has passed us
It throws me off that you told him about the past us

I was sitting at the bar when I saw you with a nigga I ain’t know
But I seen his face around
I ain’t think much into it then but it hit me now
Ain’t that ol’ dude you told me not to worry about
I ain’t got a read yo body language, baby girl cause I can hear it shout
He don’t give you pleasure, you miss having me around

[Hook 2]
Since he can’t put it down like me she angry
I even think he noticin’ he ain’t me
(He ain’t, no he ain’t)
That’s what you get. You can’t erase me
Girl, can’t no nigga replace
You know now and it’s hard to face it

They say time heals
You tell him that pussy’s his, you know it’s mine still

Girl, you can lie to him but you can’t play me
Why else have you texted me lately


[Verse 2]
I told you that the grass ain’t always greener then said “pick a side”
You can try to hide but you can’t run from what you feel inside
Probably typed a message for me just to get your feelings out
Read it then deleted it but it’s probably still memorized

Damn, I know you so well
You say you OK but your face says what’s real

[Hook 3]
Yeah, can tell you feel a way, I see you angry
Everybody noticed that he ain’t me
(Yeah) (he ain’t)
That’s what you get. I hate to say it
Girl, can’t no nigga replace me
You lie to yourself saying you hate me
But we both know that’s false

They say time heals
Don’t say yes if he proposes cause (you’re mine still)

But regardless of it all, you’re still my baby

[Outro]
(regardless of it all, you’re still my baby)



[Intro: Yung Bleu]
If I ever

[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
If I ever made you angry, girl
Just know that it get better with time (Time)
They say time heals
She can't see her life without me, she's so blind still
Fuck that nigga, you can tell him that you're mines still

[Pre-Chorus: Yung Bleu]
And she don't wanna go to sleep, she angry
Lately, she's been noticing he ain't me

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I wish that we can change places
Don't want no new, new faces
She got my heartbeat racing
They say time heals
Don't go build no life without me 'cause you're mines still
Oh, and I don't wanna go unless you make me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Pretty face, pretty tempted
But pretty taught me ugly lessons
Pretty had me givin' more than I was gettin'
So if pretty don't come with somethin', well, then I dead it
Ashamed to tell my friends how much I'd do for you
'Cause they know that you would never do the same for me
I wasn't lookin' for your secrets, they just came to me
And they contradicted everything you claimed to be
I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know
And I know them type of hugs
Same shit I do to women when I know I used to fuck
And I know they with they nigga, but they never brought it up
I'm down these days
Down to do better 'cause you know I done enough
You should lay it down, we'll talk about it when you up

[Pre-Chorus: Yung Bleu & Drake]
But she don't wanna go to sleep, she angry
Lately, she's been noticin' he ain't me
(He ain't me)
(Yeah)

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I wish that we can change places
Don't want no new, new faces
She got my heartbeat racing
They say time heals
Don't go build no life without me 'cause you're mines still
And I don't wanna go unless you make me

[Verse 3: Yung Bleu]
Down on my knees, hopin' you take me
Better tell that nigga you mine
Heard you've been trying to tie the knot, girl, tell me you lyin'
Let me beat that pussy up one more time
Let me beat that pussy up one more time
I know that you fiend for this
I know that you did not forget
So don't go to sleep

[Pre-Chorus: Yung Bleu]
And she don't wanna go to sleep, she angry
Lately, she's been noticing he ain't me
(Oh, he ain't me)

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I wish that we can change places
Don't want no new, new faces
She got my heartbeat racing (Hey, yeah)
They say time heals (They say)
Don't go build no life without me 'cause you're mines still
Oh, and I don't wanna go unless you make me

[Outro: Yung Bleu]
Lately, I've been gone, I'm feelin' crazy, yeah

[Intro]
Rider shit

[Verse 1]
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who"
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who," yeah
And she like, "Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice

[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah
Hard labor let me pay the price

[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Look...I know im in love with ladies and know that ladies love YouTube
Too much views on a billboard and time is wasting with stalling
All of this cash ain't for me, I've been saving for us
Times get harder and harder each time for new videos
Wanna show our love to the world and expose my emotions
Guess i'm nervous just to tell you, don't want you to be embarrassed
If I waste more time my feelings will get deep and shady
My shadow will turn green and others would think imma freak
Guess that what happens when you've done too much in Lovers Creek

[Zane Lowe + Drake]
Alright, this is it right? We are rolling and we're recording, let's begin. This is a very special broadcast of OVO Sound Radio right here, Beats 1, Apple Music.  Long time coming man.  Long time coming man...long time coming, an exciting time, an exciting night for obvious reasons. Any way, man, here we are in the Safe House this is kind of...I suppose the official home of OVO Sound, this is the heart now of OVO Sound, here in Toronto, OVO house based in Toronto. Uhm...It's 40's spot, where the music gets made.

40's...uh  what do they call it, like a brain child, brain child? This is 40's creation from the ground up...I mean I was here, man, when there were no walls. I was here when there was no...not even a hint of a studio, or any...and uhm, he saw it through to the end. I mean, incredible execution on a vision that he had from the very...very early on. I know he's always...he's always enjoyed living in the same space that he works in. So he's been able to build this...build this complex that we utilize to get the job done, yeah.

When you walked in here for this first time, because I always thinking like....rooms you can catch a vibe pretty quick Yeah  And you know 40 obviously build this, you were there for the process...and when, you know, he called you in for the first session...did you, did you catch a vibe? Did you record something that first night?

I was here, uhm, I was here a few times as you know...I was here when this room first started functioning and everything else wasn't built. I think....I think maybe the first...one of the first things we did here that got released was probably "Back to Back" ironically enough, but I think that was kinda when we were kind of....That's how you, uh, that's how you broke the bottle on the bow? Haha that was like one of the first...  On that track? That was like one of the first thingsWow.  that we actually recorded and it...and it...Tangible energy from the get-go.

I mean, you know, just...  Get it done. execution, man, just following suit. I watched 40 execute so I had to come in here and execute too, that's it.  How many visitors really...I mean I know there's a lot of people in here tonight for obvious reasons, because, you know, we're tryna capture something. You know...but, uhm, you know, when it's, when it's... business time, how many...how many visitors generally roll through here? Cause the vibe I get is you guys keep it pretty...pretty light.

Yeah, I don't really. I'm not really into, like, a whole bunch of people and distraction, uhm...I have, you know, I have respect for everybody and their craft in whatever they do. So I expect the same thing when people come in here, I don't want a bunch of hustle and bustle, talking and...loud you know. And...and the other thing that's tough when you invite people in the studio...is they're obviously coming to watch something happen. Right.

And...and it doesn't always happen every night.  You know...it's not like every night is some magic moment. I mean, there's nights of frustration, there's nights of nothingness, there's night of just...you know, uh...these little tactical, uh, things. That clinical, surgical edits and stuff that...it gets you know Housekeeping. Right. I pretty much gauge the, uhm... characters that are allowed to sit in here based off of how they conduct themselves on those type of nights.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And I think I have a pretty immediate, immediate team that is able to sit in here and I...I...I...I don't want to notice you, and that's not to be offensive,  I just don't want to know that you're here. I want to be able to...to get up and just go in there and spill you know. Not worry about people's feelings Yeah. or tensions or any of that, that makes perfect sense, you know. Today unless...you change your mind Laughing  the album's done It's done. 40 sent it while the game was on. It's crazy, I mean we're literally watching the Raptors while 40 was...you know... Mhm.  I think the line was  from Noel was "right now we've been finished for seven seconds." Yeah hahahahaha.

Vincent like came in, he was like "but nah, I sent the...I sent the email seven minutes ago, we've been finished for seven minutes." And he want to his computer and he was like "ah, I never sent it."  The game clock was kinda measuring the album clock too you know, it's synonymous tonight. Oh man the world clock has been measuring the album now...and, and to a certain extent that's your fault. Cause back on August the 6th in 2014 you announced the name of the record. Yeah.

Now...now I have...I spoke to your friend Skepta about announcing records prematurely.  Mhm. And he was pretty straight about it, he wish he hadn't done it. He felt the pressure of announcing Konichiwa way up front, added additional pressure to him. I mean...you did it almost two years before you delivered the record. How did it work for you making that announcement, you know... in 2014?

I think the...the announcement was more than just the album title, it was just a shift in the city. You know, that we, uh...we saw an opening there. You know, it was, it was, the name took on a life of it's own. Uhm...and now the city is obviously referred to as, as what it is...Yeah.  Uhm...and yeah, I mean...I...we're...me and Oliver are always, are very cautious about that. Uh...we never wanna prematurely announce anything, but I kinda feel like, like it's crazy that you say two years cause t really doesn't feel like two years. I mean, yeah, I just had this plan to finish this album and then...but I, I remember I was like "oh man, well you know, I'm gonna do a mixtape."

Just cause I'm just like at this place, where I'm..I'm in this hotel every night, I just wanna make rap music, and I always, always wanted to make a, a project with Boi-1da. Uh...just like, exclusively like his... his brand of music, like just hard ish, like uh...trying to snap as much as I could and get as many joints as I could in, in a short amount of time. Uhm...and so that's kind of, you know, I was really adamant about finishing that mixtape first and then I said, okay then I'll move on. I mean, when we...when we do these albums, and especially if it's me and 40...it's never not been me and 40...but, when me and 40 lock in.  We really lock in  ...yeah.  and we take it very seriously and it's not... it's not like some rush job, you know? We...we, we'll sit there and, and we...like I said some nights we don't even come here and make music some nights we just talk yeah... we talk and we listen and you know, we try and figure out, what...what the direction is and what...what works for me...  It seems to me,  that might be a distinction because you blur the lines so successfully, it helps in the evolution of mixtapes. They've been around in existence for a long time and yet when you started to do and some of your peers started to do it at a similar time, these mixtapes were becoming blockbusters in their own right. They weren't just moving the streets anymore, they were actually moving the sales and the charts and you were touring off the back of these things.


Well, well that was it, I went...I wnt on a full-blown tour off of If You're Reading This It's Too Late....  It's crazy. ...and it went straight to iTunes  and I feel like that's like a...that's a hundred percent a possibility, same thing we do with a lot of the OVO Sound artists, you know, it's like, why not? You put all this time  and they're all original sounds, why should shouldn't it be able to be...you know, I understand, I understand...the...the joy of getting a free body of work from somebody, but you know, this is like one of the only platforms we have left to like generate interest and income and all these, you know, these...get the attention and make it that easy to access... and focus... as opposed to going to ten different places to try and find it once links are being you know...so I mean...  It's focusing your audience, isn't it  ultimately?  Yeah and that's really what it's about right now, is, is...and that's, I mean not to shamelessly plug but even...you know, what we've been doing with Apple Music and stuff like that...it's like you know, just focusing the audience and giving them a place to go and hone in on this one hub to go get everything.

Uhm...but with that being said, you know, I...I finished that tape and I was really happy with it a lot of the songs got bigger than expected and we had to go do some shows... I wondered that...I wondered, you know, if it...I mean I know you dropped it in the early hours in the morning and it was just like "Wake up surprise, here's a Drake record" and everything else, but i know how I felt about that album and millions of other people do as well and that record has become, in many respects, a modern-day classic...and I wondered if that caught you off guard?

Uhm...yeah I definitely...I definitely always just treated it like a mixtape. I...I was never...you know, even the difference between this album and that is like...the...the time we spent on the transitions, the layering of the production, the...the changes...just, just...sonically even, the time that 40 and Gadget put in...uhm, you know...this was just a tape that we did in my hotel room at the end of the day...Laughing so, I mean, it's...it's great that people love it, I mean, I always just looked at it as a bridge to get to where we're...we're at today. And then...and then from that, I mean, I ended up going to Atlanta and sitting with Future for six days and he's just a...  a monster  ...he's a machine, it's crazy, I've never seen anybody with that much of a catalog...like I mean, songs that I still think about to this day that I heard in that studio, that I'm like "when is that coming out?"

Oh, I've seen him...I've seen people loading projects

[Verse 1: Drake]
You ask how many girls I been with in my life
I tell ya, "I stopped keeping count when I was 25"
I ask you the same thing, you tell me, "Seven guys"
But we both know that's a lie
'Cause if we countin' head and if we countin' drunken nights
Then that number that you gave just might be off by eight or nine
But it's still nowhere close to mine
Marcus prolly had to bring me straps like thirty times
He took over like four years ago when Courtnee had resigned
I been talkin' sex with Courtnee since like 2005
We been friends since junior high
Tough to enjoy the company and never cross the line
She's like, "Is it more than a hundred, with everyone combined?"
And I say, "Yeah, that's bein' kind"
At one point or another they all felt like they were mine
I had a lot of backs that I would never talk behind
I'm not really into threesomes, I like one thing at a time
I like when it's you and I
Plus I always feel like if somebody outperforms you
That could jeopardize your pride and I'm not into choosin' sides
Unless you 'bout to sleep and you askin' me what's my side
It's the right at home, but this a hotel so you can decide
Lessons that I learned before hittin' my prime
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
Things you need to hear 'fore we say our goodbyes
Free myself of it all, watch a Scorpio rise
Yeah


[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
You say you wanna know but you don't though
Why you wanna know who I cropped out of photos?
And lately, papi, you been acting tonto
What you think before you, I was only movin' dolo
But I'm honest 'til I die, so I won't lie
And I prolly got some numbers that you won't like
And you're prolly gonna hate it
But I much rather be hated for the truth than for the wrong guy if he ain't done
You can't be this good without some badness
What? You think I fuck this good without some practice?
And if it's LOV and you're my MVP
Then why we talkin' about practice?
Like you want me to lie
Why would I jeopardize my worth, just to value your pride?
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
'Cause then I switch up and I blame it on my Gemini
Might be jealousy, 'cause you just want me tradin' lives
Jealousy, 'cause I can get the girls and get the guys
And if I'm honest, this whole convo's just a waste of time
'Cause legacy should be my focus, not here playin' wife

[Drake]
Alright, well alright
I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture won't do me Justice League in this bitch
I’ma do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you can’t touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario
Coming through ya stereo
Plus my girlfriend booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motha fucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isn’t at my session
Mr Anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like

[Hook]
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE

I’m up too high somebody come get me down down down down
Said I’m up too high somebody get me down down down down


[Drake - Verse 2]
Look, my ex girl said she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
Not me I make your battle ships capsize
Get soaked get wet get baptized
I got the full package a nigga complete
I get bread and eat tracks like lunch meat
Sue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
I’m much more then you fathom he would be
And ain't too many niggas that I’d rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these niggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl

[Hook]
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE
[End]
