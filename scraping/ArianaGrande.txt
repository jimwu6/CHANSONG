Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

What does this even say? It says...
It says "I want it, I got it"
Huh...
This sounds familiar, huh?
Dublin, does that sound familiar?
Do y'all know this song?
Alright, well, we're gonna need y'all to sing it as loud as you can
Are you ready?
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings, sing
(Write what I sing, yeah) Yuh

[Pre-Chorus]
(My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy)
(Make big deposits, my gloss) Is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it, sing

[Chorus]
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it)
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Woo, woo, woo, woo
(You like my hair?) Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I want, yep

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems, what?
(Must not have had enough money to solve 'em)
They say, "Which one?" I say ("Nah, I want all of 'em")
Happiness is the same price as red-bottom, just kidding

[Pre-Chorus]
(My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin')
(The way it shine, I know you've seen it) You've seen it
(I bought a crib just for) Just for (The closet) the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, sing

[Chorus]
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Ooh yeah, yeah
(You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it)
I see it, baby, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
Let's go

[Chorus]
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Oh yeah, yeah
(I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it) Ooh yeah, yeah
(You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it)
I see it, baby, I want, yep



[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & 2 Chainz]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it

You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (This who they waitin' on)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (2 Chainz, yep)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
My ideas are priceless, I know I'm the nicest
I knew you would like this, I must be psychic
I'm from the streets, baby, I'm nothing like them (Tru)
She's sweet in the day, but freaky when night come (Tell 'em)
It's mine, invest it (Uh); I spend it on necklace (Uh)
I got the cash if I don't get credit (Uh)
And I'm well respected so she feel protected
So scratch all the exes (ex), it's next like contestants (Woo)
It's blessings, no stressing, I'm flexing
Got one car parked right in the entrance
Got one car parked right at the exit
See, you didn't expect this, you think like a robot
I put bands in yo face like Botox


[Chorus: Ariana Grande & 2 Chainz]
(Yeah) I want it (Yeah), I got it, I want it, I got it (Uh)
I want it, I got it (Uh), I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
A-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh (a-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh)

[Verse 1]
You went to school to learn, boy
Things you never, never knew before
Mmmhmm, like "I before e, except after C"
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you all about love, boy
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

[Chorus]
A, B, C
easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

[Verse 2]
Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, boy
Your education ain't complete
Te-te-te-teacher's gonna show you how to get an "A" (how to get an "A")
Spell "me" and "you" and add the two
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do

[Chorus]
A, B, C
easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me

[Interlude]
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon boy

[Bridge]
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it shake it, baby
1, 2, 3, baby
A, B, C, baby
Do-re-mi, baby
That's how easy love can be

[Chorus]
A, B, C
easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

[Bridge]
Lemme teach how to sing it out
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, lemme show you what it's all about

[Chorus]
A, B, C
easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

[Outro]
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
Baby, you and me

[Verse 1]
Boy, so what's been on your mind?
For me, it's just you all the time
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I, we'll be alright
'Cause here, we get to take our time
You, you're finer than some wine
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I, we'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So when you're ready, baby

[Chorus]
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, your love"
My, my, my, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, yeah yeah"
'Cause you're what I adore, babe

[Verse 2]
After that
When you catch your breath
You look at me and say
"Love, are you real?"
Just don't pretend you're just a friend, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So when you're ready, baby

[Chorus]
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, your love"
My, my, my, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, yeah, yeah"
'Cause you're what I adore, babe

[Bridge]
Just don't pretend you're just a friend
Don't pretend you're just a friend
Don't pretend (Don't pretend) you're just a friend
Don't pretend you're just a friend, boy

[Chorus]
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, your love"
My, my, my, my, my
And then I'm like, "Oh, yeah, yeah"
'Cause you're what I adore, babe




[Verse 1: Idina Menzel]
every December, we always remember
To celebrate the fella in the suit
We see the promos for reindeer and his glow nose
Believe me, I think Rudolph's nose is cute
Now I'm a fan of Frosty, I go ga-ga for The Grinch
But beneath the hype, are they the type you'd turn to in a pinch?
There's someone more deserving of applause
How 'bout a hand for Mrs. Claus
Mm

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I'm not complaining, I'm sure it's very draining
Pulling off a Christmas eve world tour
My point in this is it's his marvelous missus
Who gets it done the other three-six-four
Who's really checkin' all those lists
And fillin' all them shelves
She's a master multitasker who works faster than the elves
Who keeps the North Pole hot 'til winter thaws
The answer's clear, it's Mrs. Claus, mm

[Verse 3: Idina Menzel, Ariana Grande, and Both]
She reads every Christmas letter
Fills out a Christmas sweater
Better than old Santa any day
She runs the operation
With no appreciation
Send a little Christmas love her way
Oh, oh yeah

[Interlude: Idina Menzel]
She just gets no respect
She works so hard

[Outro: Idina Menzel, Ariana Grande, and Both]
Now I'll sing a fa-la-la
And I'll shout a ho-ho-ho
But I'm bouncin' out this ballad for the gal who runs the show
Join me in this very worthy cause
How 'bout a hand for (Oh, oh, yeah)
Let's make it grand for (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
everybody stand for Mrs. Claus




[Verse 1]
Yeah!
I heard a couple of bad things when you were with me
I used to think it was gossip I shouldn't believe, my bae
And I was going around thinking you were my baby (Oh, yeah)
Boy, you were taking the sugar from every lady (Oh, yeah)

[Pre Chorus]
Oh, it went on and on and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, baby?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it

[Verse 2]
All of my ladies will hit me up saying (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You better open your eyes, girl
Your boy's been playing (You know)
Oh yeah
And even though on the outside, you're looking so tasty (Oooh yeah)
Well baby boy, on the inside you're nothing but shady
Na na na na na na

[Pre Chorus]
Boy, it went on and on and on

Oh, baby

While I was going around thinking you're my baby (oh yeah)
Boy you were takin' the sugar from every lady

[Refrain]
Boy it went on, and on, and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long (whoa, my babe)

Yeah, it went on for way too long (whoa, my baby)

[Chorus]
It ain't about what you got

Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, babe?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it

[Post-Chorus]
It ain't about what?
(Na na na na na na na na na na)
It's all about what?
(Na na na na na na na na na na)
It ain't about what?
(Na na na na na na na na na na)

[Bridge]
On, and on, and on

[eVAN]
If you stand here behind me
And you call me a man
And you're counting on me to come through
You should know that I'll give you
The best that I can
But we all have a little more homework to do

If you're walking beside me
And you want to be friends
You should know I'm depending on you
So you gotta hang in there
'Til the whole story ends
'Cause we all have a little more homework to do

And I've been looking in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn't chime
But I'm not ready to put down my pencil just yet
There are too many answers that I didn't get
I need a little less pressure
And a little more time

I am trying to follow
I am trying to lead
I am trying to find what is true
But if you're gonna stand with me
Then you have to concede
That we all have a little more homework to do

[CHARLOTTe]

My name is evan Goldman. I live at 24 Plains Drive, Appleton, Indiana. I'm thirteen years old. And I'm just getting started




[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby


[Verse 1]
I feel delirious
Come, let's get out of here
We're so anonymous, but it's all coming clear
We're heading for the sky, and we'll get lost in it
'Cause all I want, all I want, all I want is everything

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will pose if I wanna
And I will vogue like Madonna
I might not dance like M.J., R.I.P
But I will give the best of me

[Chorus]
All I want is everything, yes, everything
Too much is not enough
I'm sick of settling for in between, and I'm not giving up
As long as it feels right, at least we know that we're alive
All I want is everything, yes, everything, yeah, whoa

[Verse 2]
We don't ever stop, let's watch the sun come up
We'll sleep when we're dead 'cause halfway kind of sucks
We're heading for the sky, and we'll get lost in it
'Cause all I want, all I want, all I want is everything


[Pre-Chorus]
And I will pose if I wanna
And I will vogue, like Madonna
I might not dance like M.J., R.I.P
But I will give the best of me

[Chorus]
All I want is everything, yes, everything
Too much is not enough
I'm sick of settling for in between, and I'm not giving up
As long as it feels right, at least we know that we're alive
All I want is everything, yes, everything, yeah, whoa

[Bridge]
Hold onto me, and I'll hold onto you
Don't overthink, what have we got to lose?
It's me and you, me and you, no matter what, oh, oh

[Breakdown]
We're heading for the sky, and we'll get lost in it
'Cause all I want, all I want, all I want is everything

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will pose if I wanna
And I will vogue, like Madonna
I might not dance like M.J., R.I.P
But I will give the best of me


[Chorus]
All I want is everything, yes, everything
Too much is not enough
I'm sick of settling for in between, and I'm not giving up
As long as it feels right, at least we know that we're alive
All I want is everything, yes, everything, yeah, whoa



[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder? (Major Lazer)
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can stay out of the trouble, is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give, the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountaintops

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
All my love

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

[Verse 2: Nathan Sykes]
If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough

Then make a lotta love on a Monday (Ah, ah)
Never need no (No), no one else, babe
'Cause I'll be

[Chorus Ariana Grande]
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you


[Verse 1: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion & Ariana Grande]
Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true (You're too good to be true)
But I get tired of runnin', fuck it
Now, I'm runnin' with you (With you)

[Chorus Ariana Grande]
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom

Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do (Nothin')
That I won't do, switchin' for you

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo

[Verse 4: Megan Thee Stallion]
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask "Whose is it?"
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

[Bridge Ariana Grande]
This some shit that I usually don't do (Yeah)
But for you, I kinda, kinda want to (Mmm)
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too (And I'm down too)
Yeah, I'm down too
Switchin' the positions for you
This some shit that I (Yeah) usually don't do (Don't do)
But for you, I kinda, kinda want to (Mmm)
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too ('Cause you're down for me)

[Chorus: Cardi B & Ariana Grande]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's some wet-ass pussy
Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet-ass pussy, huh
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops (Jumpin', jumpin')
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do

Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
That I won't do, switchin' for you

[Verse 1: Larry Lovestein & Ariana Grande]
I really can't stay, but baby it's cold outside
I got to go away, but baby it's cold outside
This evening has been-, been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice, I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mama will start to worry, beautiful, what's your hurry?
My daddy will be pacing the floor, listen to the fireplace roar
Really I better scurry, beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just half a drink more, put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think, baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like star light
To break this spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say: "No, no, no, sir," mind if I move in a bit closer?
At least I'm going to say I tried, what's the sense of hurting my pride?

[Chorus: Larry Lovestein, Ariana Grande & Both Harmonizing]
I really can't stay, baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Larry Lovestein & Ariana Grande]
I simply must go, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been-, how lovely that you dropped in
So nice and warm, look out the window and see the storm
My sister will be suspicious, gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, gosh, your lips look delicious
Maybe just a cigarette more, never such a blizzard before
Gotta get home, but baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat, get on your knees right there
You've really been grand, I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see, how can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow, think of my life long sorrow
At least there'll be plenty implied, if you caught pneumonia and died


[Chorus: Larry Lovestein, Ariana Grande & Both Harmonizing]
I really can't stay, baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
I like that one

[Intro]
Baby loves, I'm tryna to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
Think I'd rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just for now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's lookin' at it too
And I don't know what to do



[Intro]

Baby, I've been feedin' the addiction
Flyin' from there and back, felt like an acrobat
Brown eyed, so I fell into submission
Needed to catch myself, like what the hell?

Just to wake you up, wake you up
Push you 'til you break
Now you're steppin' up, steppin' up, ah, ah

Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
Why are you only good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Why are you only?
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Stopped thinking like a victim
This time, I'll throw it back
Boy, can you handle that?
Got you trippin', gave you no attention
That's when I figured out what you're about

I ain't 'bout to stay up on this merry-go-round and round
'Cause we go 'round and 'round
But I don't want no clowns around me (Brrr)

He keep on callin' me "baby"

Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy

[Verse 1]
If you know how to treat me, you know how to touch me
Baby, then you'll get the chance, the chance to love me
It's obvious, I want to be into you
But it all depends on all the things you do
'Cause babe, I promise, I promise
If you keep it real with me, be honest, be honest
You can get anything you want, that you want, babe
Just show me everything I need to see
I'll give you anything, boy

[Chorus]
If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me -


[Verse 2]
I'll give you all of my trust if you don't mess this up
You ain't tryna get no other girls when you in the club
All you got is eyes for me
I'm the only girl you see
So if you treat me right just the way that I want you
Oh, baby boy, I promise that I'll be on you
Oh-oh, on you
Night to the morning

[Chorus]
If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy

[Bridge]
I'll give you all of my trust, if you don't mess this up
You ain't tryna get no other girls when you in the club
All you got is eyes for me
I'm the only one you see

[Chorus]
If you know how to be my lover (Be my)
Maybe you can be my baby (By my side)
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy (Crazy, baby, yeah)
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy



[Verse 1]
I call you up when I know he's at home
I jump out of my skin when he picks up the phone
Why can't I tell if he's looking at me?
Should I give him a smile?
Should I get up and leave?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know it's strange
I don't what I'm thinking
But is it wrong if I see him this weekend?
I really hope I can get him alone
I just don't, don't want her to know

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3
I don't want to, but I want to
'Cause I just can't get him out of my mind and
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
B-F-B! B-F-B!
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother

[Verse 2]
I kinda think that I might be his type
'Cause when you're not around
He's not acting too shy
Sometimes I feel like he might make a move
Is this all in my head?
I don't know what to do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know it's strange
I don't know what he's thinking
But is it wrong if I see him this weekend?
I really hope I can get him alone
I just don't, don't want her to know

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3
I don't want to, but I want to
Cause I just can't get him out of my mind and
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
B-F-B! B-F-B!
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
B-F-B! B-F-B!
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother

[Bridge]
'Cause he's such a dream, yeah
And you know what I mean
If you weren't related

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3
I don't want to, but I want to
'Cause I just can't get him out of my mind and
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
B-F-B! B-F-B!
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
B-F-B! B-F-B!
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother


[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
How soon do we forget how we felt
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we're blind? (Ooh)
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & (Big Sean)]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on (Uh-uh), mm, hold on, eh (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had


[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we're blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, mm, hold on, eh

[Outro: Ariana Grande & Big Sean]
You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
(Best, best, best mistake you ever had)
You, you, you, you
(Best, best, best mistake you ever had)
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you



[Verse 1: Victoria Monet]

Don't you hear the people fighting for their lives?
Baby, there's a war right outside our window
But it's gon' be alright 'long as I got you with me

[Pre-Chorus: Victoria Monet]
In your arms, I find my shelter
Deep in your love, I will hide

And I can hear the children crying while their mothers cry
I'm praying for the people right outside our window
Hoping they find peace at night, just like you and me

In your arms, I find my shelter
Deep in your love, I will hide

Stop the hatred, stop the murders

What kind of life will our babies have if we don't change up and make it last?
It starts right here, starts right now
We'll love and hope for...

[Verse 1]
I told you once, "Get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright"
But some things are better left unsaid
To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna say things like "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe

[Verse 2]
I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid


[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna say things like "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me

Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things

Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up


[Outro]
I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid

[Intro]
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
You keep me in your orbit
Well, I know I'm a hard one to please
Give it too much importance
My love will have you fall to your knees
I tell 'em this too often
Know better than to bark up my tree
Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya


[Verse 2]
Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition
I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

[Outro]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya, uh

[Verse 1]
Sitting in a big white room alone
Tilt my head back, feel the tears fall down
Close my eyes to see in the dark
I feel young, broken, so, so scared
I don't wanna be here anymore
I wanna be somewhere else
Normal and free, like I used to be, oh
But I have to stay in this big white room with little old me

[Chorus]
I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big white room of mine
I'm going crazy, yeah
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big white room of mine

[Verse 2]
Sitting in a big white room alone
Close the door, don't want the pain to come in, no
I clench my fist and try to stay strong
I cry, feel sick
My heart is beating, b-b-beating, beating out of control, yes
Can I run, run faster than you?
I wanna feel my body again
Feel the wind in my hair, yeah
But I have to stay in this big white room, 'cause no one else cares
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, oh


[Chorus]
I'm going crazy, yeah
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big white room of mine
I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big white room of mine

[Bridge]
everybody's looking at me
everybody's staring at me
What do I do now?
Smile, yeah, yeah
everybody's looking at me
everybody's staring at me
What do I do now?
Smile, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big white room of mine
I'm going cra-c-c-c-c-crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big white room of mine
I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big white room of mine

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Ariana Grande]
There is somethin' between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that's something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin' 'til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I can't believe that you are here, I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear?
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Ariana Grande]
There is somethin' between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that's something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin' 'til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Look at you, love, you are the same
You have a light you cannot hide
Yes, you may have a different face
But your soul is the same inside
I don't care who is listening
'Cause they be making fun of this on TV
They wouldn't laugh if they were inside my past life
With you and they were me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go, oh
Never let you, never let you go, yeah
Never let you

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams & Ariana Grande]
Don't think that it cannot happen, 'cause it can
Shawty, you can get blazed
Sleep if you want, and wake up in love again
Shawty, you can get blazed

[Outro: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
(Shawty, you can get blazed)
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you

I know what you looking for, but I'm complete (Yee)
I know what you need, but it won't be me
I know what you want, what you want from me

"Dang, you fine, and look at that face"
At the borderline, beside me, you lay

Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, whoa

It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
(M, M, M, M)
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe."
"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say."

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (born this way)

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (born this way)


Ooh, there ain't no other way

[Intro]
Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not there?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Chorus 2]
express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Refrain]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

[Breakdown]
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are

You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to elevate

[Verse 1]
Some days, things just take
(Way too much of my energy)
(I look up and the whole room's spinning)
You take (My cares away)
I can so over-complicate (People tell me to medicate)

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, oh
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', sing
Breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', oh

Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face


[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'

[Chorus]
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

[Verse 1]
Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

[Chorus]
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you


[Verse 2]
Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

[Chorus]
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

[Verse]
Bright smile that always glows
Pearly whites with a button nose
And I knows, everyone's gonna love me now
Life on a the street  is a nail on the head

It's better than fixing the  roofing instead
The crowd will be packed, and they'll probably sing along
What a girl. What  a nice face, This is my song
I'm the biggest bang with the mostest zing

If you're the hand I'm the diamond ring
By the way, I'm even  the song and the dance
So give me one, give me one
I've already won
All I I need just one chance




Intro:
Celebrity, celebrity

Verse 1:
Coming to the stage is another beauty, so young and talented
Started off as an actress, so full of life and passionate
Never seen one like this, and I can't stop staring
I don't know if it's that attitude or what she wearing

What's up with that
Look at shawty from the back
With a body like that x2
My hearts beating every time I see her, that's for sure
And if we ever got to meet face to face, I'll say to her

Hey I'm a normal man
And you're a beautiful girl
I wish we can get together

You're my celebrity crush
And I love you

I know you're busy on tour a doing concerts
And every time you leave my city, I feel a little hurt
I'm adoring every inch of you, every time I see your face

What's up with that
Lookin' at you from the back
With a body like that x2
My heart is beating every time I see you, that's for sure
With a body like that, and a heart so pure (I'm saying)

[Part 3: 911]

[Verse 1]
Turnin' up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting to manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)

My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one

[Part 4: Rain On Me]

[Intro: Lady Gaga]
Whats up MTV?
Let me change real quick!

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain

Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Lady Gaga]
Rain on me, baby
Rain on me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande & Lady Gaga]
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try, we try
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Lady Gaga]
I can feel it on my skin (It's comin' down on me)
Teardrops on my face (Water like misery)
Let it wash away my sins (It's coming down on me)
Let it wash away, yeah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, & Both]
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me (rain, rain)
Rain on me (rain, rain)
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive, baby
Rain on me, rain, rain

[Part 4: Stupid Love]

[Verse 1]
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me, hee, yee

[Refrain]
I freak out, I freak out, I freak out, look at me
I get down, I get down, I get down, look at me
Freak out, I freak out, look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love, love, hoo

[Speech]
I want your love!
I want it all night! every day!
But I want you to love yourself
Tonight, and every night
Celebrate yourself!
Love who you are!
Be kind, mask up!
Be brave! And braver all the time
1, 2, Make it stupid!

[Chorus]
I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Uh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Now, it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late or
Could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you even if we break in two

[Refrain]
I freak out, freak out, freak out, I freak out (Look at me)
I get down, get down, I get down, I get down (Look at me)
(Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out)
Look at me now

Hey yeah, hey yeah! Oh, I
I, I want (woo!)
We got a stupid love, love, love, love
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse]
If I'm honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
(Just like mine, versions of these belong to you)
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
(Just like me)
They long to be close to you

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson]
Yeah
Hey old friends, let's look back on the crazy clothes we wore
And ain't it fun to look back, and to see its all been done  before
All those nights together, our special memory
And I can't wait for tomorrow
Just as long as you're dancing next to me 'cause

[Pre-Hook 1 : Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson]
It's so clear every year we'll get stronger
What's gone is gone, the past is the past
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas oh

[Hook: Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson]
I know we've come so far, but we've got so far to go oh
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long till it's time to go so
Most day we'll take it fast
And some nights we'll take it slow
I know we've come so far, b-but baby baby
Got so far to go, whoaaah
Oh yeah baby

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson]
Hey old friends together
Side-by-side and year by year
The road was filled with twists and turns, but that's the road that got us here
Let's go past the bad times, but before those memories fade
Let's forgive but not forget and learn from all the mistakes we made 'cause


[Pre-Hook 2]
It's so clear, every year we get stronger (stronger!)
So don't give up, and don't say when
And just get back on the road again 'cause

[Hook: Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson]
I know we've come so far, but we've got so far to go oh
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long till it's time to go so
Most day we'll take it fast
And some nights we'll take it slow
I know we've come so far, b-but baby baby
Got so far to go, whoaaah
Yeah yeah

[Bridge: All]
Hey old friend come along for the ride
There's plenty of room, so jump inside
The highway's rocky every now and then
But it's so much better than where I've been

Just keep movin' at your own speed
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone
We got so far to go!


[Pre-Hook 3]
It's so clear, every year we get stronger (stronger!)
So shine that light
Take my hand and let's dance into the promise land 'cause

[Hook: Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson]
I know we've come so far, but we've got so far to go
I know the road seems long, but it won't be long till it's time to go so
Most day we'll take it fast
And some nights we'll take it slow
I know we've come so far, b-but baby baby
Got so far to go, whoaaah
Oh yeah baby

[Outro: Choir, Ariana Grande & Jennifer Hudson]

[Intro: Kilo Kish, Paige Montgomery, Ariana Grande & Chloe Clancy]
Where are you?
Ohhhhh-ohhh (Hehehe)
Ohhhhh
The Divine Feminine, an album by Mac Miller
Ohhhhh-ohhh
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
Ohhhhh (Hehe)

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Am I supposed to? Okay... love
Love, love, love, love, love (Sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (Sex)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they feel like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl, I'm so in love with you

[Bridge 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Baby), yeah, yeah
Um, well

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, "All you ever think about is sex"
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail"
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right

[Bridge 2: Mac Miller]
Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you

[Outro: Bilal]
You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your lovely ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh

Her tinted globe is a crystal
It's not artificial
But it's beneficial;
Through it she can view you

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Young ambition
Say we'll go slow, but we never do
Premonition
See me spendin' every night with you

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
And I wanna end up on you
Oh, don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just
Dance to this
Dance to this
We can just dance to this

Dear beloved
Bring those 501s a bit closer, bit closer
And dear, my lover
Do that thing we never do sober, sober

Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'

In the face, lookin' at you like "wait!"

Get home late and you don't trust me, baby

You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated

Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude

Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it

Startin' up the engine, need to reboot

And I use every bone in my body
Keep on holdin' on to your trust

But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much, fuck 'em all, let's be us
Summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none

If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'

The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

See what I look like under them lights
We'll keep it quiet, whatever we do

Give you the sweetest kiss that you'll taste
Come unwrap me now, been waiting since midnight

He already made me tired
Making me look like a liar

But tonight, tonight, tonight
I'll get high to get into a fight
I'll show you that I ain't just a bright girl
Tonight I'll stop playing this devil's game
I'll throw all the blame, the names in the flames
In the devil's game

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Devil's game
Oh, oh, oh, oh
The devil's game
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I've been in the spotlight for some time with you, babe
But what good is all this fame and lust
If you always ruin the whole fucking thing
God knows I'm not the same old good girl anymore
I'm trying to play the bad bitch that turned me on
Today will be the last move
And I know you'll miss the way I used turn you on

I'm tired of the same routine
I'm wanting to spill
I'm wanting a change of pace
He already made me tired
Making me look like a liar

Tonight I'll stop playing this devil's game

Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces

You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This lovesick thing
I like serious relationships, and uh...
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cuz everytime a boyfriend and I break-up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me...
And I'm back

[Verse 2]
Oh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this is a lesson
Baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish

[Verse 1]
I dug a single seed into the ground, I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around, you'll see a rose, rose
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere, that you can find me
On a train to Paris going nowhere, draw the bridge behind me

[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long (Too long)
'Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone

Golden leaves are dancing on the ground, it's getting cold, cold (Oh-oh)

All the wonder written on your face, was there inside me


[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long (Too long)

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling with me

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me, suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Are you a mouse or a bear or a..? Um
Whatever you are it's probably the cutest mouse/bear thing I've ever seen
I'm a unicorn if you can't tell
You're the cutest unicorn in the world
That's fine, we can just go to riff on it
Sorry I was fucking up, I was drifting sorry
I was flirting sorry, sorry I was flirting, sorry
Alright everybody, sorry I'll fuck off, here we go, I'm sorry here

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win
Hey now, hey now, don't dream
Hey now, hey now, world, you're an angel Ariana Grande
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now




[Verse 1]
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
They slowly fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

[Verse 2]
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock'n'roll band
Who'll throw it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

[Chorus]
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
Don't look back in anger
I heard you say

[Outro]
At least not today

[Intro]
I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high
It feels like a dream...

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Verse 1]
I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive

I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Verse 2]
In the morning, when I rise
You are the first thing, on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
If feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Bridge]
You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Outro]
You got me feeling high

She's got her own elevation, holy motivation
So I wrote some letters out in big bold type

After laughter comes tears

[Verse 1]
Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I'm sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I'm not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

[Verse 2]
I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin' on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it's shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile

Fuck a fake smile, smile

[Bridge]
If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh
If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh

Such a shame to me to fall for the schemes
I was loving the script, but didn't work the scenes
Half way we walked to end up everything

So dumb, I never could see, what it really was
You trying to play with me, and I never realized

[pre Chorus]
You said you were giving up
That it wasn't working well
Thinking bout you every night and day
Used me just to show and tell

[Chorus]
Somethings gotta give to be happy
And I know it was only killing me
I was dying slowly with this dance
You pretended everything in this false romance

You did our love turn into a movie
Feels like is missing something in me
Lost you to love me, finally
everything in this romance, was false baby (yeah)

Now I don't believe in no one more
You hit me like a bullet to the core
Took me time to close this door
Our love is not something anymore (or maybe in here never existed love)

This is the last dance
I learn to take chances
I'm finally breathing, after drowned in this false romance

So dumb, I never could see, what it really was
You trying to play with me, and I never realized

[pre Chorus]
You said you were giving up
That it wasn't working well
Thinking bout you every night and day
Used me just to show and tell

[Chorus]
Somethings gotta give to be happy
And I know it was only killing me
I was dying slowly with this dance
You pretended everything in this false romance

You did our love turn into a movie
Feels like is missing something in me
Lost you to love me, finally
everything in this romance, was false baby (yeah)

[bridge]
Oh romance, I fell so easily for your plans
It is so hard to live knowing that you'll never be back
But never had something between us it was all pretended
Now just last to us to be happy, we false romantics

Oh romance, I fell so easily for your plans
It is so hard to live knowing that you'll never be back
But never had something between us it was all pretended
Now just last to us to be happy, we false romantics

Somethings gotta give, yeah, yuh
Dying slowly with this dance, baby

I hope you don't take it wrong
You be like, "I'm fallin' back"
But now the cuffing seasons on
Blow now I ain't hit you back
Why you laying home alone?

Stars on the star track
Lap you on the chart for real, uh
And you a customer
Losing

"The first line of 'Focus' is: 'I know what I came to do and that ain't gonna change.' What I came here to do in this world is not only to entertain but to love, to share, to listen, to improve, to learn, to share music, to share experience, to share feelings, to make people feel happy and empowered," she explained.

"To make people feel like they're not alone. Without using my voice to do those things I would feel empty," she continued. "When I say 'focus on me' I'm not asking to be the center of attention. I'm not asking you to focus on my face or my clothes or my body or my singing voice. By 'focus on me,' I literally mean focus on me. Focus on what I'm all about and what I believe in.

"The more we focus on each other as people and not on what we look like, what we're wearing, our gender, our hairstyle, our sexuality, the color of our skin. But focus on each other on a soul level. The more we realize how much we have in common, the more we listen to each other, the more one we become."

The title of Ari's track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her, too, since she's had such a tumultuous year (ahem, remember the donut incident?), but she insists this is about all of us.

"You judge because you don't focus on me, you don't focus on each other," she explained. "You judge because you focus on appearance, on clothes. You focus on what you want from me, what you want from people. How you want them to wear their hair. You judge me, you wanna see me dressed a certain way, how you wanna see their make-up, their eyebrows. You focus on what you think people should be like for you. But when you stop and you actually focus on someone, you'll see the light in them. When you focus on me, you see the light in me. When we focus on each other, we see the light in each other. And even if you don't, this is who we are. What are we making fun of? What's there to make fun of? We should apologize for that."

I'm too much in my head, did you notice?
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
My body's here on earth, but I'm floatin'

Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone

Ain't no time to deny it
So we had to sit down and just write it

[Verse 2]
Want you to get better (Woo!)
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mmm?

(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)

Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we talking about it (Baby)

There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)

How could I ever love you like you're meant to?
How could a view of my skies light your temple?
How beautiful the bird outside my window

Always greener on my other side of things
Think so much of you, I can't overthink
Can't take my eyes off you, I don't wanna blink (No, no)

Never thought something so beautiful could haunt you
Haunt you, haunt you
Better off this way, but I want you
Want you, want you
Sometimes, I just wanna fucking call you
Call you, call you
Never thought something beautiful could haunt you
Haunt you, haunt you

[Verse 2: Mikey]
Must be the summer breeze, the smell of orchids
Or it's the way you look, I won't forget it
Watching the devils dance outside my doorstep
Some kind of heaven I haven't seen yet

Always greener on my other side of things

And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Tryna walk with you, darlin'
Do you hear me?
And no-no-no-no-nobody can stop it
The love you got from me
And every time, I look out at my seat today
They chase, they flash they flash, yes

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Tell me how you feel right now
'Cause all I wanna do is keep it real right now
I'm tryna beat it up, Beat Pills right now
Athletic in the sheets, I got skills right now
Break bread with some red baby hair
Ballin' in the club, Ace of Spades, yeah
Pop that bitch and spray it like 'Raid'
Yellow diamonds on you like a glass of lemonade
QB, I'll throw it
Teeth white, Newports
I want knees like shorts
80 thousand dollar Birkin bag in the Porsche
I'm tryna fuck with you 'til we on life support
I'll split it with you if we get half of Michael Jordan
No toilet tissue, I shit on niggas 'cause life is short (facts)
No passport to go with me, I had to get deported

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams  & Young Thug]
Release, let go, and have a good time
Have a good, have a good time, yeah
Have a good, have a good time
Release, let go, and have a good time
Let's have a good, have a good time, yeah

Hunnid' bottles in the club, real one room
Girl you gotta keep up with a boss move
King of the jungle, tycoon

We just wanna party, way back in the war room
Do you want some? No I don't, son
Tryna watch me ballin', do you want money?
I'm just tryna turn up, tryna work something

[Intro]
Higher... uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Been running 'round in circles tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy while chilling with my friends
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I feel this spark ignite

[Chorus]
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

[Verse 2]
Crazy, what we're doing: living, letting go (Go, go)
Riding, having good times and no one has to know (No, no)
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I feel this spark ignite

[Chorus]
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

You got me open
You dig it deeper

[Verse 1]
I looked in my rear view mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

[Verse 2]
Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we've found it (Found it)
Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)
You're sayin' "Baby, don't worry"
But we're still goin' the wrong way

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

Coastin' like crazy

[Bridge]
They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And sometimes I feel like I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know that we can find our way home

[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was

Honeymoon Avenue, my baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue

Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

[Outro]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in-
Traffic, I'm under pressure, pressure
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on
(Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue)
(Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue)

Let's just go back, b-b-b-back, back, back

[Verse: Ariana Grande, Mr. Baggett]
Where do you turn?
When there's no one to turn to?
When it's so hard to cope
How can you start to make a change?
Maybe learn to
What do you need?
(Hope)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande with Jim Carrey]
Hope is the song
When the world is a menace
Hope is an open door
Maybe getting back up again is
What falls are for

I thought that I was a hopeless romantic (Thought that I)
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic (Sheesh)
I really thought that I'd be like my grandparents
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic (Thought that I)

[Verse 1]
Say you want me anyway, do ya?
You can handle all this fame, can ya?
Like me just the way I are
Just the way I, way I are, yeah, yeah
You would like me anyway, would ya?
You won't let me get away, won't ya?
Like me just the way I are
Say you don't wanna be a star, do you?

[Pre-Chorus]
We step out on a Friday night
New front page, it's a cute headline
I made you a thing, like, "Who's that guy?"
Say you ain't in it for the spotlight, boy

[Chorus]
I don't believe no one no more
Boy, show me what you're in it for
Been on the low when it comes to love (When it comes, when it comes to love)
Said, "Do you like how I look or just how I look on you?"

[Verse 2]
Cover on a magazine in just two weeks
"Boy to Watch", ain't he just, just too sweet?
Now he ain't even got time for me
I only see him on the big screen
Woke up at like five, and boy, you wasn't here
When it's my fault, she even knows that you're there
Was I just a transition?
Boy, remember where ya come from


[Pre-Chorus]
We step out on a Friday night
New front page, it's a cute headline
I made you a thing, like, "Who's that guy?"
Say you ain't in it for the spotlight, boy

[Chorus]
I don't believe no one no more
Boy, show me what you're in it for (In it for)
Been on the low when it comes to love (When it comes to love)

You got your hands up, got the bands up
Got your head held high like you're starstruck
You a boss, you know how to run a bag up
You know you gon' win the race, tell 'em catch up
Trail-blazing, don't it feel amazing?
Knowing that you're the rose growing out the pavement
After everything said and done, you done made it

With the bases loaded, bunch of home runs
If the outcome is more income
Then adjust your crown, job well done

[Intro]
H-H-H-Holy shit!
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Niggas always hatin', what they talking 'bout?
See 'em in traffic, wanna talk it out
Just bought an S Class, I'm always in the backseat
But I ain't that scrub Chilli talkin' bout
Ayy, rich nigga thing I sign a blank check
Hit her, get the wave back since niggas doing wave checks
If I ain't paved the way, then it ain't paved yet
And you niggas stealing styles still ain't paid yet
Niggas say I'm broke, but your Bentley need a brake check
Driving fast on accident, I still ain't been late yet
Hide my dog, but your momma wanna play vet
And she just gave me head like she ain't ate yet
I used to want the Rollie, but these niggas got 'em
Pouring champagne on they wrist, just to waste a bottle
Lookin' stupid as a bitch
When it's all said and done, you lookin' stupid for the bitch, nigga

[Chorus]
Ayy, fuck being humble
Fuck all that humble shit
Fuck being humble
Fuck all that humble shit
I hope you niggas crumble
Y'all on some other shit
Fuck being humble
Fuck all that humble shit


[Verse 2]
Ayy, my old partner crossed me, gotta land that bih
Run and tag, but I didn't miss
Then I put 40 in his pockets and I rose him from the dead
Better be lucky I ain't put it on his head
Niggas used to fuck my bitch, I ain't lying
And they come to shake my hand and when I heard, I could'a died
I could've got them bitch niggas ridin', 'til I see them walk around tryna see about a job
My new girl drive dead, it's a murder
Finna break up with her, 'cause I feel like I don't deserve her
Sometimes I try to re-get the number and surprise her with some shit, 'cause I'm still tryna earn her
Fuck being humble, niggas never been on shit
I'm on three floors in a crib, we converse through intercom
And when this shit get poppin', do not hit my phone
Bitch

[Chorus]
Ayy, fuck being humble
Fuck all that humble shit
Fuck being humble
Fuck all that humble shit
I hope you niggas crumble
Y'all on some other shit
Fuck being humble
Fuck all that humble shit


[Outro]

[Verse 1]
I'm so close I can taste it
The man on the moon keep playing
Practical jokes, planting the mirrors and smoke
That I fade away in
You be complaining
And I can't explain it
I guess, nothin' compare to the feeling
The feeling amazing
Now I'm switchin' location
'Cause Heaven too far when you live in the basement
I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis
Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm
Before I drive myself crazy

[Chorus]
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't tell me to stop
Let me keep goin' until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
Hittin' the ground, I'm hittin' the ground, I fell from the top
You never expect to drop, so hold on, but
That just the way it goes, your God don't wait for no one
And when that's all you know, it keep you on your toes
You got so far to go, but look at where you came from

[Chorus]
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see


[Intro]
I don't wanna be, to be alone, baby
Unless I'm alone, unless I'm alone with ya
Cause it won't be, cause it won't be
Cause it won't be, cause it won't
I hold you close, I hold you close, darling
The way that I use to, the way that I use to
Cause it won't be, cause it won't be
Cause it won't be, cause it won't...

[Verse 1]
There's people on the sidewalk, there's music in the air
everyone is smiling, I'm wishing you were here
To put this smile on my face, the way that you used to do
Cause all I want for Christmas, is Christmas time with you
I don't wanna spend this time without you
I just want to hold you close to me
Kiss beside the Christmas tree
Baby, say you'll be coming home

[Chorus]
I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)

I just want to hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be (It won't be)
Unless I'm alone with you

[Verse 2]
Sittin' by the fire, I'll hold you in my arms
Keep from the cold night, you'll be safe and warm
We raise a glass together, to love that never dies
I'll be spending Christmas, looking in your eyes
There's no better time to be together
There's no sadder time to be alone
Hurry back and please come home
Stay with me and make my dreams come true

[Chorus]
I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be Christmas
I just want to hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be (It won't be)
Unless I'm alone with you

[Bridge]
I don't wanna spend this time without you
I just want to hold you close to me
Kiss beside the Christmas tree
Baby, say you'll be coming home
Coming home

[Chorus]
I don't want to be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be Christmas
I just want to hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be (It won't be)

[Intro]
Mmm, I, mmm

[Verse 1]
Share my life
Take me for what I am
Cause I'll never change
My colors for you
Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you


[Verse 2]
You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love, mmm
I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive
One I can hold on to?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Your love I'll remember forever

[Chorus]
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing


Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
No, don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, baby ohhh, ooo

Get in the car like, "Skrrt"
Staying up all night, order me pad thai
Then we gon' sleep 'til noon
Me with no makeup, you in the bathtub
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never act this regular

Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world

[Verse 2]
Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, "Ooh"
Feels like forever, baby, I never thought that it would be you
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit
That's how I know it's true
Baby, direct it, name in the credits

Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes

[Chorus]
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?

[Part 2: My Favorite Things]

[Verse]
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

[Chorus]
When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so-oh-oh-ooh

[Part 3: 7 rings]

[Intro]
(Dam-dum, dam-dum, yeah, ah-ah) [Laughter]
(Oh-woah-oh-oh-yeah-ey) (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles (Hmm)
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble (Oh-oh)
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines (Hmm)
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage? (Ah-ah)
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs." (Gon' be no "Mrs.")
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches (Oh, yeah)
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches (Riches)
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms, yeah-eh

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin'
The way it shine, I know you've seen it
I bought a crib just for the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it

[Verse 3]
So gen', my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want, baby

[Part 4: thank u, next]

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle, holding hands with my momma
I'll be thanking my dad, 'cause he's really awesome
Only wanna do it once, real bad, gon' make that last
God forbid something happens, least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love, got so much patience
I've learned from the pain (Pain)

Ladies with an attitude
Fellows that were in the mood
Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothing to it

Dietrich and DiMaggio
Marlon Brando, Jimmy Dean
On the cover of a magazine

Like rain onto the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
I got it, I got it, I got it, got it, baby, baby

[Chorus: IeW]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
(Anything you want done baby)
I do it naturally

every one, from A to Z
Whoa, (Oh) whoa, (Oh) whoa

[Verse 4: Vogue]
Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so

[Chorus: Vogue]
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (Move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

And don't bother to compare

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]

I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

Without the halo, wingless angel

So baby, come light me up
And maybe I'll let you on it

Into you
Into you

Baby, this a microphone checkup
What you getting into when you get up?
When I wake up early, I'ma text ya
Heard you got a man
Baby, I could do it better
And it really ain't the plan
I just want you to remember
How it was, how it is, how it could be
You could pull me in, you could push me
Or we can go for a ride, you the sky
Looking up, you a high
You ain't never gotta lie
Cause it's more than just pussy
For the night, everything's alright
When you lay down, I'ma hit the lights
(If you say so)
And what's a life if you don't got me?
Give you what you want, what you need
(What you came for)
Hit me up when you're feeling blue
And I'll tell how I'm feeling too, so you know
I just want to get into you
Right here in the living room
Let's go

Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment

Completely focused, my mind is open

Nothing to prove and

The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing

The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger

Oh, I promise you




[Intro]
Welcome to this Christmas
Only comes one time a year, don't miss this
I just wanna welcome you to Christmas
Let me sneak into your speakers, listen
I'll be singing, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"
I'll be singing, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"




[Verse 1]
In your hands
I turn into something better than I am
I forget just where I end and you begin
Baby, I'm the only one that gave a damn
So take my hand

I wanna run
We could run like waterfalls and chase the sun
We could stay up late, so faded and get dumb
Baby, you're the only one I wanna love
So let's run

[Pre-Chorus]
My fingertips trace the silhouette of your skin (your skin)
And your lips taste like heaven
But I'll taste them with gin
Body talk, 'cause you understand
With your hands, I'm in your hands

[Drop]
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh

[Verse 2]
You're the paint, I'm the canvas
Color me just what I am (hey)
I'll be every masterpiece you ever made (oh, oh)
I know I'm risky, I'm the risk you wanna take
Ain't no mistake (uh, huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
My fingertips trace the silhouette of your skin (your skin)
And your lips taste like heaven
But I'll taste them with gin
Body talk, 'cause you understand (understand)
With your hands, I'm in your hands

[Drop]
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh

[Outro]
Ooh, hey




[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
In your hands
I turn into something better than I am
I forget just where I end and you begin
Baby, I'm the only one that gave a damn
So take my hands
I wanna run
We could run like waterfalls
Then chase the sun
We could savor this or [?] think it's done
Baby, you're the only one I wanna love
So let's run

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Our fingertips chase the soul of your skin (your skin..)
And all your lips taste like heaven
I'll chase them with you
Body talk, 'cause you understand...
Brace your hands, I'm in your hands
Ooh ooh oohooh
Ohh ooooh oohoh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You're the paint
I'm the canvas
Color me just what I am (hey)
I'll be every masterpiece
You will unveil, oh-oh
I know I'm risque
I'm the risk you wanna take
And your mistake, uh-huh

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Our fingertips chase the soul of your skin (your skin..)
And all your lips taste like heaven
Boy, I'll chase them with you
Body talk, 'cause you understand
Brace your hands
I'm in your hands
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
Ooh, hey

You brought me up to my melting point
And your lack of love leaves me paranoid
Oh, oh, and now, how the hell am I supposed to win
When you wear me out and you spread me thin
Oh, oh

It's like you're only here to help yourself
Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
Unfortunate for you, my eyes see clear
And then the second it goes wrong
And darling, you'll be packed up and be gone

Is it time I just let go?
Cause I can't do this on my own
Cause it ain't right, no it ain't right
And I was never good enough
And it ain't right, no it ain't right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain't right, no it ain't right
And I was never good enough
And it ain't right, no it ain't right
I know I did it all for love

Started strong without a care
And as time went on you left me bare
Oh, oh, blinded by your faulty truth
It didn't take me long to see through you
Oh, oh

It's like you're only here to help yourself
Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
Unfortunate for you, my eyes see clear
And then the second it goes wrong
And darling you'll be packed up and be gone

Is it time I just let go?
Cause I can't do this on my own
Cause it ain't right, no it ain't right
And I was never good enough
And it ain't right, no it ain't right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain't right, no it ain't right
And I was never good enough
And it ain't right, no it ain't right
I know I did it all for love

I took off too fast
I jumped overboard
I would have finished last
So I, I'm shoving you down
There's nothing I need
When you're around

Is it time I just let go?
Cause I can't do this on my own
Cause it ain't right, no it ain't right
And I was never good enough
And it ain't right, no it ain't right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain't right, no it ain't right
And I was never good enough
And it ain't right, no it ain't right
I know I did it all for love


[Verse 1: Victoria]
Carolers singing
Sleigh bells are ringing
It's that time of year
everyone's toasting
Chestnuts are roasting
Christmas time is near
Something's missing and I'm wishing
Wishing that you knew

[Pre-Chorus 1: Victoria, elizabeth & Ariana]
How much it would mean to spend this Christmas time with you
So if you feel it coming
On this special day
Just trust your heart
Don't let your head get in the way

[Chorus 1: Victoria, elizabeth & Ariana]
'Cause it's Christmas
And the start of something new
Oh it's Christmas
And I hope you will feel it too

Candy canes and mistletoes
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
But all of it means nothing
Without you


[Verse 2: Victoria, elizabeth & Ariana]
Just for a minute, you get a feeling
Look up in the sky
Santa's here, so get in the spirit
Just give it a try
Children beaming and I'm dreaming
Hoping that it's true

[Pre-Chorus 2: Victoria, elizabeth & Ariana]
'Cause it would mean so much to spend this Christmas time with you!
So if you feel it comin'
On the special day
Just trust your heart
Cause I can't wait to hear you say

[Chorus 2: Victoria, elizabeth & Ariana, Leon]
That it's Christmas!
And the start of something new
Well it's Christmas, and I hope you will feel it too

everyone together sing
Silver bells, and golden rings
But all of it means nothing
Without you (No no no no)

[Outro: Victoria & Leon with elizabeth & Ariana]
It's not Christmas without you-you-you
It's not Christmas without you-you-you
It's not Christmas without you-you-you
It's not Christmas without you

[Intro: Victoria & All]
Huh, ohhh whoa
Let me tell you now, ooooh
Ooooh

[Verse 1: Victoria & All]
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Chorus 1: Victoria with All]
Oh baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me?
(Back in your heart)
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms

[Refrain: All with Victoria]
(I want you back)
Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na, na, na, na


[Verse 2: Victoria Justice]
Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now

[Chorus 1: Victoria with All]
Oh baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me?
(Back in your heart)
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms, oh

[Bridge: Leon with All, Ariana]
A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need


[Chorus 2: Leon, Ariana, elizabeth, All, Leon, Victoria, All, elizabeth, Leon]
Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh (I want you back)
Forget what happened then (I want you back)
Let me live again
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now, since I see you in his arms (I want you back)
Spare me of this 'cause (I want you back)
Give me back what I lost

[Outro: Victoria, Leon & Ariana, All]
Oh baby, I need one more chance, ha
I tell you that I love you
Now baby, oh, baby, oh, baby
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

[Verse 1]
If there's a prize for rotten judgement
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history; been there, done that

Who'd you think you're kiddin'?
He's the earth and heaven to ya
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya (Oh nooo)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you feel
And who you're thinking of

[Chorus 1]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(You swoon, you sigh)
(Why deny it? Uh-oh)
It's too cliche
I won't say I'm in love

[Verse 2]
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming "Get a grip, girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"


[Pre-Chorus]
(Ohhh...)
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
(Oh, no)
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up
That you got, got, got it bad?

[Chorus 2]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(Give up, give in)
(Check the grin; you're in love)
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love
(You're doin' flips)
(Read our lips: "You're in love")

[Verse 3]
You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
(Girl, don't be proud!)
(It's okay, you're in love)


[Outro]
Ohhh...
At least out loud
I won't say I'm in love
(Shoo do, shoo do, shoo do, shoo do)
(Sha-la-la-la la la, ahh)

[Snippet]

[Verse 1]
He will if you won't get you a jada (Get you a jada)
Be there when I get home now
I don't know, what you've been told
But you should know-

[Verse 2]
That you don't fuck around with me
That you don't fuck around with me



[Verse 1]
Yeah, you really tried
But I was blind to all the lies you told me, boy
All the shit you've done
You can't outrun the way you undersold me, hey

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You acted like you bought me at a bargain sale
You don't even care
You focused your frustration on a small detail
Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail

[Chorus]
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
And I'm taking it right back, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm no blow up doll, no free-for-all
No slave to your decision, ooh
Gotta find a way to break the spell
To get the hell away from those who block my vision

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You used me as a fragment of your grand design, hey
And you, you don't get to put me on your bottom line
You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine

[Chorus]
Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why would I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, baby

[Chorus]
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
And I'm taking it right back, hey
Taking it right back, baby
I'm taking it right back, hey




[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell that you were just with her

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say
I know I'm not your only

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just a little bit, oh-oh, ooh, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
I know I'm not your only, but at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none

[Chorus]
Oh, babe
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit, my baby)
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want (Is all I want)
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for


[Intro]
Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now

[Verse 1]
How did you know? It's what I always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?

[Chorus]
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

[Interlude]
Bite tongue, deep breaths
Count to ten, nod your head

[Verse 2]
I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it
Pour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me


[Chorus]
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

[Bridge]
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Wake up in my bed, I just wanna have a good day (Mmm, ah)
Think it in my head, then it happens how it should, ayy
Twelve o'clock, I got a team meeting, then a meditation at like 1:30
Then I ride to the studio listening to some shit I wrote (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Good karma, my aesthetic (Aesthetic)
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it (Yeah), I finessed it (I finessed it)
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven

[Chorus]
Just like magic (Baby), just like magic (Oh yeah)
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic (Yeah), I'm attractive (Oh yeah)
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Looking at my phone, but I'm tryna disconnect it (Oh yeah)
Read a fuckin' book, I be tryna stay connected (Yeah)
Say it's tricky at the top, gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet
Losing friends left and right, but I just send 'em love and light (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Good karma, my aesthetic (My aesthetic)
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it (Ooh), I finessed it (Ooh)
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven

[Chorus]
Just like magic, just like magic
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it (Ayy)
Just like magic, I'm attractive
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it

[Bridge]
I don't wanna waste your time on some dumb shit
Password to your phone, you can miss me with that shit
Redesign your brain, we gon' make some new habits
Just like magic (Just like magic), just like magic

[Chorus]
Just like magic (Baby), just like magic (Oh)
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic (Oh), I'm attractive (Ah, yeah)
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it ('Cause I attract it, babe)

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm (Oh)
Mmm-oh, yeah
Mmm, yeah, mmm

He ain't the one, you better run from him
Used to get to me mentally

If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Loving me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time

[Verse 1]
Driving down sunset on a Saturday night
It's getting kinda crazy under the lights
And we don't care we're passing our time
Watching those L.A. boys roll by
In their drop tops, Harleys, escalades too
A hundred different flavors to vary your view
There's one for me and there's one for you
Watching them L.A. boys roll through

[Chorus]
Looking so hot down in Hollywood
You know they got, got the goods
So lets give it up for those L.A. boys
Riding the waves up in Malibu
They really get, get to you
So lets give it up for those L.A. boys
Give it up, give it up, you don't have no choice
Give it up, give it up for those L.A. boys

[Verse 2]
West side, east side, everywhere between
Rock stars jam in the promenade for free
Flipping their skateboards on Venice beach
LA boys, come play with me
Turn it up, turn it up
And come play with me

[Chorus]
Looking so hot down in Hollywood
You know they got, got the goods
So lets give it up for those L.A. boys
Riding the waves up in Malibu
They really get, get to you
So lets give it up for those L.A. boys

[Bridge]
I put your number in my phone
Maybe I'll call you maybe not
Whatchu you doing all alone
Come show me what you got boy
Show me what you got got boy
What you got boy
Show me what you got

[Chorus]
Looking so hot down in Hollywood
You know they got, got the goods
So lets give it up for those L.A. boys
Riding the waves up in Malibu

[Outro]
Give it up for the L.A. boys

[Verse 1]
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah (It's The Rascals!)

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
Thought we belong together
At least that's what you said
I should have known better
You broke my heart again
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

How could you leave Christmas morning?
You broke my heart with no warning
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

[Outro]
This is our last, last Christmas
You broke my heart
Last, last Christmas
You broke my heart
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
You blew it
You do it, do it?

Baby Loves:
[Intro]
Baby loves, I'm tryin' to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
I think I'll rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's looking at it too
And I don't know what to do

I can't explain how I feel
And I say love love
Oh love my love
Oh love
Love
Oh I'm trying to say that you are my everything
But every time I try to say they just copulate
And I say love love
Love I've never felt that way before
What I feel about you is unique
Keep, I belong to you
If possible
To tell you i love you so much
Words are not enough
Oh love my love
Oh love love
Oh I'm trying to tell you that you are my everything
But every time I try to tell you
They just get complicated
And I say love
Oh love
Love
Love
Oh ooh
every time I try to tell you that you are my everything
They just get complicated
every time I try to tell you that you are my everything
They just get complicated

[Pre-Chorus]
You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh babe
Baby
Been a minute since I had something so sweet

[Chorus]
If you're gonna keep speaking my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feeling anxious

Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night

Why would I double back or do the same thing twice?
A question, something that I can't deny
Leave my baggage at the door, I'll claim you mine
All mine

You hold it down with every word you speak, oh babe

Ain't no need to remind ya, it's AG in your face

[Chorus]
If you're gonna keep speaking my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feeling anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night

[Outro]
Head over my shoes like woah
Know you like an inside joke
Running 'cause you're just my speed
'Less you want it in slo-mo (In slo-mo)
I'm not what you had before ('Fore)
Your ex-girlfriend don't want no smoke (Smoke)
I ain't tryna sign no lease
I'm just gon' make you my home


[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (Lo-love me harder)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain


[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make it feel like the first time

[Chorus: Ariana Grande, The Weeknd]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (I'ma love you harder, hey!)

Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus: breathin]

[Verse 2: breathin]
Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

[Pre-Chorus: breathin]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated

[Verse 1]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised
even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Ohh yeah

[Verse 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

[Bridge]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie


[Verse 1]
How do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? (Mmm)
When you're not really there? (Ah, yeah, mmm)
How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in?
Oh yeah, baby, just come on in
Ooh yeah
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? (Oh, ayy)
Baby, let's just forget (Ooh)
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?

[Chorus]
Baby, let's fall in love
Ooh
Baby, let's fall in love
Ooh
Baby, let's fall in love
Ooh
Baby, let's fall
Baby, let's fall
Baby, let's fall in love



[Verse 2]
I just broke up with my ex
Now I'm out here single, I don't really know what's next
But I ain't even trippin', I'ma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex and
You're the one I'm feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don't normally say this but goddamn
You the best, best, best

[Chorus]
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

[Verse 3]
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

[Chorus]
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you


[Verse 4]
Been friends for a minute
So you know just what I like
You know my mind
even seen boys come and go
So you know what makes me cry
See, you're the one that treat me right

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
(You're no good, but it's time I love you, baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
(But it's time I love you, yeah, yeah, ah)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
(I'm looking for love)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
(You're looking for love baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

She's just looking for love

[Verse 1]
Hold up, wait
Before you go, just stay
And talk to me for a little
Baby, won't you loosen up just a little, eh?

[Pre-Chorus]
See, what you don't understand
Is falling in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I'll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doing, doing

[Chorus]
Nothing but lovin' you
Nothing but lovin' you, baby

I adore you
So let me make it clear to you, that boy, you're all I need
My baby

Nothing but lovin' you

I like to fuck with you just to make up with you
'Cause the way you be screamin' my name

I might break up with you just to make up with you
At the end of the day, boy

Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops, surprise, surprise

[Verse 3]
Promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick

No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life, just like that Fenty Beauty kit
Boy, you know what it is

And I find that it works every time

[Intro]
Okay, yuh
You ready?
Where my "make up" stans at?
Right there, right here
Let me see y'all, let's go

[Verse 1]
I like to fuck with you just to make up with you
'Cause the way you be screamin' my name
Make me wanna make love to you
I might break up with you just to make up with you
At the end of the day, boy
You know that I'm 'bout to wake up

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
Love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

[Verse 2]
energy and attitude don't really coincide
Stayin' mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops (Surprise, surprise)

[Chorus]
Said I love it when we make (Up, yeah-eh-eh)
(Go 'head, ruin my makeup, yeah-eh-eh)
(I love it when we make up, yeah-eh-eh)
(Go 'head, ruin my makeup, yeah-eh-eh)

[Verse 3]
So promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick
That's the way to shut me up after an argument
No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life (Just like that Fenty Beauty kit)

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
Love it when we (Make up, yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

[Bridge]
Let me stay in my bag 'cause I like when you mad
It's a mood, it's a vibe, it's a look (It's a match)
(Attitude, dream of mine) Dream of mine
(When you say that I'm right) Say that I'm right, baby
(And I find that it works every time)

[Chorus]
'Cause I love it when we (Make up, yeah-eh-eh)
Yeah, you love it when we make up
(Go 'head, ruin my makeup)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup
(I love it when we make up, ah)
Said I love it when we
(Go 'head, ruin my makeup, yuh)
Go ahead, ruin my makeup, let's go

Once upon a time when I was just a kid
You never let me do just what the older kids did
But lose that laundry list of what you won't allow...

[TRACY, AMBeR & PeNNY]
'Cause Mama, I'm a big girl now!

[AMBeR]
Once upon a time I used to play with toys
But now I'd rather play around with teenage boys
So if I get a hickey, please don't have a cow!

[TRACY, AMBeR & PeNNY]
'Cause Mama, I'm a big girl now!

[PeNNY]
Ma, I gotta tell you that without a doubt I got my best dancing lessons from you
You're the one who taught me how to twist and shout because you shout non-stop and you're so twisted too!
Woah oh oh oh oh...

[TRACY]
Once I used to fidget 'cause I just sat home

[AMBeR]
But now I'm just like Gidget and I gotta get to Rome!

Hey Mama, Say Mama-

Once upon a time I was a shy young thing
Could barely walk and talk so much as dance and sing
But let me hit the stage, I wanna take my bow

[TRACY, AMBeR & PeNNY]
'Cause Mama I'm a big girl now!

[AMBeR]
Woah, once upon a time I used to dress up Ken
But now that I'm a woman, I like bigger men
And I don't need a Barbie doll to show me how

[TRACY, AMBeR & PeNNY]
'Cause Mama, I'm a big girl now!

Ma, you always taught me what was right from wrong
And now I just wanna give it a try
Mama, I've been in the nest for far too long
So please give a push and mama watch me fly...

[AMBeR]
Watch me fly!

[eNSeMBLe]
Hey mama! Say mama!

[PeNNY]
Someday I will meet a man you won't condemn-

[AMBeR]
And we will have some kids and you can torture them-

[TRACY]
But let me be a star before I take that vow

[TRACY, AMBeR & PeNNY]
'Cause Mama, I'm a big girl now...

[PeNNY]
Woah oh, oh oh oh!

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Real classy how I slip into your mind
And I'm kinda shy, I'm not gemini
You say my love is like the sweetest drug you've tried
I can't switch it up, gotta press the trial

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling head over heels, you like to feel
One touch and I'll give you chills
Make it then, one kiss and it made me feel
You know the drill, one night and you feel fulfilled
This is the thrill

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Can you handle me?
I think you're fuckin' with me (with me)
I know you wanna kiss me (kiss me)
I know you gonna miss me (miss me), miss me

I know you wanna kiss me
I know you gonna miss me, miss me, yeah

[Verse 1: Victoria Monet]
I've been on a roll, where you been?
Real protective with my soul, where you been?
Is your GPS even on, where you been?
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Chorus: Victoria Monet]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I swerve both ways, dichotomy

[Post-Chorus: Victoria Monet & Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin
How you hit the club and you barely got in?
Then we hit the bank, making them investments for the win, oh

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Said, I been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been


[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I show them my discography (Yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin (Hey)
You'd be straight for life if I gave you my PIN (Yeah)
even though we gave up that 90 percent for the win, go

[Verse 3: Victoria Monet & Ariana Grande]
I've been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, hell nah
I don't even care where you been (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
The sun is setting and you're right here by my side
And the movie is playing, but we won't be watching tonight
every look (every look), every touch (every touch)
Makes me wanna give you my heart
I be crushin' on you, baby
Stay right where you are, 'cause

[Chorus]
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight

[Verse 2]
I kiss his fingertips as I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me elvis with some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips (Puts his lips) on my neck (On my neck)
Makes me wanna give him my body
I be fallin' for you, baby, and I just can't stop, 'cause

[Chorus]
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
(Baby, I be fallin')
You're my moonlight, moonlight

[Outro]
He's so bossy, he makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when he's holding me tight
And he calls me "moonlight" too

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Doja Cat]
Baby, tell me what's your motive? (Tell me, baby)
What's your motive? (What's your motive?)
What's your motive? (What's your motive?, ah)
So tell me, what's your motive? (Better tell me, baby)
What's your motive? (What's your motive?; Better tell me, baby)
What's your motive? (Yeah, ayy, ah)

[Verse 1]
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

[Chorus]
He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

[Verse 2]
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know "sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are


[Chorus]
You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

[Outro]
Ooh, hmm, ha, yeah
You are, you are, you are, ooh
You are, you are, you are
My everything

[Intro: Ariana Grande]
I don't know why, but I think that he makes me smile

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart
Why would it even try?
Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever
I know you far too smart
Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober
This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Ariana Grande, both]
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part (Oh)
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love, yeah, yeah


[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
If you wanna stay, we're taking it slow, baby
'Cause you want me, and I got enough on my mind
But I can make some time for something so divine, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Ariana Grande]
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

[Verse 1]
Said I'ma give you some instructions
That you can't be scared to try
I want you to touch it softly
Like the way you do my mind
It got body and it's smooth to touch
The same way as my skin
But don't you be scared

[Chorus]
To run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair

[Verse 2]
It's been way long overdue
Just like these inches down my back
Usually don't let people touch it
But tonight, you get a pass
Spend my dimes and spend my time
To keep it real, sometimes it's tracks
But I don't care, mmm

[Chorus]
So run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair


[Bridge]
Know this ain't usually me
But I might let it down for ya (Mmm)
This ain't usually me (Usually me)
But I might let it down for ya

[Chorus]
So run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
So come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, don't you be scared
Come run your hands through my hair

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse]
While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy
If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more, but
My heart belongs to daddy

[Chorus]
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
And so I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know that you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to daddy
'Cause my daddy
He treats it
So well

[Verse]
We the best, boy, you better keep one or think twice
Notice I'm the best one to keep by
Guess I shouldn't stay so-

[Chorus]
You say I learn the lessons on the hard way
It take every ounce of effort just to parley
Boy, it's always in my favor, it go my way, my way



[Intro: Shangela Laquifa Wadley]
This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don't wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain't no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Bridge]
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
(Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)

[Outro]
I'd rather be alone tonight (Mmm)
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Ah, hmm-mmm

[Bridge]
Boy, you know the vibes, I don't waste no time
Take what's on your mind, make it real life
Get all the homies to bounce
Switch from the bed to the couch
And get to know how I'm feelin' inside
So much conversation, words so sweet
Been so well-behaved, but, boy, I'm weak
Yeah, my body's gotta say something to you
That's one way to tell I speak the truth

Don't wanna wait on it (Baby, I)

[Verse 1]
If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I'll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can't help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

You said you'd never forget her
And she said she could change your life
It happened on the day you met her
A love at first sight made you blind

But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

And no one could love you like me

[Intro: ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande]
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely

[Verse 1: ed Sheeran]
Another night, another club
Another room, another one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
I don't know why, you're not enough

[Pre-Chorus: ed Sheeran]
No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy

[Chorus: ed Sheeran]
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Another night, another day
Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now
This ain't man's world, thank you next, I'ma go my own way
Sometimes being solo is the way to go
When you need to figure shit out
And if I want you boy, I'ma tell you so
'Cause I'm the one in control, yeah

[Chorus: ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande]
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark

[Post-Chorus: ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande]
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Yuh), no lo-lo-love for the lonely (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus: ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande]
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me, yeah
My love is a flickering candle (Flickering candle, yeah), in the dark

[Post-Chorus: ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande]
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Yuh), no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark (No lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (Love for the lonely), no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark

[Outro: ed Sheeran & Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande]
And I will try to find someone to hold me (Mhm)
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark




[Verse 1]
I know you want what's best for me
I know you've been waiting patiently
You got my hand over the fire
I know you wanna take me higher

[Pre-Chrous]
I don't wanna jump until I'm sure
It's not like my heart is insecure
The moment I'm ready
I'll just know it
I'm gonna know it

[Chrous]
Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time and I'll take you there
Oh no, baby, not today
But love, come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time
And I'll take you there

[Verse 2]
You make it hard, boy to resist
A little more space
I must insist
Too close
You're intoxicating
Makes me wonder why I'm waiting

[Pre-Chrous]
I'll give up the fight
When I know it's right
Baby, baby, not tonight
Oh oh, a little more time

I want it
A little more time
And I'll take you there

[Bridge]
Only time can tell me if this is real
Or if we're rushing how we feel
Is it my imagination?
Is it a perfect situation?
No
I didn't wanna fall in love
But you made me go and do it
And now you gotta prove it
A little more time and I'll take you there

[Chrous]
Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time and I'll take you there

Oh no, baby not today
But love, come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time and I'll take you there

[Outro]

I'm praying we don't fuck this up (Ah-ah-ah, babe)

[Pre-Chorus]
Others that I've had had to impress me before
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

[Chorus]
Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? (Ooh)
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?


[Verse 2]
Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon
Maybe you should pack a suitcase too (Too)
I love the thought of you never leavin' (No)
Days repeatin'
Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'
Never thought I'd believe in love again

Could I be more obvious? (Obvious)

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Will I ever love the same way again? (Way again)
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't need to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? (Next life)
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady)
But I just wanna know is love completely off the table?

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Will you be there? (Will you be there?)
Can I still love you? (Can I, can I, babe?)

Just wanna know is love completely off the table?

[Verse 2: The Weeknd, Ariana Grande & Both]
I'll wait for you
even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (You can see right through it)
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills (Oh yeah, yeah)
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms (Your arms)
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table


[Chorus: Ariana Grande & The Weeknd]
Will you be there? (Yes, I will be there for you)
Can I still love you? (Yes, I been hurt before, before)
Not yet healed or ready (Not ready)

Just wanna know is love completely off the table?

[Bridge: Ariana Grande & The Weeknd]
So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me? (Oh, no-no, no)
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head (Oh, woah)
Tryna be here from this bed (Oh)
Just wanna know, just wanna know, know, know, baby (Hey)
Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby? (Oh, hey)
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully (Baby, don't leave)
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again (Woah)
Baby, baby (Woo-hoo)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & The Weeknd]

Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Will I ever love the same way again? (Way again)
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear I don't mean to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?

Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? (Next life)
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed or ready
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady)
But I just wanna know is love completely off the table?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

So put on that red suit and make him appear
Because Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, ole Kris Kringle, save me

The tree's all sparkly and gold
But inside, I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa, won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?

I feel this void inside
And I just can't take it

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mariah Carey, (Ariana Grande), both & all]
I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
(And then I swore to myself)
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas night

[Chorus: All]
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas night

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey, (Jennifer Hudson), Ariana Grande, *Mariah & Ariana* & all]
(Oh, Santa)
(I heard that it's really gonna)
(Snow this year)
So, I hope Rudolph
And those other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up
And swoop him down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good
This year
So put on that red suit
And make him appear
*Because Christmas cheer*
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, old Kriss Kringle, save me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mariah Carey, (Jennifer Hudson), Ariana Grande & Mariah & Ariana]
They say it's unrealistic
(But I believe in you, Saint Nick)
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas night

[Chorus: All]
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas night

[Bridge: Jennifer Hudson & (Mariah Carey)]
Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa
(Come on, Santa)

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine, mine
Oh, Santa
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas
Oh, Santa
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine, mine

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande, *Mariah & Ariana* & all]
Oh, Santa Claus
If you get this letter
Please don't make me wait
*'Cause all December*
*I've been counting down the days*
*So hop on your sleigh*
*I promise that I won't forget*
*The milk and cookies*
The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the north pole
Santa won't you come
And make him mine this Christmas night

[Outro: Mariah Carey, Jennifer Hudson & Ariana Grande]
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine, oh, oh, oh
(Santa's coming to make you mine)
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas
(I know he will)
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine, oh, oh, oh
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine, mine
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine, oh, oh, oh
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas
(I know he will)
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine, mine
Santa's gonna come and make him
Mine this Christmas




[Verse 1]
I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Verse 2]
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Bridge]
Yeah, I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, yeah
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be without you

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home (Takes you home, babe)
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart, babe
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah

Can't you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself

[Verse 1]
Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's no one around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?

[Pre-Chorus]
That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

[Chorus]
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

[Verse 2]
As I'm laying down with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew

[Pre-Chorus]
I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

[Chorus]
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, hard to believe, bae
That the love you have is on-, is only mine
That's how I know

[Chorus]
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met

[Intro]
It's like, it's like, it's like

[Refrain]
It's like make-believe
Something that the fans can't see
Like a fantasy, except it's real
The fairies tell stories of how we laugh
The rainbow's jealous of what we have, except it's real

[Verse 1]
Not to be annoying, not to be annoying
But I wanna keep it going
It's like a epic poem except the letters growing
Punctuate it with the moment, it's so real

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep me stressed out, stressed out, stressed out, stressed, boy
Stressed out, stressed out
The way you stretch it out, stretched out, stretched out, stretch it
Just stretched out, stretch it out

[Chorus]
And it's unconditional
On top of everything, hey
I cannot make this shit up
On top of everything, it's so real


[Post-Chorus]
Lucky to be your lover, heartbeat won't lose
Whole-body buzzing, feel it in your shoes
The way I do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Lucky to be your lover, heartbeat won't lose
Whole-body buzzing, feel it in your shoes
The way I do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay

It's like make-believe
Something that the fans can't see

The fairies tell stories of how we laugh
The rainbow's jealous of what we have, except it's real

[Verse 2]
Chapter never closin'
It's like a brand new mornin' every moment it's reloadin'
Not sayin' that it's frozen in fact
It is explodin', when your hand and mine are holding, it's so real


[Pre-Chorus]
You keep me stressed out, stressed out, stressed out, stressed, boy
Stressed out, stressed out
The way you stretch it out, stretched out, stretched out, stretch it

Being "empowered"...... is not the same as being a "bitch"...
HAVING SOMeTHING TO SAY...... is not the same as HAVING A BAD ATTITUDe....

what I meant when I said what I said about not being Sean's ex is that I am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPeRTY / POSSeSSION. I... do not. belong. to anyone. but myself. and neither do you.
I have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because I have come to the realization that I have SO. MUCH. MORe. to talk about. I'm currently making the best music I've ever made in my life, having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people I've ever known, working my ass off every single day, performing / creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day.

I come from a long bloodline of female activists. my aunt Judy was the first Italian american female president of the national press club in Washington DC. I think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long.
Gloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled "After Black Power, Women's Liberation".... and 46 years later... we're still not quite there yet!
If a women has a lot of sex (or any sex for that matter).... she's a "slut".
If a man has sex..... He'S. A. STUD. a BOSSSSSS. a KING.
If a woman even TALKS about sex openly.... she is shamed!
But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women (or more commonly used "bitches"/"hoes"... how lovely) he's had... he is regaled.
If a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!
If a man is seen with a woman... his status is elevated / celebrated. "AWW SHIIIT He SMASHeD!!!1!!1!".

I know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present.
I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating / married to / attached to, having sex with (or not) / seen with.... but by their value as an individual.

I want the people reading this to know that they are MORe THAN enough on their own.
I want the media to please help me with this!!!!!!!!! Please support each other.
I'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like I constantly had to have a boy by my side. After being on my own now for a few months I am realizing that that's just not the case.... I have never felt more present, grounded, and satisfied. I've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more.

One more thought.... my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as I can with my fans. that is something I have done since day one and never plan on changing. it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny, special, personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things I've done / things I'm going through. I don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before. I love y'all with all my heart.... you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me.

"any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke.. She will need her sisterhood." - Gloria Steinem


So the news is out about Sam & Cat. I felt it wasn't my place to make any sort of announcement so I kept quiet until now. I want to thank Nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true, for being a family to me, for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career, and for of course introducing me to many of my fans however many years ago. I want to thank Dan Schneider for allowing me to play such a special, beautiful character who I hid behind for so long. What I mean by that is when I was younger, people loved Cat so much I used to pretend to be more like her. It took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are.... I think that's honestly because I admire her so much. Her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters. Her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work. She always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good

I will always hold Cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult. I know she seems like a simple, daft character (and she is) but she played such a huge part in my life I just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things I love most about her. I think a lot of people could take a page out of her book...... she wouldn't judge anybody by their appearance.... she believed the best in people.... she wasn't afraid of anything or anybody.... she never let people's judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted, acting how she wanted, dressing how she wanted wanted, dying her hair however she wanted... she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real (which is something I personally do all the time but I wish I could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does)

One of my favorite things about Cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder. As we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across. We hold back a little more, protect ourselves a little more and although Cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up, she never changed or lost her childlike wonder. To me that's the bravest, most special thing about her. She actually reminds me a lot of Frankie in that way

So I know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some 'dumb' kids show character . . . . but to me she is actually a lot smarter, stronger and braver than all the rest of us

Hopefully we'll find out one day if Cat & Robbie ever got married. If I had any say in the story from here on out I'd make sure they were happily married with sweet, eccentric, Jewish, artificially red headed babies. Cat would constantly find herself reminding Aunt Sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house. They'd live down the street from Jade and Beck, also happily married with purple and black haired, pale, grungy, beautiful, goth babies. :)

Thank you to the cast and crew who I spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years. Thanks for lighting us beautifully, shooting us beautifully, making the most incredible props, yelling at us when we were running late to set, keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment. The guys behind the scenes couldn't have been more pleasant or hard working and I appreciate them for that so much. I can't imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in Hollywood

Thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine, Dan Schneider. I will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted

Lastly, thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started... you are the most loyal, dedicated and continuously loving supporters I could ever imagine. We've been through so much and you are still here... and we've got a long way to go. :) Thank you for believing in me, accepting me and loving me. I love you forever

[Verse 1: Nathan Sykes]
From the way you smile
To the way you look
You capture me
Unlike no other
From the first hello
Yeah, that's all it took
And suddenly
We had each other

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
And I won't leave you
Always be true
One plus one, two for life
Over and over again

[Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
I'm telling you
Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment
It will stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again


[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
From the heat of night
To the break of day
I'll keep you safe
And hold you forever
And the sparks will fly
They will never fade
And every day gets better and better

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And I won't leave you
Always be true
One plus one, two for life
Over and over again

So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
I'm telling you
Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment
It will stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again


[Verse 3: Together]
But when I'm with you
I lose track of time
When I'm without you
You're stuck on my mind
I'll be all you need
Until the day that I die
I'll love you
Over and over again

[Bridge: Together]
So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
I'm telling you

[Chorus: Together]
Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment
It will stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again

[Outro: Together]
Over and over again

[Verse 1: Nathan Sykes]

[Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
I'm telling you
Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment
It will stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again


[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
From the heat of night
To the break of day
I'll keep you safe
And hold you forever
And the sparks will fly
They will never fade
And every day gets better and better

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And I won't leave you
Always be true
One plus one, two for life
Over and over again

[Chorus: Nathan Sykes with Ariana Grande]
So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for

We'll never forget this moment
It will stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again


[Verse 3: Together]
But when I'm with you
I lose track of time
When I'm without you
You're stuck on my mind
I'll be all you need
Until the day that I die
I'll love you
Over and over again

[Bridge: Together]
So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
I'm telling you

Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment

[Verse 1]
I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'd find out that my heart was battered
Real hard (Real hard)
It's so hard (It's so hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

[Chorus]
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano, oh

In the end, you'll find out that my heart was mastered
By love (by love)
It's so hard (So hard)

But I'd rather kiss another man who plays the trombone
That makes you wanna dance

[Verse 1]
every day I'm grinding
I don't even get a weekend

So tonight we're gonna flip it

We're gonna hail a cab and don't look back once we get in it

We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty
Pretty, in a pink champagne
Let 'em know our names
Screaming so loud, they'll hear us in L.A
We're popping, like pink champagne (aye, aye)
Popping, like pink champagne (aye, aye)
Popping, like pink champagne

[Post-Chorus]
Make it pop like, make it pop like
Make it pop like, make it pop like, make it pop like


[Verse 2]
We don't need no guest list, everybody's invited
I'm saying, "even if you can't get in, we'll dance outside it"
We're gonna make this bubble
We'll carbonate some trouble
When the line gets flat, gotta take it back to another level

Can't keep it bottled up
Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Both]
You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish
Standing on the field with your pretty pompoms
Now you're working at the movies selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
Cause I'm puttin' down my story in a popular song
Ahh, I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, cause my song is popular

[Chorus: MIKA]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

[Post-Chorus: Both]
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go

[Verse 2: Both]
Always on the lookout for someone to hate
Pickin' on me like a dinner plate
You hid during classes and in between 'em
Dunk me in the toilets now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughing, got everyone clapping, askin'
How come you look so cool?
Cause that's the only thing that I learned at school, boy
Uh huh, I said that's the only thing that I learned at school

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, cause my song is popular

[Chorus: MIKA]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know

[Post-Chorus: Both]
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
That's all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
That's all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
That's all you ever need to know

[Chorus: Both]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car

That's all you ever need to know

Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom

Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you (Ooh woah)
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom

When finding love is a battle
But daylight is so close
So don't you worry 'bout a thing

[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright

[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright

In slow motion
Can't seem to get where we're going
But the hard times are golden
Cause they all lead to better days

[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright

[Refrain]
Baby don't you know

But I really, really doubt you understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little bit of love maybe we can change the world

[Verse 1]
You think you're so small like you're itty-bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking up to strangers on the side of the street, like
A quarter in a cup will get the up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of mind, like
Like it's just a waste of time, like, like, like

[Chorus]
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah

Wishing on a shooting star in the sky
We can do anything if we try
Can't resurrect Ghandi, resurrect King
But if put our heads together we can do anything
Like, you don't have to be a billionaire
You don't have to have much to show to show much care
Like give a wink, give a kiss
Like give a little happiness, like, like, like

[Verse 1]
And you say that I'm the devil you know
And I don't disagree, no, I don't see the harm
They say, "You crazy, just leave him, he'll suffocate you"
But I wanna be in your arms
They say, "No, don't pick up the phone, let him think there's nobody home"
But I'm under your spell
'Cause when you call, my heart starts to roll
I always want more
It's my heaven, my hell

We're heading deep
Inside lives a voice, a voice so quiet

If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
"excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like: "I love you-who starts a conversation like that?" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

Before you speak, don't move

If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move

And I know all my niggas call you crazy, you just misunderstood, though
Through all the evil in your eyes swear I can still see the good, though
But you unlockin' my cell like you is a cop, how you decode
All my V-mails, G-mails even P.O. boxes got me P.O.'d
You saw my emails with CeCe when you wasn't CC'd
I'm on my way to halfway, my baby, I need you to meet me (straight up)
You, you talkin' 'bout I had the key to your heart
Then I got my first european, you took that key then you keyed it

Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you? (Got you, I got you)
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need (Ayy)

Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time (Track of time)

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Ariana Grande]
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement? (What?)
If my Benz turned back to public transportation (So swear)
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting (What?)
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary (Ooh)
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go (I got you)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande, Big Sean]
You should know (Oh) I'm never gonna change (I'm never gonna change)

And fall off, we ain't gon' fall off

You rollin' right by dudes, ain't nobody as fly as you
A boss lady, they do what you order like drive-thrus
No, I'm not the riches, I don't come from money
But I know how money comes and goes
Yeah I balled like Caillou, I said

You gon' ride against the guy, you ain't filthy rich
Yeah I'm Oreo stuntin', she the milky dip
But she ain't never had another love real as this
So baby feel this ish, you know I'm real equipped
With all the tools I'ma bring that gon' treat a girl well
And if you ever want to try to keep it on the low
Just know the yougin' never gonna kiss and tell
I see the silhouette of you behind that shower curtain
I wouldn't need a whole day with you ma, now is perfect
Okay I'm playing though
You know how I lace it down
I love when you whisper Prizzy, behind doors, you say it loud
I ain't with a major crowd, shorty be my entourage
Her ass might be illegal in this state, yeah please don't call the cops
Haters on your page, shades on baby, Ray-Ban
Other chicks compared to mine, garbage, wasteland
Way too many dudes want you, I ain't insecure
They be staring at you, Starbucks Drake Hands
Yeah my buzz go viral, ladies love me no J.T. Smith
Money my medicine and I swear these haters make me sick
Yeah I'm signed to MARS, since 16 I've been an alien
Say I'll never make it baby, J-Bieber and Jaden Smith
Never say never, I be clever than clever
Competition in my way
I sever the heads of these little devils that mess with me
And boy I'm at it, true
Oh girl, I kinda went off-topic, okay back to you
Girl I swear, I ain't find another girl that looks just like a centrefold
That got her life together, woah
You're smart, they don't match you too
Workin', workin' all-day
Poppin', poppin', no molly
Prizzy Pryde kill this, shout to Ariana Grande

[Verse: YNK]
Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
So, don't get mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place

[Pre-Chorus: YNK]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go


[Chorus: YNK]
You will never know what we could have been
If you would've shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know
You'll never know
Boy, you better tell me, tell me
You'll never know
Boy, you coulda let me know
You'll never know
Boy, you could've been there for me
But now you'll never know, you'll never know

[Verse 1: BYHRB]
I shoulda saw it coming
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby, you were so good, so good
You had me going blind
You said he was your best friend
I'm guessing I wasn't your type, hey

[Pre-Chorus: BYHRB]
What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now


[Chorus: BYHRB]
Now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me

[Verse 2: BYHRB (Childish Gambino)]
Listen, you got a man, but your man ain't loyal
Don't understand how to spell it out for ya
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask why
Sorry, had to tell you I'm a nice guy
Naw, I'm a sick guy, money too much
I step on stage, and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, and you know it's true 'cause

[Bridge: BYHRB (Childish Gambino)]
Okay, G-A-M-B-I-N-O

But I know how you can get dude right back and get with me

Now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river (Want you to cry me)

Get so high
Go so fast
It's getting good
I wanna make it last
Spinning round
Soaring Free
Steady now your gonna make me scream
Adrenaline is rushing down
But light and sound is spinning round
Adrenaline is pouring out
You make me want to scream and shout
You got me going around in circles
Like a rollercoaster
You got me going around in circles

[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your **** bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do (huh)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told (huh)
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn (yeah)
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling (feeling...)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating

[Bridge]
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[Breakdown]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat

Fell in love with a real one, this a dedication (Wow)
Had 'em patiently waitin' for a revelation
even when I ain't around, ain't no separation
Your skin's smooth, your eyes brown and you're far from basic
Then we go to different places with no suitcases (Wow)
But when we come back, we got suitcases (Yeah)
Right now I use love for a medication (Love)
Back in the day I'd shoot Cupid with no hesitation (Bow, bow)
I got more than 40 acres for my reparations
Pussy on my navigation, that's my destination (Tell 'em)
Please don't never tell on me, baby (Never tell)
That mean don't call 12 on me, baby (Don't call 12)
As long as the meal prepared for me, baby (It's prepared)
The mills I prepare, I share with you, baby (Share)
Of course they gon' like this shit, look at it (Look)
everybody ain't happy, then look at me

Prayin' he make it home, I got used to it (Wow)
Prayin' he make it home like he used to (Wow, tell 'em, baby)

Watch me break it down like a foldin' chair
See me in the Chain Reactions, I got 40 pair

You know you're really something, yeah
How we get here so damn fast?
Only you can tell me that
Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back
You're making me forget my past
Never thought I'd feel like that again
I came to peace with my path
Now you got me off track

Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly

Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla Sign]
Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now, girl (Oh)
It's time for you to play your part now
You know we hit that jewelry store and we gon' ball out
Ups and downs, we had some fallouts (Ooh, yeah)
Put some ice on you, girl, let it thaw out (Ooh)
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
At the end of the day

Never let me run away, run away, my baby

525,600 minutes
525,000 moments so dear
525,600 minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?

In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
In 525,600 minutes
How do you measure a year in the life?

[Frankie Grande, Jon-erik Goldberg, Frankie & Ariana Grande]
How about love? (Love)
How about love? (Love)
How about love? (Love)
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love

[Frankie Grande]
525,600 minutes
525,000 journeys to plan
525,600 minutes
How do you measure the life of a woman or man?

In truths that she learned, or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned, or the way that she died

[All]
It's time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate, remember a year
In the life of friends

[All, Ariana Grande]
Remember the love
Oh, You got to, you got to remember the love
Remember the love
You know that love is a gift from up above
Remember the love
Share love, give love, spread love
Measure, measure your life in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Measure your life, measure your life in love

Diamonds good for my appetite
Guess it fuckin' just clicked one night
All them demons helped me see shit differently
So don't be sad for me

[Pre-Chorus]
How you been spending your time? (How?)
How you be using your tongue? (How?)
You be so worried 'bout mine (Mine)
Can't even get yourself none
You know you sound so dumb (So dumb, so dumb)
You know you sound so dumb (So dumb)

[Chorus]
So maybe you should shut up, mmm
Yeah, maybe you should shut up
Said if only you would shut up (Mmm)
Yeah, that's right, you should shut up (Ah)

[Verse 2]
I vibrate high and my circle lit
We ain't really with drugs and shit
Love the game so I ain't never miss
Keep opinions muted for the hell of it
'Cause I like my shit (Mmm, yep)


[Pre-Chorus]
How you been spending your time? (How?)
How you be using your tongue? (How?)
You be so worried 'bout mine (Mine)
Can't even get yourself none
You know you sound so dumb (So dumb, so dumb)
You know you sound so dumb (So dumb)

[Chorus]
So maybe you should shut up, mmm
Yeah, maybe you should shut up
Said if only you would shut up (Mmm)
Yeah, that's right, you should shut up (Ah)



[Vers 1]
Mijn aanwezigheid is zoet en mijn aura is helder
Diamanten zijn goed voor mijn eetlust
Blijkbaar klikte het op een nacht
Alle demonen hielpen mij om dingen anders te zien
Dus wees niet verdrietig voor mij

[Pre-refrein]
Hoe ben je je tijd aan het doorbrengen? (Hoe?)
Hoe ben je je tong aan het gebruiken? (Hoe?)
Je maakt je zoveel zorgen om mijne (Mijne)
Je kan niet eens iets voor jezelf krijgen
Je weet dat je zo dom klinkt (Zo dom, zo dom)
Je weet dat je zo dom klinkt (Zo dom)

[Refrein]
Dus misschien moet je je mond houden, mmm
Ja, misschien moet je je mond houden
Zeg, als je nou je mond zou houden (Mmm)
Ja, dat klopt, je moet je mond houden (Ah)

[Vers 2]
Ik vibreer hoog en mijn cirkel is gezellig
Wij doen niet echt aan drugs en shit
Ik hou van het spel dus ik mis nooit
Ik hou de meningen stil voor de lol
Want ik hou van mijn shit (Mmm, ja)

[Pre-refrein]
Hoe ben je je tijd aan het doorbrengen? (Hoe?)
Hoe ben je je tong aan het gebruiken? (Hoe?)
Je maakt je zoveel zorgen om mijne (Mijne)
Je kan niet eens iets voor jezelf krijgen
Je weet dat je zo dom klinkt (Zo dom, zo dom)
Je weet dat je zo dom klinkt (Zo dom)

[Refrein]
Dus misschien moet je je mond houden, mmm
Ja, misschien moet je je mond houden
Zeg, als je nou je mond zou houden (Mmm)
Ja, dat klopt, je moet je mond houden (Ah)

I know I be on some bullshit
Know I be driving you crazy
But I know you love how I whip it
You can only stay mad for a minute
So come here and give me some kisses
You know I'm very delicious
You know I'm very impatient
Might change my mind, so don't keep me waiting

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wonder, baby, if you're gonna stay
even if, one day, I lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy
I just wanna tell you directly
So, boy, let me know if you ready

[Chorus]
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down? Mmm


[Verse 2]
You know you be on some bullshit (Bullshit)
Act so possessive and crazy (Crazy)
But I know that's just 'cause you love me
And you ain't scared to show me your ugly
And maybe that's just how it's supposed to be
I'm the release, you the dopamine

[Verse 1]
Dear Santa, it's me, Ariana
I know it's been awhile but I really need your help this year
Let me make this clear
See I, I really love him and it's been kinda tough
Cause he's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flying away, away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need another gift, I just have one wish
This year can you...

[Chorus]
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California

[Verse 2]
Dear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away
See I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days
Can't you make his five o'clock flight delay?
Won't you find a way?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need another gift, I just have one wish, oh yeah
This year can you...

[Chorus]
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California

[Bridge]
I know I'm asking for the impossible, but I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me, so please, please

[Chorus]
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California


Snippet
Sober, when you come closer

La, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1]
I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
even if they're beautiful

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you

[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
even if they're beautiful

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It used to be easy
For someone to steal me
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you, boy

[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes, babe

[Bridge]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here

[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go (Oh, yeah, baby)
Not even sometimes
La, la, la, la, la, la, la (Ooh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Not even sometimes
La, la, la, la, la, la, la (Oh, yeah)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind (Baby)
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go (No, boy)
Not even sometimes

[Verse 1]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I've heard of
Once in a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

[Refrain 1]
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me, oh
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

[Refrain 2]
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I?

[Refrain 1]
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me, oh
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

[Refrain 2]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly, hmm
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I?

[Outro]
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why, can't I?

Let's rock to this music
Have the time of your life

[Pre-Chorus]
What you need, babe, is a number one

What you need, babe, is a number one

[Outro]
Don't be ashamed, any time, any place
Let him know that you got it like that




[Graham:]
There you come with your big, brown eyes and I'm so sure you got me mesmerized
So sure I'm just about to fall for you
But you don't even try and catch me, so I

[Ariana:]
I pick myself up, I pick myself up
Boy, you might be falling but I think I better not
My heart's still mine
I'm gonna take my time, but

[Both:]
Don't leave cause there's something about me and you

You gotta stick around, stick around around
Oh, You gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love, baby we've found
You gotta stick around

[Graham:]
Any other guy would fall at your feet
They think I'm crazy but they're nothing like me
I've always been the kind to think things out
And I'm kinda wondering what you're all about
So I

[Ariana:]
I make my mind up, I make my mind up
But boy, you gotta know that I'm not in a rush
I'm a fun girl not a dumb girl so
Wait a minute

[Both:]
Till I got you all figured out

You gotta stick around, stick around, around
Oh, you gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found
You gotta stick around

Take a look, take a breath
Take a chance on everything I've said
Take your heart. And take your time
And maybe one day you'll be mine
Ohh, maybe one day you'll be mine. (Woah)
Yeah!

You gotta stick around, stick around, round
Oh, you gotta hang round' if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found
Stick around, stick around, round
Oh, you gotta hand 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love, baby, real love, love baby we've found
You gotta stick around

There you come with your big brown eyes and I'm
So sure you've got me mesmerized
Stick around


[Spoken Intro: Ariana Grande]
ennui mon ami
I know the problem look colossal
But if you can see me
How bad can things be?

[Verse 1: Jim Carrey, Ariana Grande, Katrin Kiner]
What do you do
When the barrel that carries you
Suddenly harries you
Stick together
What do you do when the bolt in the wood parts
Turn into no good parts
Stick together

[Chorus: Jim Carrey & Katrin Kiner]
Stay, stay sag an droop an drag
An rivets wear an tearsome
But we can still repair some

[Spoken Interlude 1: Ariana Grande, Puppet]
Now you try
My oh my

[Verse 2: Puppet, Katrin Kiner, Jim Carrey]
What should you do when you stuck on the drain
You should sing this refrain, stick together
easy peasy bottle squeezy
Dingy dingy brushing fingy

[Spoken Interlude 2: Puppet Monster, Jim Carrey]
Now we pour a square
There there
Where?
There

[Verse 3: Bee Puppet, Ariana Grande, Jim Carrey. Katrin Kiner]
What should you do when your favorite comes
Needing repairs
Sing together
easy peasy bottle squeezy
Dingy dingy brushing fingy
Spiffy riffy, fix in jiffy

[Bridge: Ariana Grande, Bread Monsters]
Make mistakes
For heavens sakes
We all commit the past friends
Let's fix that [?] nose friend
[?]
And a whole lot of doing

[Outro: Kidding Cast, Ariana Grande, Both]
easy peasy bottle squeezy
easy peasy bottle squeezy
Dingy dingy brushy flingy
easy peasy bottle squeezy...
Dingy dingy brushy flingy...
What would we do when we're always
Apart of no fun
What would we do when we're always
Apart of no fun
We stick with glue on two by two
It's ten of one
Stick together, ten of one




[Verse 1]
Jamie is over and Jamie is gone
Jamie's decided it's time to move on
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon
And I'm still hurting

[Verse 2]
Jamie arrived at the end of the line
Jamie's convinced that the problems are mine
Jamie is probably feeling just fine
And I'm still hurting

[Chorus]
What about lies, Jamie?
What about things
That you swore to be true?
What about you, Jamie?
What about you?

[Verse 3]
Jamie is sure something wonderful died
Jamie decides it's his right to decide
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide
And I'm still hurting

[Verse 4]
Go and hide, run away
Run away, run and find something better
Go and ride the sun away
Run away like it's simple
Like it's right

[Violin & Piano Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Give me a day, Jamie
Bring back the lies
Hang them back on the wall
Maybe I'd see
How you could be
So certain that we
Had no chance at all

[Bridge]
Jamie is over and where can I turn?
Covered with scars I did nothing to earn
Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn

[Outro]
But that wouldn't change the fact
That wouldn't speed the time
Once the foundation's cracked
And I'm still hurting




[Intro]
Mmm
Hey, yeah

Still layin' in my bed, singin'

I was there in the rain
Crying again
You said that you changed,
But you're just the same

Now don't make it worse
By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes

Don't worry
I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
Boy you know you better be gone
(You better be gone)

Boy don't look so confused
Remember the truth
Now when I met you
You had nothing at all
I guess with true love
What mine is your's
And maybe it was
But it's not anymore

Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone

So we believed the one that loved
Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
The problem isn't mine

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone

You make me say oh (Sheesh), oh babe, yeah (Sheesh)
(Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it)
Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix, yeah
(Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it)
You make me say oh, oh

[Bridge: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
And then we lay it back, oh shit, talk the rest of the night, okay
Things that we can light make me say oh (Sheesh), oh (Sheesh)
Talking 'bout what you wanna do, whether it's wrong or right
I am followin' you, babe, yee, yeah
Ayy, said I don't know what I'd do without you in my life
It'd be so sour (Sweetener, hey)
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
Life deals us cards (Hey, oh)
everything tastes like it is salt (Sheesh, sheesh)
Then you come through like the sweetener you are (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
To bring the bitter taste to a halt (Hey, hey, hey)
(And then you) Ooh, baby

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
(Get it, get it, get it, get it) Yeah
(Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it) Shee
(Flip it, flip it, flip it)
You make me say oh (Sheesh), oh babe (Sheesh)
(Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it)
(Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it)
(Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it)
(You make me say oh) You make me say, oh

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
Ooh yeah
Uh, oh yeah
No, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Oh yeah, baby
Hey, yeah
Oh yeah, baby


[Hook: Ariana Grande]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Leon Thomas]
I've asked about you and they've told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know... we know
They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Ah, pushing me away so I give her space
Ah, dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

[Hook: Ariana Grande]

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande/Leon Thomas]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do... you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know... we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you.. instead they say:

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

[Outro]
Slow...
Take it slow...
Take it slow...
Take it slow...

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Baby boy, what's on your mind?
I be askin' all the time
Do I know? But please remind me
Why you never wanna talk to me?
Talk to me, talk to me
Boy, open up your mind for me, mind for me
Talk to me, talk to me
You don't even need to talk to me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You show me with your
Body, body, body, body, bae
Body, body, body
You show me with your
Body, body, body, body, bae
Body, body, body
You show me with your
Body, body, body, body, bae
Body, body, body
You show me with your body
You show me with your body

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Okay, I take your clothes off, your body so soft
I give it to you real, it's no drama, ain't a soap opera
Whisper in your ear a little bit, but never too much
It's on the hush, I'd rather tell you with the way that I touch
You, every inch of your skin
My fingertips are dancin' with you, you my ballerina
You do a split, I split the difference
Yeah, you love to talk, I love to listen
And girl, it's a promotion every time we change positions
Okay, I'm swimmin' inside your linen like it's a ocean
Let me mix you a potion
Let me shake the walls, put this in motion
Let me get you goin'
My ears is open when you speakin'
Yeah, we playin' hookie, stay in bed, but we ain't sleepin'
Ain't a need for leavin' ever
Time is relative, we spend it more than you can measure
Nothin' better, let me help relieve the pressure
This is pleasure
The whole universe align and everything will come together
If you let her

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You show me with your
Body, body, body, body, bae
Body, body, body
You show me with your
Body, body, body, body, bae
Body, body, body
You show me with your
Body, body, body, body, bae
Body, body, body
You show me with your body
You show me with your body

[Verse 1]
You don't need a lot of money
Honey, you don't have to play no games
All I need is all your lovin'
To get the blood rushing through my veins, oh
I wanna say we're going steady
Like it's 1954
No, it doesn't have to be forever
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart

[Verse 2]
You don't need to worry about making me crazy
'Cause I'm way past that, yeah
And so just call me if you want me, 'cause you got me
And I'll show you how much I want to be on your tattooed heart

Tattooed heart, tattooed heart

And lay me in your bed
And kiss me underneath the moonlight
Darling, let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart

Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart

Woo, yeah
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Oh, ooh
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart




[Verse 1]
I'm sick of fighting over money
I went back home to heal the pain
Late at night, I'd watch your stories
And feel the ice rushing through my veins (Fuck)
We were young, we weren't ready
MySpace, 2004
I always thought it'd be forever
So I went and got your name

[Chorus]
In a tattooed heart
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh yeah
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)

[Verse 2]
You don't need to worry about
If I go crazy, you won't be here for that
So just block me 'cause I blocked you
And then one day, I might show you
I covered up your name

[Chorus]
In this tattooed heart
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
I covered up your name
In this tattooed heart

[Bridge]
Wrapped up in my jacket, I'm lying
Face down in my bed
And tracing underneath the moonlight
A ghost left on my skin

[Chorus]
Of a tattooed heart
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
(Hey) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

A ghost left on my skin
Of a tattooed heart

London, y'all ready to slow it down for me?

And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing

Holding hands with my mama

Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Verse 1]
Thought l'd end up with one
Of the guys I grew up with
But then we grew apart
And now, it's like we're nothing
I was with someone younger
But he wasn't a match
Sometimes it doesn't work out
But I'm okay with that

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause one taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Like it's education
I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look where I've got
Look what it taught me

Now I put myself first
And that's not being selfish
I know that he'll do the same
'Cause we're still young and we're learning

[Pre-Chorus]
So he taught me love
I taught him patience
And we handle pain
Like it's motivation
We've loved and we've lost
But that's not what I see
Look where we've got
Look what it taught me

[Chorus]
I say thank you, next
Thank you, next

I'm so fuckin' grateful for my-
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you

[Bridge]
Sometimes I get so scared
Of being lonely
'Cause I depend on
So many people around me
But I hope in the end that I'll see clearer
I'lI be thanking myself
Looking into the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause she taught me love
She taught me patience
And she handles pain
Cause she's so amazing
She loved and she lost
But that's not what I see
Look where she got
Learning for searching

[Chorus]
I'll say thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my myself
Thank you, thank you
Thank you, next

No.

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ariana Grande]
You're tryna get familiar
With somebody I knew first
But she already know her worth
everything you don't deserved
We already know the truth
Send the screenshots and the proof
You don't even have the juice

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Njomza]
'Cause she... boy, that bitch is mine
(Boy, that bitch is mine, boy, that bitch is mine)
So please... boy, don't waste no time
Real one on my side

[Verse 2: Njomza]
I know you know we know 'bout you
Sorry, we ain't what you're normally used to
Prolly think you're comin' closer to me
Don't you think that she'd pick you over me
Boy, please
[Pre-Chorus 2: Njomza]
I got some advice
Next time you'll think twice
Bad bitch by my side
Always down to ride
We won't let this
Shit that you get back
Before you come 'round mine
Boy, make up your mind


[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Njomza]
'Cause she... boy, that bitch is mine
(Boy, that bitch is mine, boy, that bitch is mine)

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Njomza]
Told me hit him after eight o' clock
Told me you'd pick me up at 5
But let me guess, y'all went to ask the neighbors
Reservation at the Chateau (Right?)
You should pull up with me instead
That would really fuck with his head
And he really think that this shit's okay
Won't get away with another thing
[Bridge: Ariana Grande, Njomza & Both]
Ooh-oh, girl, this gon' be some shit
Ooh-oh, girl, we'd love to see it
Ooh-oh, won't get away with another thing
Ooh-oh, so, why don't you lay in this bed today?

Wow, that's just crazy



[Verse 1: Ariana, elizabeth]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Chorus: Ariana, elizabeth, Both]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly-y
And so I'm offering this simple phra-ay-ay-ase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Refrain: Ariana, elizabeth, Both]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Love, yeah, love
Love is the law, love is the only law
Love is the law, love is the only law, yeah
Love, yeah
Love is the law, love is the only law
You should, you should do thou wilt
You should...

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
See I was thumbin' through the mail, fishin' for a feed
To feed my female, A-S-A-P
Nature is a mother
And life is a bitch, I am convinced
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time (Ayy!)
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time (Ayy!)
Take your time, baby!

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I get the feelin' that you only playin' hard to get
'Cause you ain't forget how much I love a challenge
I know we were divided to restore the balance
Hope I still get you wet while you bendin' over backwards
Watchin' over me in ecstacy, expectin' me
Your number is 6 and 50 interestingly
I hope you're still blue, with golden ovaries
On your tippy toes for me, just how you 'posed to be
They spoke of us in Cairo quite some time ago
How these Adamines adapt to this is incredible
They love to go to sleep but hate to be awake
Treat the eye of Horus as if it's just a symbol
Unattainable, they read the wrong rights
They see the signs but ain't see what the sign saw
But luckily, uh, love is the only law, uh
Love is the, Love is the only...

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
See I was thumbin' through the mail, fishin' for a feed
To feed my female, A-S-A-P
Yeah, nature is a mother
And life is a bitch, I am convinced, yeah
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time, yeah
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time
Take your time, baby!

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Love, love
'Cause all my thoughts are lavender and pastel green
And you the only one that know what I mean
You know what I mean

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
And they say our separation was sacrificial and all
But I'm in awe
These hybrids gettin' high, but they don't get it at all
The pain of division is nothin'
The joy of disillusion is all, but all in all, man
I know you a modest Scarlet Woman
Like to say you everything but nothin'
But you nothin' but my everything
How shall I explain? Ayy, Mac

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
See I was thumbin' through the mail, fishin' for a feed
To feed my female, A-S-A-P
Yeah, nature is a mother
And life is a bitch, I am convinced, yeah
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time, yeah
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time
Take your time, baby!

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
Can't forget about the Queen

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Queens, we are noddin' back
Understand we are his back
And when he puts the arc in your back
Understand that we took him to Heaven
Where those golden arcs are at
Golden as sundrops, Queen
When he looks in your eyes
You show him where the stars are at
And your beautiful, beautiful darkness
And in return he replies that
"Girl, I'll be your knight, your knight in shining armor
'Cause you're my heart, Queen"
And lying on his chest our hearts beat box
And you and I are queens
We remind him that he can be all ours
'Cause we all gods
And God is Queen and God is love
And love stays above all
Heaven, stars, queen, God, God

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Love, love, love
Love is the law, love is the only law
Love is the only law, love

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Ayo, Bentley, remember that chick you brought by the studio?
You thought that was your woman, your woman
Ain't your woman, she's Soul's woman
It's love though, B, it's love, yeah

[Intro]
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead-
You wouldn't let anybody speak and instead-

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, trophy wife, out, you won me
Until you had to find out it's one me
No-now you benched, aww, your bum knee
Now I'm the bad guy, call me Chun-Li (Ooh)
'Cause you was slippin', yep, you clumsy
And everything I peeped, can't just unsee
Sips tea, and it's unsweet
Re-respect bad gyal when mi done speak (Now, now)
Now he shooting his shot like drive-by
Why-why-why you had to make me go call up my side guy?

[Verse 1]
So, nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
So where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
So deep in the cut, drowning in a pain
Somebody help, 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move

[Verse 2]
So somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
So where were you when I needed you the most?
Why in the hell would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
So now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heartless, broken mess




Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle
The cow jumped over that mole on your face
Moles just happen; they aren't your fault
But that little beauty is quite a disgrace

Hey, friend, you're still a good person
You wear your heart right on your sleeve, but
You have got to fix that
Or your friends will up and leave

There's no way you don't see it
I know your house ain't dark
And don't you kid yourself it's
It's not a beauty mark

Beauty marks are little and cute
Like Cat

It's really really gross when we're at the table
And I have to look at that ugly brown zit
every bite of my tuna sandwich
Makes me feel like I'm tasting it

So do yourself and your pals a favor
Have your doc fire up this laser
And aim it at that nasty beaut
Or all your friends will continue to puke
That means throw up


[Intro: Ariana Grande & Mac Miller]
What we gotta do right here is go back
Back into time
I love the way you make me feel (Okay)
I love it, I love it (Yeah)

Do she love me, do she love me not? (Love me not)

You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya
And I ain't going nowhere, 'cause you're a keeper
(Ke-ke-keeper...)

[Instrumental Drop]

[Verse]
You give me that kinda something
Want it all the time, need it every day (day, day, day...)
Scale of one to ten I'm at 100
Never get enough, I can't stay away (-way, -way, -way...)

[Pre-Drop]
If you want, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya
And I ain't going nowhere, 'cause you're a keeper
(Ke-ke-keeper...)

[Intro]
Mmmm, watch me
Hey, woo
One, two, three
Watch me

[Verse 1]
I walked over, got this sunlight
Ain't got time to listen to any shade, yeah
The wind on my pony, top-down, alright
Ain't got time to let them darken my day, that's right

[Pre-Chorus]
So light the fireworks
Sing like no one's hurt
Dance
It's us against the world

[Chorus]
Oh, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about us
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about what we do
Yeah, it's true
I could have all this, but I'm good if I got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about...
Mmmm, listen, watch me

[Verse 2]
You act so lonely
Catch that feeling
So hold onto it for as long as you can
We could run away to only where we know
Boy, I got plans
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
So light the fireworks
Sing like no one's hurt
Dance
It's us against the world

[Chorus]
Oh, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about us
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about what we do
Yeah, it's true
I could have all this, but I'm good if I got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about...

[Bridge]
Hey
They don't know about, they don't know about, about, about us
Light the fireworks
Let it catch fire
We gon' dance, dance 'til it hurts when we in the clubs
We 'bout to let 'em know, know who's your girl
So put your hand in my hand
It's you and me, it's us against the world
Sing it to me one more time
It's you and me, it's us against the world
Sing it to me one more time
It's you and me, it's us against the world
I'm tryna tell you, honey, it's us against the world

[Chorus]
Oh, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about us
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about what we do
Yeah, it's true
I could have all this, but I'm good if I got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about...
Mmmm, listen, watch me

[Outro]
(I walked over in the sunlight)
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about us
(Wind in my pony, top-down, alright)
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about what we do
Yeah, it's true, I could have all this, but I'm good if I got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about us




[Intro]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' bout you
Yeah, I've been missing you
Where the hell are you
Oh, when I need you?
I could still hear your voice
I ain't got no choice
'Cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

[Chorus]
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Got these thoughts in my head
Ain't no way to forget
Got me losing my breath
Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

[Chorus]
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (About you, baby)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you ('Bout you, ah)
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (I'm thinkin' 'bout you)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Say you don't, baby, 'bout you)

[Bridge]
Baby, I don't want no one, no one else
So hurry, 'cause I need some, need some, need some help
And I've been waiting patient, patiently
'Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me
But at least I have the memory

[Chorus]
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you ('Bout you)
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (I do)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh; Oh, yeah)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you ('Bout you, 'bout you, yeah)
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you

[Verse 1: Kate McKinnon & Aidy Bryant]
The world, it needs an anthem
For all of womankind
The song to fight, the song to right
The wrongs of all of time
So we put pen to paper
And wrote all through the night
A gorgeous ode to feminism
Well within our sights

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant]
But this is pretty nuanced stuff
And putting it all in one song was tough
And that's why...

[Chorus 1: All Women]
This is not a feminist song
We tried real hard but it took too long
This is not a feminist song
Cause we were scared we would do it wrong
We know women need an anthem
A song to call their own
But we didn't write that anthem
We went home

[Verse 2: Cecily Strong & Ariana Grande]
every woman has a struggle
And every struggle's real
But just try and write a song
That captures every woman's deal
So instead of writing lyrics
Here's us running in the sand
And here's a bunch of lens flares
And an old woman's hands

[Verse 3: Kate McKinnon & Leslie Jones]
Not to call a woman old
Or judge a woman's hands
We know a woman shouldn't be
Reduced to just her hands

[Pre-Chorus 2: Kate McKinnon and Ariana Grande]
We stepped right into that trap
It's so hard to navigate this crap
And that's why...

[Chorus 2: All Women]
This is not a feminist song
So technically, it can't be wrong
This is not a feminist song
I feel like we've been singing so long
Our ancestors, they fought for us
So they deserve a song
But this is not that song, so move along

[Bridge: Aidy Bryant & Sasheer Zamata]
Now here's some powerful footage
For a song, we did not write
It's Malala, Maya Angelou
And Madeleine Albright

[Bridge 2: Kate McKinnon & Ariana Grande]
And RBG, she taught me that women can be strong
And that women have the right to choose
To bail on this whole song, oh, yeah

[All Women]
And that's why
This is not a feminist song
We're just women singing a song
But doesn't that make it a feminist song?
I guess this was feminist all along

[Chorus 3: All Women (Beck Bennett)]
This is a feminist song
Tweet it, (hashtag "feminist song")
(Where are the men in this feminist song?)
An excellent point, now move along
Cause now it's time for you at home
To weigh in on this song
And tell us if we handled it all wrong

[Outro: Aidy Bryant & Ariana Grande]
This tough and tricky landmine of a song
Ah, yeah




[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
We're too young to die
So let's keep living 'til it all falls down
Let's close our eyes
And let the moment drown the whole world out

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you
This one's for you

[Drop: David Guetta]

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Waving colored flags
We won't surrender, there's no standing down
Love's a battlefield
It's full of winners, we're breaking new grounds

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you
This one's for you

[Drop: David Guetta]

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Oh yeah
Oooh
This one's for you
Woah

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you


(chorus:)
My regrets
Ain't no business
I'm on my way
What bout you ?
What i've been through
You don't have clue
But this time is the one
Yeah this time is the one

[Intro: Joji]
Searching for a reason why, oh
Searching where the leaves don't grow, grow, grow

[Verse: Joji]
Yo
The pitter-patter gave a rather rinse and lather feeling
As opposed to shitty attitudes that made me bitter after laughter
And I deeply regretted it
I take the D train to go to BK
I can't defeat rain

[Hook: Joji & Ariana Grande]
And as far as we go
And as far as we go
And how little we know
And how little we know
Searching for the weekend love
Searching where the leaves don't fall
When the land is widow (Oh)
Fall to the ground

[Refrain: Joji & Ariana Grande]
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
Speak to me
So bright
Speak to me
So bright

[Hook: Joji &  Ariana Grande]
And as far as we go (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
And as far as we go (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
When the land is widow (So)
Fall to the ground (So bright)

[Refrain: Joji, Ariana Grande]
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
(So bright)
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
So bright
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
So bright
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
(Some, some, somebody)
Please don't run away
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
(Some, some, somebody)
Please don't run away
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)

[Interlude: Ariana Grande]
A true friend of ours was talking on the phone


[Outro: Joji]
Please don't run away
Oh, please don't run away
Please don't run away
Oh, please don't run away



[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Seven billion people
Tryna free themselves
Said a billion prayers
Tryna save myself
I can see it coming
But it's moving fast

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Been through a hurricane
With the sunroof down
Dancing with no pain
We wait to see the sunrise
It's a holiday (Hey)
When you're around (When you're around)
Breath of fresh air like a cold winter breeze
And I can feel it slow down, oh

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time

[Post-Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Oh, time, time, yeah

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Running after something
But I don't know what
Am I running to?
Too afraid to stop
Hundred miles an hour
With no seatbelt on
Time is everlasting
I can't wait that long (Ooh)

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams (All the stars)
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems (This whole world)
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow (Ooh)
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time

[Verse 4: Ariana Grande]
My feet are falling to the bottom of the ocean
Running out of time, out of time, uh, oh yeah
High on emotion, I can feel it moving forward
Running out of time, running out
Running out, running out of time

[Chorus: Brent Jones & The Best Life Singers]
Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams (All the stars)
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems (This whole world)
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow (Ooh)
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
(Time)
(Time)
Uh
It's about power (Time)
All about power (Time)
Oh, I'm in time
I'm just tryna feel it (Time)
Get a little bit stronger
Gotta go all out (Time)
A nigga gon' ball out
Try not to fall out
Tryna be better
Gotta get better (Time)
Too many pressure
Nigga need pressure
People need pressure
Uh, woo

[Outro]
Running out of time
We're running
Running out of time (Woah)
We're running
Running out of time
We're running


Through just about the craziest storms and whirlwinds I can imagine, Ariana Grande remains the most real person I've met. I've always thought the world is privy to actual, genuine emotion-be it heartbreak, empathy, generosity, resilience, strength-and I believe that's exactly why the world keeps falling deeper in love with Ariana. Wearing her heart on her sleeve and in her work, she oozes those emotions in abundance. Armed with a full comprehension of how the world consumes music today, she is an industry game changer. Having released not one but two critically acclaimed, record-breaking albums just a few months apart-the latter, Thank U, Next, was written in just a few weeks-Ari is breaking the rules and is a force who understands how music should work in 2019. Her love of her fans and of music guide her every move. But my favorite moments with Ari are the quieter ones. When I, like so many, have been inspired by that resilience, love, care and heart in someone I'm lucky to call my friend.

Now she's the biggest artist in the world, and that's kind of a no-brainer to me. I can't wait to see what she does next.



[Intro]
I want you (Oh)
I want you (Oh)

[Verse 1]
You know what I want
I know what you don't
I should be the one you love on
Boy, you got my mind playing truth or dare
Daring me kiss you right here

[Pre-Chorus]
But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show
I-woah-woah-woah

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me, and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close

[Verse 2]
Remember that girl that you used to date?
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great
So, what would you do?
What would you say if I said I loved you that way?

[Pre-Chorus]
But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show, oh

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?

Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close

All my ladies, make noise

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close
Oh, I want you, oh, I want you, oh, I want you

[Verse 1]
How do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? (Hmm)
When you're not really there? (Hey, yeah, mm)
How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in?
Ah, yeah, baby, just come on in (Hmm, yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

[Verse 2]
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? (Oh-oh)
Baby, let's just forget (No-oh)
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's fall in love, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
On that first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me, please, and never let me go
On that second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me that promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
On that third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said "I love you" and meant it, oh
On the fourth, we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

[Chorus]
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh-oh, ah-ah, ah-ah
You are my true love

[Verse 2]
On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wishlist
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got that tattoo on my heart
'Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star
Ain't nothin' shining more than you, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million, oh-oh
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

[Chorus]
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love
You are my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
(You are my true love)
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh-oh, ah-ah, ah-ah
You are my true love


(Verse 1:Jaxon C)
Will you kiss my head under the willow tree?
I keep thinking about what happened yesterday between us
But how am i supposed to think?
With you on my little mind
(Pre Chorus:Jaxon C)
I thought we would be great to work with each other
I guess i was wrong from the start about you and your family
We will just wait and see how much i really miss you oh yeah
(Chorus:Jaxon C)
Come watch the bright beautiful universe
We will not come if your not bright or beautiful
Im just saying that we need to get out of the house
Come watch the bright beautiful universe
(Verse 2:Jaxon C)
How in the world did you do that (i said world)
Let me see you get that ice baby
Yo i don't care what you say ima bust it out anyways
And all you dumb little hoes keep bugging me about this and that
(Chorus:Jaxon C)
Come watch the bright beautiful universe
We will not come if your not bright or beautiful
Im just saying that we need to get out of the house
Come watch the bright beautiful universe
(Verse 3)
I watch from the sky as if i was flying
You were my pashion but now all i do is fashion
I thought i could trust you with my heart but no
I don't want to make the same mistake i did like last time
See im better off without you
[Bridge]
My eyes are glued on the universe

Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart, then tell me
Why are you still so afraid?

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
You've got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day

But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you get old
You're gonna kick off before you even
Get halfway through
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you

Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be
Before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight
Tonight
Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know
You can't always see when you're right. you're right


You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get half through
Why don't you realize, Vienna waits for you
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

[Verse 1]
I wanna mix a potion up
Make a special drink for you
Mmm-mmm
Just a little sip
And you're never gonna know what hit you, yeah, when I'm through
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now I'm not talking 'bout movies
Don't need no happy end

And if you try to leave me, I'll lock you in my trunk

[Chorus]
I'm gonna witch you
I'll stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting

The time is running
I am out of my mind
I have to destroy what i keep inside

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna think too much
I just wanna feel
You know that it ain't no rush

There's more love if you follow emotions
Show up, now if you're down to roll up
Meet me on the west side for me
Hold up, there shouldn't be no hold up
There's more love if you follow emotions
Show up, now if you're down to roll up
Meet me

[Verse 2]
I don't want it if it ain't your touch
It's better every time we chill

We got all we need right here
Just let me be in your life like that
Be your wife like that
I'll bring the light right back
I'll bring the life right back

Song by ariana grande


[Verse 1]
It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

[Verse 2]
Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No, no, no, downtown)
even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out
Ain't no ice or no chills
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things


[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

[Bridge]
Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside
even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

Once I was a selfish fool who never understood
Never looked inside myself, though on the outside, I looked good!
Then we met and you made me the man I am today
Tracy, I'm in love with you, no matter what you weigh, 'cause

Without love, life is like the seasons with no summer
Without love, life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer
Tracy, I'll be yours forever 'cause I never wanna be without love

Tracy, never set me free, no, I ain't lyin'
Never set me free, Tracy, no, no, no

[TRACY]
Once I was a simple girl, then stardom came to me
But I was still a nothing, though a thousand fans may disagree

[eNSeMBLe]
Tracy!

[TRACY]
Fame was just a prison, signing autographs a bore
I didn't have a clue 'til you came banging on my door

Now without love, life is like my dad without his bromo
Without love, life is making out withto Perry Como
Darling, I'll be yours forever 'cause I never wanna be without love


So darling, throw away the key, I'm yours forever
Throw away the key, yeah, yeah, yeah

[SeAWeeD]
Living in the ghetto, black is everywhere ya go
Who'd've thought I'd love a girl with skin as white as winter's snow?

[PeNNY]
In my ivory tower, life was just a hostess snack
But now I've tasted chocolate and I'm never going back

[PeNNY & SeAWeeD]
'Cause without love

[SeAWeeD]
Life is like a beat that you can't follow

[PeNNY & SeAWeeD]
Without love

[PeNNY]
Life is Doris Day at the Apollo

[PeNNY & SeAWeeD]
Darling, I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be


[PeNNY]
Without love

[SeAWeeD]
So darling, never set me free

[PeNNY & SeAWeeD]
I'm yours forever, never set me free, no, no, no

[LINK]
If you're locked up in this prison, Trace, I don't know what I'll do

[TRACY]
Link, I've got to break out, so that I can get my hands on you

[SeAWeeD]
And girl, if I can't touch you now, I'm gonna lose control

[PeNNY]
Seaweed, you're my black white knight, I've found my blue-eyed soul

[ALL]
Sweet freedom is our goal

[LINK]
Trace, I wanna kiss ya!


[TRACY]
Then I can't wait for parole!

[eNSeMBLe]
'Cause without love

[SeAWeeD]
Life is like a prom that won't invite us

[eNSeMBLe]
'Cause without love

[LINK]
It's like getting my big break and laryngitis

[eNSeMBLe]
'Cause without love

[PeNNY]
Life's a '45' when you can't buy it without love

[eNSeMBLe]
'Cause without love

[TRACY]
Life is like my mother on a diet!

[ALL]
Like a week that's only Mondays
Only ice cream, never sundaes
Like a circle with no center
Like a door marked, 'Do Not enter'

Darling, I'll be yours forever, 'cause I never wanna be without love

[PeNNY]
Yes, now you've captured me

[eNSeMBLe]
Without love

[TRACY & SeAWeeD]
I surrender happily

[eNSeMBLe]
Without love

[PeNNY]
Oh Seaweed, never set me free, no, no, no

[TRACY & LINK]
No, I ain't lyin'

[PeNNY & SeAWeeD]
Never set me free, no, no, no

[PeNNY]
No, I don't wanna live without love, love, love

[ALL]
Darling, you had best believe me
Never leave me without love



[Verse 1]
Come and kiss me, baby
We don't need no mistletoe, hmm
We don't need no fireplace
Boy, I'll keep you nice and warm, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play
'Tis the season for some love giving
So I think you should give your love to me
Baby, let me know

[Chorus]
Are you wit it?
Are you wit it?
Are you wit it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know)
Are you wit it?
Are you wit it?
Are you wit it this Christmas?

[Verse 2]
We don't need no presents
We don't need that kitchen
We don't need them recipes
You know I'm tasty like a candy cane or gingerbread
I'm made with love

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play
'Tis the season for some love giving
So I think you should give your love to me
Baby, let me know

[Chorus]
Are you wit it?
Are you wit it?

[Verse 1]
Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no

[Pre-Chorus]
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

[Chorus]
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

[Verse 2]
The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no


[Pre-Chorus]
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

[Chorus]
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me

[Bridge]
The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming

[Breakdown]
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea

[Chorus]
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, you don't know me
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, but there is just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love


[Outro]
My love



[Verse 1: Kristin Chenoweth]
You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

[Chorus 1: Kristin Chenoweth]
Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down 'cause I'll never stay

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you

[Post-Chorus: Kristin Chenoweth, Ariana Grande & Both]
I'm young (I'm young), and I love to be young
I'm free, baby, and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please

[Chorus: Kristin Chenoweth, Ariana Grande & Both]
I don't tell you what to say
Oh, I don't tell you what to do, baby
So please let me be myself
That's all I ask of you

[Post-Chorus: Kristin Chenoweth, Ariana Grande & Both]
I'm young, and I love to be young
Oh, I'm free, and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please

[Outro: Ariana Grande, Kristin Chenoweth & Both]
No, you don't own me (No, you don't own me)
You don't own me (No, you don't own me)
You don't own me
You don't, you don't, you don't
You don't own me
You don't own me (No, you don't own me)
No, you don't own me (No, you don't own me)
You don't own me
You don't, you don't, you don't
You don't own me


[Verse 1]
Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
Don't get mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but...

[Chorus]
You will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (Oh-oh)
Your way back then
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know


[Verse 2]
Now it's probably hard for you to hear
But there's nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands, boy, but you don't understand
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but...

[Chorus]
You will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown) (Oh-oh)
Your way back then
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know
You'll never know
Boy, you should've told me, told me
You'll never know
Boy, you should've let me know
You'll never know
Boy, you could've been there for me
But now you'll never know, you'll never know


[Bridge]
It's not my fault
You're a little bit too late
You're the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times
But none of that will change my mind, boy
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back, uh-uh

[Chorus]
You will never know what we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown)
Your way back then (Way back then, baby)
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know (Oh, baby)
You'll never know
Boy, you should've told me, told me
You'll never know
Boy, you should've let me know
You'll never know
Boy, you could've been there for me
But now you'll never know, you'll never know

[Outro]
You'll never know (You will never know, you will never know)
You'll never know (No)
You'll never know (You will never know)

[Verse]
Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
Don't be mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place, sing

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you woulda manned up
Put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt
Then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, boy

[Chorus]
What we could have been
If you would've shown your way back then, yeah
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
But you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know

Boy, you could've let me know
(You'll never know)
Boy, you could've been there for me
Now you'll never know, you'll never know, yeah

[Intro: Iyaz}
Ariana, Iyaz

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande & (Iyaz)]
Last night was crazy and today it's setting in
Did you really mean it, and could you say it again?
Oh-oh, even if you just say it over the phone
(Come on, and ring, ring, ring, yeah)
Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid (yeah)
But I'll take a chance on us
And hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee
I'm the only girl you see
Whatcha you say, boy?

[Chorus: Iyaz & (Ariana Grande)]
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh)
Girl, it's only you, (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)


[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
every day and night you've got an open invitation, (whoa)
As long as I'm your one and only destination
Fly with me
I'll be your fantasy, (woo)
You're in demand, but baby, baby, so am I
But if you're weak and try to sneak
I'll have to tell you "bye, bye"
I'm a put you on the spot
Am I your only girl or not?
What you say, boy?
(Woo)

[Chorus: Iyaz & (Ariana Grande)]
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only?)
You're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only
(Am I your only?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh)
Girl, it's only you, (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)


[Verse 3: Iyaz & (Ariana Grande)]
See, yeah, back in the day, I was trapped in a daze
Trying to run game, but I've actually changed (same old)
When I see you passing, the passionate flames
Simple interaction is all that I crave (oh)
I don't need to bring in all the attention (hey, yeah)
Girl, I need you, your love and affection
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention?

[Chorus: Iyaz & (Ariana Grande)]
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Baby, come clean)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh)
Girl, it's only you, (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)
I'm telling you the truth, (oh)
Girl, it's only you, (whoa)
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty
(Am I your only shorty?)


[Outro: Ariana Grande & (Iyaz)]
Am I your only?
Am I your only?
(Yeah)
Tell me, am I your only shawty?
(Yes, you are)
Why won't you say that?
(Yes, you are)
Am I your only shawty?

Well, you got a turtle
Up there in your room
But that poor little turtle man
He almost faced his doom

So your turtle got up
And walked out the door
He crawled to your lawn
But he ain't there no more

'Cause you see a bird
Flying way overhead
Well, it picked up your little turtle now
And made it fitting dead(?)

Oh, but your turtle
That bird just dropped him on a roof
Your neighbor's roof to be exact

I say that poor reptile
Turtles are reptiles, that's a fact

So go tell your dad
Or maybe your mom
To fetch a ladder
Or borrow one from Tom


Assuming you know
A dude named Tom
Although it would be kind of weird if you
Don't know a single Tom!

Just get your turtle
And give him a nice kiss on his shell
Give a little smooch to your green fella
But then go wash your lips 'cause
You could get salmonella
Salmonella's a bacteria
Whoa. (Whoa)

[Intro]
Hercules
Hercules

[Verse 1]
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that

[Verse 2]
When he smiled, the girls went wild with ("oohs" and "aahs")
And they slapped his face on every vase, on every "vahse"
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?


[Verse 3]
Say amen, there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains and spunk
From zero to hero, major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?

[Verse 4]
Who put the glad in gladiator?
(Hercules!)
Whose daring deeds are great theatre?
(Hercules!)
Is he bold?
Is he sweet?
My favorite flavor!

[Verse 5]
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Her-, her-
(Hercules, Hercules)
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high, (and the nicest guy)
Not conceited
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes, indeed
