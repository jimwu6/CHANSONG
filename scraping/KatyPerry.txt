[Verse 1]
Waking up next to you in the middle of the week
Never needed anyone to send me off to sleep
And I know I said go slow, but I can't hold back no more
Got a premonition this ain't gonna be a fling
You make the weekend feel like a year
Baby, you got me changing
24/7, I want you here
I hope you feel the same thing

[Chorus]
I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night
Tuesday night, every night
Are you gonna be the one that's on my mind?
3-6-5, all the time
I want you to be the one to stay
And give me the night and day

[Verse 2]
Love it when you come back and can't take it when you leave
Got me fantasizing our initials already
And I wanna just let go, falling deeper than before
Say that you are ready, lock it up in a heartbeat

[Chorus]
I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night

[Intro]
(Sha, sha, sha)

[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't say this, but at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standin' in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Verse 2]
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear, clear)
Oh, I'm not comin' back
You're taking seven steps here


[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Bridge]
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like

[Chorus]
The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you


[Outro]
(Sha, sha)
You do, oh
Ooh, ooh (La, la, la)
Ooh, ooh



[Verse 1]
Hello, I think this earth is a little boat
A but no
I left you by the toxical ways
Cause my ego isn't so wavey
[Chorus]
All and every time
Oh

Loved
I think you think its about everyone else
Your really fucking rude
Hell

I think you don't know your rude as hell
You know your the demon rebel
[Verse 2]
I'm sick of you
Trying to find my persona
Sickening animal
National Institute of the Language
Distracted by Mastodon
Down by you

Love that your movement isn't attracted
Hot blyss
And twenty times

All and every time

[Katy Perry: Verse 3]
Not trying to be rude
Just trying to be true
Got the pills and potions
Economic Crisis
Darker like your Biting
Fucking rude that your nails is biting
Find Out what you hate
Junk food for live
I would hate too say this
[Yolpoppy: Chorus]
All and every time
Oh

Loved
I think you think its about everyone else

You know your the demon rebel




[Verse 1]
I'm thirty-something going on thirteen
Still a sponge to everything
Saucer eyes wide, yeah, I still believe
And a sparkle in my steps
Smiling with my teeth

[Pre-Chorus]
They say that I might lose my Midas touch
They also say I may become irrelevant
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

[Chorus]
I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

[Verse 2]
So, I recommend that you lose your mind
It was the only thing that was keeping me behind

[Pre-Chorus]
They say curb your curiosity
They also say prepare to amend your dreams
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

[Chorus]
'Cause I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age (c'mon)
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

[Bridge]
How old would you be? Yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know, yeah
How old you really were?
How old would you be? Yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know (Know)
How old you really were?
(Hey!)

[Chorus]
I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

[Outro]
Oh-oh, I won't act my age
Ooh, yeah, ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh
I won't act my age


[Verse 1]
I take these turns a bit too fast
Trying to leave you in my past
The CD skips our favorite songs
Our greatest hits just don't belong
I really love to hate this
Love hate, hate love relationships

[Pre-Chorus]
Are overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for another chance to do this over again

[Chorus]
So this is it?
After all we've been through
We called it quits
And I'm about to
I lost my grip
On what little I had left
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose


[Verse 2]
I pop these pills like cracker jacks
And the prize, the glazed eyes
Just watching you react
When you're depressed you sleep too much
I'm not sure if I'm waking up

[Pre-Chorus]
It's overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for another chance to do this over again

[Chorus]
So this is it?
After all we've been through
We called it quits
And I'm about to
I lost my grip
On what little I had left
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose


[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close

[Outro]
I stood in line without you, oh
I stood in line without you, I, I-I-I-I
I stood in line
(I stood in line without you and I don't tell you what they ever thought)
I stood in line without you (About you)
I stood in line without you (Well without you)
I stood in line without you (Is everything I've got)
(I stood in line without you and I don't tell you all they ever thought about you)
And only, only ever thought about your pretty face
(Well, without you is everything I've got)
(I stood in line without you)



[Verse 1]
You hate the sand between your toes
I like the beach on a sunny day
I like pink margaritas
It appears you like beer
I like a foreign accent
You just say "What? What the hell they say?"
We got different perspectives
Night and day, but that's okay

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'd like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
You like to fight in silence
I like to scream while I'm breaking plates
You like the heavy metal
But I like songs to sing along to

[Chorus]
Sometimes I like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Bridge]
And I will, but you won't
And I do, but, but you don't
We won't budge either way
But we like it, we like it

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'd like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(Let's agree to disagree)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I bought him a drink before he could get away
And in the morning, sewed his jeans
They look better on me anyway
Yeah, I got the beauty but I got the brains
So don't play with me, boy
'Cause I'll beat you at you're own game

[Chorus: Jadyn Maria]
It's a man's world, but I'm the type of girl

It won't even phase me 'cause I'm that kind of lady
It's a man's world, but I'm the type of girl
Really doesn't matter 'cause I can do it better

Know where I'm going, don't need directions
Sit back, boy, I'll teach you a lesson
I'ma kiss you first, don't need your permission
'Cause girls like me break the tradition

[Chorus: Jadyn Maria]
It's a man's world, but I'm the type of girl (Type of girl)
Really doesn't matter 'cause I can do it better
In a man's world, but I'm the type of girl (Type of girl)

I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it

[Verse 1]
Can't go with the flow, got to make waves
Even though I look at the sand, and I'm just one grain
But my intuition says there's a bigger mission I must embrace
So I'm, I'm pushing my thoughts to a new place

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving
I'm just another robot
Taking up oxygen

[Chorus]
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening

[Verse 2]
So I'll speak my truth though my voice shakes (I can see it)
Try to summon the strength to look fear in the face

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving
I'm just another robot
Taking up oxygen

[Chorus]
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control (out of control)
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening

[Interlude]
Happening (Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
Happen, I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening (Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
Happen, I can see it happening
I can see it, I can see it, I can see it happening

[Chorus]
It's something bigger than me
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control (Out of control)
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening

[Outro]
Happening (I can feel it)
Happen, (I can see it) I can see it happening

Happen, I can see it




The story we paint is the wish of a dream
A hard journey traced by hope
How the alignment of the stars
My heart longs for something that couldn't stay
A true lover of the future burned in the sand

Like a scene where I just saw it in my dreams
Birds fly to the ocean
Just as we are genuinely free
My heart keeps beating
As the waves break
And the winds carry
All the memories that make me return to you


I heard you're feeling nothing's going right
Why don't you let me stop by
The clock is ticking, running out of time
So we should party, all night
So cover your eyes, I have a surprise
I hope you got a healthy appetite

If you wanna dance, if you want it all
You know that I'm the girl that you should call

But when you're with me
I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday everyday
I know you like it sweet
So you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

So make a wish

I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate

Pop your confetti

So hot and heavy
Till dawn
I got you spinning
Like a disco ball
I'll have them playing
Your song


We're living the life
We're doing it right
You're never gonna be unsatisfied
If you wanna dance
If you want it all
You know I'm the girl that you should call

[Verse 1]
If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

[Chorus]
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

[Verse 2]
I look up into the night sky
I see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real


[Verse 2]
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh-oh, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold



[Chorus: Rita Ora]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

[Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby
(Black, black widow, baby)

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

[Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)

Yeah, I kissed a snake
Now my hourglass shape's gonna seal your fate

But this is the web, web that you weaved
So, baby, now rest in peace

Oh, little did you know

Ooh, can you feel the sting?

Now you're stuck with me
'Cause you fucked with me

Gotta hit up Miss Grace Jones with that strange
Serving looks to these hoes, baby it's an antree
Hanging in the hills with Cavallari
Got the whole lane for me to carry just like Mariah
Kings of Leon, you know our sex is on fire
Bon Appetit, JG Trigga, Katy Perry

[Verse 1]
I was living in a small mind
With no lifeline
And no messages can reach me from the outside
When I looked out over the horizon
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising

[Verse 2]
Then it hit me
Maybe bit me
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me
I didn't know exactly where I would be going
But I had to let this river in me flowing

[Bridge]
What a ride
When you open your eyes
For the very first time
A real surprise

[Chorus]
I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water, every moment I'm alive


[Verse 3]
I was living on a fault line
The fault was all mine
And this unstable ground found me down half the time
But I had enough
I had to get up
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff

[Verse 4]
Then it hit me
You won't permit me
To be an individual
Just doesn't fit me
But I decided that it's going to be living
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison

[Pre-Chorus]
What a high
When you open your mind for the very first time
A real surprise

[Chorus]
I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water, every moment I'm alive


[Verse 5]
So long conformity
And ambiguity is a new priority
All it takes, for heaven sakes
Is to figure out the face and learn to separate

[Chorus]
I started living outside of the box
Taking my time when I always used to rush
Living outside of the box
Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I broke down the walls for my liberation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

[Bridge]
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside
Ha ha ha
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation

[Outro]
Oh, living outside of the box
Of the box, of your life
Of everything that seems nice
Oh, living outside of the box



[Verse 1]
Every week's the same
Stuck in school's so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at 8AM's crazy
Tired of being told what to do
So unfair, so uncool

We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good to let go, oh-oh (Go, oh-oh)

Hanging out's just something we like to do
My friends and the mess we get into

We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh (Go, oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
The weight of my words
Are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves, but you won't hear a thing
'Cause I've dug myself deep
I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In one ear and out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me

[Chorus]
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us

[Verse 2]
And it feels like you're in China
And I am in Peru
Whenever I am sleeping next to you, oh
We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh, boy can't you just get used to something so right?


[Pre-Chorus 2]
And sure I confess
I'm a mess, I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten before you go and throw it all away

[Chorus]
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us

[Bridge]
'Cause if you give up
Then what am I supposed to do?
All of our dreams never will come true without you

[Final Chorus]
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, baby, don't give up on this love



[Verse 1]
I wear the red shoes with the holes
To remind me what we went through
Sit down here, kick 'em off enough
I've not had enough of you
I tell you, "You know the car you drive
Keeps breaking down and never starts"
Next thing, I'm pulling up to you
We're in the backseat, driving it home
No one wants to be alone

[Chorus]
What do you do?
What do you do when everything is broken?
What do you say?
What do you say when no words fit the moment?
'Cause you're not here
And even if you were, all I could say is
What do I do? What do I do?
We're broken, but I can't throw us away

[Verse 2]
The video of our vacation's
Chewed up in the drawer beside me
She thinks I never got to watch it
I'm so glad I made a copy
The sky got bitter twisted
Just like you and me, I miss it
You snap it, bend it, burn it
Then you find that you can't fix it
Fall back on whatever still remains

[Chorus]
What do you do?
What do you do when everything is broken?
What do you say?
What do you say when no words fit the moment?
'Cause you're not here
And even if you were, all I could say is
What do I do? What do I do?
We're broken, but I can't throw us away

[Bridge]
Breaking you in, breaking your heart
I was taking it all and I tore you apart
Breaking me in, breaking my heart
And the damage was done
But I took what you got
We were breakin' it, smashin' it
Takin' it, lovin' it, hatin' it
Drivin' it home
And now I'm all, now I'm all alone

[Breakdown]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, what do you do?
Oh, what do you do?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
What do you do?
What do you do when everything is broken?
What do you say?
What do you say when no words fit the moment?
'Cause you're not here
And even if you were, all I could say is
What do I do? What do I do?
We're broken, but I can't throw us away


[Verse 1]
I wear the red shoes
With the holes
To remind me
What we went through
Sit down here
Kick 'em off enough
Not had enough of you
I tell you
You know
The car you drive
Keeps breaking down
And never starts
Next thing
I'm pulling up to you
We're in the backseat
Driving it home
No one wants
To be alone

[Chorus]
What do you do?
What do you do
When everything
Is broken?
What do you say?
What do you say
When no words
Fit the moment?
'Cuz you're not here
And even if you were
All I could say
Is what do I do?
What do I do?
We're broken
But I can't
Throw us away


[Verse 2]

Breaking you in
Breaking your heart
I was taking it all
And I tore you apart
Breaking me in
Breaking my heart

But I took what you got
We were breaking' it
Smashing' it
Taking' it
Loving' it
Hating' it
Driving' it home
And now I'm all
Now I'm all alone


[Bridge]
Oh, yeah [4x]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What do I do?
We're broken
But I can't
Throw us away

[Verse 1]
My mama warned me about boys like you
It's the reason I wear these steel toed boots, yeah
And let me give you a little piece of advice
My papa packs heat and he won't think twice, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Too much trouble better stay away
Grab your hat, better get gone
But if you stay, you've been warned

[Chorus]
I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!

Cause I'm the kinda girl that you wanna show off
I'll tell 'em all your friends with a southern drawl (yeah)


[Verse 4]
Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Sweet as a peach, impossible to tame
Fingers on the trigger and you'll be to blame

Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!
I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for you heart (yeah)

Leaving lovers in the dust every city
'Cause my heart was like a ghost town baby
And now I've met a man that breaks me

[Bridge]
My mama warned me about boys like you
It's the reason I wear these steel toed boots

My mama warned me about boys like you
It's the reason I wear these high heeled boots, yeah
And let me give you a little piece of advice
My papa packs heat and he won't think twice, yeah
Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Too much trouble, better stay away
Grab your hat, better get gone
But if you stay, you've been warned

[Chorus]
I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start
I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (yeah)
It's gonna leave a mark
Be careful what you wish for
You get what you see
Is that a gun in your pocket
Or are you just happy to see me?
I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (Yeah)
Be careful what you start

[Verse 2]
Well, every now and then I make a man break a sweat

[Verse 1]
Was 27, surviving my return of Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets, locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty, so out of gas

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Thought I wasn't enough
Found I wasn't so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn't take it anymore

[Chorus]
By the grace of God (There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

[Verse 2]
I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
Oh, I can finally see myself again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know I am enough, possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free

[Chorus]
By the grace of God (There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out

[Bridge]
Oh, that way, no
That way, no
Not in the name of love (In the name of love)
That way, no
That way, no
I am not giving up

[Breakdown]
By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror (Looked in the mirror)
Looked in the mirror (Looked in the mirror)

[Chorus]
By the grace of God (By the grace of God)
(There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (Picked myself back up)
(I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I (In front of the other)
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the
Golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love, oh oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up

Let's take a journey
Greetings, loved ones
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Let's take a journey
(Put your hands up)

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry & (Snoop Dogg)]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock

I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
(Uh!) The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on

Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Bridge: Skip Marley]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our life through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Bridge: Skip Marley]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

[Intro]
(Uh)

[Verse 1]
I wanna see you soon as I wipe the crust from my eyes
'Til the day I die, could you be the love of my life?
I'm a soldier for you, baby, I earned all my stripes, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Make-ups to the breakups
Times we coulda gave up
We put the dirty work in
So now we know it's worth it
Now we're celebrating
I'm so glad we made it this far, ah (Uh)

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, all we got
Are champagne problems now
'Cause, baby, all we got
Are champagne problems now (Woo)

'Til the day I die, could you be the love of my life?
I'm a baller for you, baby, I pay any price, ah


[Pre-Chorus]
Make-ups to the breakups
Times we coulda gave up
We put the dirty work in
Became a better version
Now we're celebrating
I'm so glad we made it this far
We both know the hardest part is over
Pull me closer, pour a drink (Uh)

[Verse 1]
You are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tiptoe through your triggered mind
You fight me, but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing

[Chorus]
Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore

[Verse 2]
I've tried to pick off your red flags
While dancing on broken glass
Your mind games hit like grenades
Feel cursed, just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees
Defeated, now retreating


[Pre-Chorus]
Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing

[Chorus]
Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
No, I am not fighting anymore

[Bridge]
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
I don't wanna fight no more, anyway, anyway
I am not fighting anymore


[Chorus]
(If you wanna go, then go) Choose your battles, babe
(If you wanna stay, then stay) Then you'll win the war
('Cause I don't wanna fight no more) Stop digging your own grave
(Baby, baby) When there's so much to live for
(If you wanna go, then go) Choose your battles, babe
(If you wanna stay, then stay) 'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
(I don't wanna fight no more, anyway, anyway)
I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go




[Verse 1]
"This is the last time," you say
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday
Nothing to celebrate
You give a hundred reasons why
And say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Thought that I was the exception
I could reroute your addiction
You could've been the greatest
But you'd rather get wasted

[Chorus]
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

[Verse 2]
You say it helps you write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You become what you despise
A stereotype-type-type-type
You think you're so rock and roll
But you're really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you fuckin' cho-o-o-oked

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Should've been my teammate
Could've changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won't remember in the morning

[Chorus]
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

[Bridge]
(Nine, one, one)
(Nine, one, one)
(Nine, one, one)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
(I'm not stickin' around, I'm not stickin' around)
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain

[Outro]
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
(You're goin' down, you're goin' down)
(You're goin' down, you're goin' down, I know)
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down


[Instrumental : Resident Evil Theme]

[Verse 1 Instrumental : Chalk Outline; Vocals : Harder to breathe]

How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Verse 2 Instrumental : Chalk Outline; Vocals : Chalk Outline & (E.T.) ]

You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain to
Wash away ( Ta-ta-take me )
Wash away ( Ready for abduction )
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway
All you left behind is a chalk outline

[Verse 2 Instrumental : Chalk Outline; Vocals : E.T. ]

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial


[Verse 3 Instrumental : Resident Evil Theme; Vocals : E.T. ]

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
You're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 4 Instrumental : Hold me down; Vocals : Hold me down ]

I've been through this before
It's nothin' new, it's nothin' new
It's nothin' new, it's nothin' new
I don't know why
Everytime I wanna fly
Somebody always tries
To hold me down
Hold me down, yeah
I'm losing my faith
Every single time I try
The waters on my side
Don't let me drown
Let me drown


[Verse 5 Instrumental : Hold me down & [I'm so sick]; Vocals : E.T. & (I'm so sick) ]

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
Kiss me, supernatural, extraterrestrial
Take me
( Infected with, where I live
Let me live without, this
Empty bliss
Selfishness
[I'm so, I'm so sick ! )
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural]

[Verse 6 Instrumental : E.T. & {What It Is To Burn}; Vocals : E.T. & (What It Is To Burn) & [Esport Caster] ]

I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all, all

[On the side, and well that's what happens when you go around the corner
Happy with one deag ] yeah
[Oh an other one
OH ANOTHER ONE
HAPPY CAN HE GET THE QUAD
GETTING THE ACE WHAT IS THIS !]
Take me ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction

Infect me with your loving and
Fill me with your poison

[Verse 1]
Everybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catchin' up with folks we barely know
Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Verse 2]
So, Mr. Santa (Mr. Santa)
Take the day off (Take the day off)

No, we ain't stressin' (We ain't stressin')
Just caressin' (Mm-hmm)
Warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' (Nothing's missin')

Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)

A cozy little Christmas here with you

Just you and me, under a tree
A cozy little Christmas here with you



I'll blow you a kiss from across the room
I'll let it miss so you don't assume
Please tell me that you want me, you need me
Doesn't matter if you don't believe me
I have no one to call me baby
Sure is sad no one calls you lately
I try to run but I don't know how to get there
Keep on running you're going nowhere

You fear the sunrise, you can dry your eyes, your crocodile tears

I just need a man who will stay
You can save it for a rainy day
Won't you help me get my life on track?
I'd oblige but you stabbed me in back
Ride with me, I'm headed south
I can't believe a single word from your mouth
You and me are like biscuits and gravy
Now I know that you're crazy

You fear the sunrise, you can dry your eyes, your crocodile tears

Can't believe a word you say
You can save it for a rainy day
Had to tell you not once, but twice
You need to take your own advice



[Intro]
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new

[Verse 1]
I know tomorrow, I'll be love hungover
But I'm ready for a shameless summer
Champagne on ice only makes you stronger

[Pre-Chorus]
Pourin' it, pourin' it, pourin' it nonstop (Ah)
Drinkin' it, drinkin' it, drinkin' it all up (Ah)

I'll cry about it later

Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new

[Verse 2]
I think I'm ready to be someone's new muse
I think I'm ready for a brand new tattoo (Give me it)
I'm gonna fake it 'til it makes me feel good

[Pre-Chorus]
Pourin' it, pourin' it, pourin' it nonstop (One more; ah, ooh)
Drinkin' it, drinkin' it, drinkin' it all up (Ah, ooh)
Body to body, I almost forgot
You're not him, you're not her, yeah

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ooh
I know tomorrow, I'll be love hungover (Ooh)
And it's half past three (Past three)
And I got angel wings (Wings)
But a devil's grin
And only one can win
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I'll cry about it later

[Verse 1]
Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
(I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock)
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight I'm walking on air)
Tonight I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air
Tonight I'm walking on air (Another one in the basket)
Tonight, tonight  I'm walking on air (Can't touch this)
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (Another one in the casket)
Tonight I'm walking on air (Swish, swish, bish)
Let's go!
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
But they don't know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the ----?

[Verse 1]
We woke up late, said goodbye
Now I'm standing outside on the street
I walk through the city, I'm laughing
Boucayes staring down at my feet
And I look up at the sky
Am I falling?
Open up and pull me in
I feel like an angel who's fallen
I just gotta have
This first taste of original sin

[Chorus]
Damn, can you feel it?
Damn, I can't believe it
Damn, you got me feelin' good
Damn, do you dig it?
That's the way you do it
Damn, you know you give it good

[Verse 2]
Two minutes later, I'm counting
The seconds and hours to go
I'm working a sweat out of bed
Just the thought of you is making me glow
I've got that you give it good
Now back up and just leave it alone
I'm walking on air 'cause you're crunk
Now I'm going home to do it all again on my own


[Chorus]
Damn, can you feel it?
Damn, I can't believe it
Damn, you got me feelin' good
Damn, do you dig it?
That's the way you do it
Damn, you know you give it good

[Post-Chorus]
You got my tongue, it's so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep sayin'
Damn, do you dig it?
That's the way you do it
Damn, you know you give it good

[Bridge]
Walk through the door and into your room
'Cause this whole world lies, but you tell me the truth
Think I'll give you up?
You're not gonna let me down
Your love is like an ocean
And I'm starting to drown

[Chorus]
Damn, can you feel it?
Damn, I can't believe it
Damn, you got me feelin' good
Damn, do you dig it?
That's the way you do it
Damn, you know you give it good


[Post-Chorus]
You got my tongue, it's so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep sayin'
Damn, do you dig it?
That's the way you do it
Damn, you know you give it good

[Outro]
Oh yeah yeah
I can't believe, I can't believe it
Oh, you got me feelin', yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
We woke up late, said goodbye
Now I'm standing outside on the street
I walk through the city, I'm laughing
In case staring down at my feet
If I look up, the sky might fall
Open up and pull me in
I feel like an angel who's fallen
But I just got to have the taste of original sin

[Chorus]
Damn, can you feel it?
Damn I can't believe it
Damn you got me feeling good
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

[Verse 2]
Two minutes later, I'm counting
The seconds and hours to go
Working a sweat out of bed
Just the thought of you is making me glow
I got the fact that you get it good
Now back up and just leave it alone
I'm walking on air cuz your crunk
Now I'm going home to do it all again on my own


[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You got my tongue, it's so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep saying:

Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

[Verse 4]
Walk through the door, and enter your room
Cause this whole world lies but you tell the truth
Do you think I'm gonna give you up?
You never gonna let me down
Your love is like an ocean and I'm starting to drown

[Verse 5]
You got my tongue, it's so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep saying:

Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good


[Outro]
Damn, I can't believe it, I can't believe it
Ooh you got me feeling good good good

[Verse 1]
I lost my tug of war today
Took my foot off of the brakes
(The definition of insanity is looping on repeat, and expecting things to change)
But what comes up must hit the ground
So I drink these anvils down
(She always comes to me highly disguised, an angel whispering, so many pretty shapes)

[Chorus]
It's a dance with the devil
A stumbling tango
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow

[Drop]
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance

[Verse 2]
Just want to connect
But you won't let me do it
So I get altered, (Twisted and conflicted, so I casually can shoot the shit)
Wish less was going on
Wish I could just throw the ball
And ignore it all
(Constantly distracted by the noise of my ping-pong)


[Chorus]
It's a dance with the devil
A mercurial wrestle
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow

[Drop]
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a...
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)

[Bridge]
But what, what is it worth
Waking up with a crown of clouds?
What is it worth
When my head spins out with doubt?
Wish I could measure
When the poison is pouring out
Oh...


[Outro]
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no (It's a...)

[PRE-Chorus]
He woke up, looked over
And he smiled for a while and said-

[Chorus]
That that was how we knew we were meant to be
Dancin' round in circles under willow trees
My head was saying "no"
My heart was saying "go"
Yeah, We were dancin' in the green
Dancin in the green

And so he said to me "thats the way to go"
Without no encounter, oh we'd never know
Our hearts were made of gold
And we began to glow
Oh we were dancin in the green, dancin in the green

Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh

Our hearts were made of gold
And we began to glow
We were dancin in the green
Dancin in the green

[Intro: Juicy J]
Yeah, ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage!

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (Enemy)
Your enemy (Your enemy), your enemy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away (Walk away)
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She's a beast, I call her Karma (Come back)
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer (Woo!)
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her (Meet her)
If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse (Like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (Ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (A perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
Young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Bridge]
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)


[Chorus]
(You make me)
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back (No)
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real (Oh-oh)
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Outro]
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight (tonight)

I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Verse 1]
I live off the echoes of your "I love you's"
But I still feel the blows from all of your "don't want to's" (Yeah)
When you're drunk, you say I'm the one
Then you wake up
You suck my hope up in a vacuum

[Chorus]
'Cause every day's the same
Definition of insane
I think we're running on a loop
Deja vu
So tell me something new
Figure out the Rubik's Cube
I think we're running on a loop
Deja vu

[Verse 2]
Your words are like Chinese water torture
And there's no finish line, always one more corner
Yeah, they slither like a centipede
Why do you keep me
At the end of a rope that keeps getting shorter?

[Chorus]
'Cause every day's the same
Definition of insane
I think we're running on a loop
Deja vu
So tell me something new
Figure out the Rubik's Cube
I think we're running on a loop
Deja vu

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
'Cause every day's the same
Definition of insane

Figure out the Rubik's Cube
I think we're running on a loop
Deja vu (Deja, deja, deja vu)
'Cause every day's the same (Every day's the same)
Definition of insane (Definition of insane)
I think we're running on a loop
Deja vu (Deja, deja, deja vu)

[Outro]
Deja vu


[Verse 1]
I've got people to see
Places to go
Deadlines to meet
A reputation to up hold
It's like a ton of bricks
Breaking on my back
It's like
The force of gravity
In full effect

[Verse 2]
I got money to burn
And I'm on the sake
They bet their bomb on me
Cause I'm their ace of spades
I feel the walls
Getting closer
I'm like a bomb
With all red wires

[Chorus]
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
I'm gonna be


[Verse 3]
A diamond
It won't ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends a diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for

[Verse 4]
If not for the push
I'd probably be a pebble
If not for the pressure
I'd be forgotten forever
Just another stone
Skipped upon the water
Drowning fast before
The other failures

[Verse 5]
I don't wanna be
A distant memory
On your wall
Just another cd
That you burned
And never bought
Am I not worth it to you?
After all that drama
That we've been though?


[Chorus]
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
I'm gonna be

[Verse 6]
A diamond
It won't ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends
A diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for

[Verse 7]
Ooh ooh  diamond
I've gotta be a diamond
(I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if I fall)
Oh  oh  oh
Yeah yeah yeah


[Chorus]
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
I'm gonna be

[Verse 8]
I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if I fall
Into the arms of a coma

[Outro]
All this pressure
I've got pressure
I'm gonna be a diamond baby
I've gotta be a diamond
Your gonna see
I'm gonna be a diamond



[Verse 1]
You're a one-of-a-one, a one-of-a-kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks open the gold mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
When I found you, it was all pitter-patter

[Verse 2]
Secretly, I hit the lottery
'Cause you're brighter than all of the Northern Lights
You speak to me, even in my dreams
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever

[Chorus]
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

[Verse 3]
Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, loud like lightning
It was striking, you couldn't deny it

[Pre-Chorus 3]
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
The two of us together make everything glitter

[Chorus]
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

[Bridge]
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you (Oh)
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you (Oh)
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go (And wherever you go), so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

[Outro]
It's hard to find
Oh, it's hard to find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime


Unreleased

Saucer of milk
Table for two
You wanna pet my kitty?
You're such a dirty doggie
It's your lucky night
'Cause I'm in the mood, oh, I'm feeling spicy
I'm feeling real naughty

[Refrain]
Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen, a Lolita
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

Ooh, my Cookie Monster wants a taste test
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer

Pick a part, you dream it up
Librarian, dominatrix
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy

Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?

[Verse 3]
You're getting hot, so let's call the nurse
Ooh, I feel a fever
Let's take your temperature
Better behave
Or a police officer will have to hold you down
Give you what you deserve

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Pick a part, you dream it up
Use your imagination
Oh boy, I'll be your fantasy
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)

Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

[Bridge]
Tied tight, tip, teasing
Push, pull, pressure, pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck
Breathing deep, gaining speed, 'bout to peak
Trembling, trembling, trembling

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you (Oh)

All along the western front
People line up to receive
She's got the current in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe
Sun in the amazon
With the voltage running through his skin
Standing there with nothing on
She's gonna teach me how to swim
Oh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Said, "ooh-ooh, girl...."
Shocked me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
Said, "ooh, girl...."

All along the eastern shore
Put your circuits in the sea
This is what the world is for
Making electricity
'Cause you can feel it in your mind
Oh, you can do it all the time
Plug it in and change the world
'Cause, you are my electric girl-irl-irl

I can see your love in a fingerprint
It ain't no mystery, I believe
When a feather falls right next to me, yeah

You might be so far away, but you're so close
We're like the lighting and thunder
A million miles from each other
But so close, yeah

Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot

Landed in a pod in Little Britain, David Walliams
Now I'm in your Sun, your Star, your Mirror and your Mail again
I'm Saville Row ten remixed with vintage Nike blazers
I can read your body language like you just came out of LA Ink
Caps lock, baby, cause I'm all about my capital
I think so irrational, I'm big international
All my raps is factual, I'm so supernatural
And I've been fly a very long time, terminators

You could throw me in the fire

And no one can bring me down

Hey!
Now nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
And do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking, you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Flyin' first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Big Sean]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Woah, woah, woah
Feels with me
Don't be afraid to catch feels (No, no)

Wow, that felt great
That one felt awesome
Can you hear the back, yeaa can we hear that back




[Verse 1]
Voted most likely to end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting 'em down
'Cause 7.75 isn't worth an hour of my hard working time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh, I'm worth more than a X
More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Oh, I won't settle, no oh
Oh, I can't settle

[Pre Chorus]
I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight

[Chorus]
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you

[Verse 2]
Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather than end up begging on the streets
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more than this
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention

[Pre Chorus]
I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight

[Chorus]
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints

[Bridge]
Don't give up
Don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh, not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand, in the sand

[Chorus]
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me

'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints

I-I'm leaving my fingerprints in the end




[RACHEL]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin?
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
6-feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em goin' "Oh, oh, oh"

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, can not be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed:
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em goin' "Oh, oh, oh"

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em goin' "Oh, oh, oh"

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

[Verse 1: Dani, Amy]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus: Christina]
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

[Chorus: Katherine]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe


[Verse 2: Lisa]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane, comes a rainbow
Maybe the reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you know

[Pre-Chorus: Christina]
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

[Chorus: Katherine]

Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

Thank you, to you
No, really, all of you
For helping donate over 25,000 to Teach for America
And now, albeit a bit late
Here's something I've been promising you for quite a while...

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag

You know, let them see what you're worth
This song has been my mortal enemy for about four years now
I cannot and could not sing it!
And I'm gonna go home and never think about this again
Thank you

[Intro]
Look at those beautiful eyes
She reminds me so much of me
Starting out in a brand new world
Who she gonna be?
Will she follow everything that's been said?
Maybe listen to her heart instead
Maybe she needs to be free
She got that from me

[Verse 1]
What you get is what you see
It's a fantasy life, but it's real to me
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't want to live in a box or mansion fault with doors and locks so I never let anyone put me through it

[Chorus]
Need that freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it
Give it up to you
Need that freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it
Do it all for you

Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Do it all for you


[Verse Two]
They all talk, talk, talking at me
Telling me who I am, what to do with my body
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it
Grandma, soon I'll see you too when I overdose, tripping on my shoes
Be the next Queen of Pop

[Chorus]
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Do it all for you

[Bridge]
(Instrumental chimes and hymns)
Give it up to you
Do it all for you

[Chorus]
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Do it all for you

[Outro]
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
Can't you see?
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
That's all I want from me

[Refrain]
It's been dope
It's been sick
It's been funky
It's been hip

Look at my wings
They're fantasy, they're fairy
Now you are looking at me
You don't have 'em, I'm the boss
I'll give you where it hurts
With all my fairy dust
You roll crazy like a dice
Cause of my wings, my glitter
And oh my mind!

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been dope
It's been sick
It's been funky
It's been hip

[Chrous]
They say I'm nobody, I'm not worth anything, but I know that's just envy
With my wings they will go crazy
Cause' they shine more than those lazy
And if they don't get to buy my heart, then I don't consider 'em a f*cking threat
Funky

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I'll be back at eleven
You just act like a peasant
Got-got a bow on my panties
Because my ass is a present
Yeah-yeah, it's gooder than Meagan
You look good when you're beggin'
I-I be laughing when you beggin' me
To just put the head in
L-let me sit on your face
It's ok, you can play with it
When I'm bouncin' it, chill out
And don't you make a mistake with it

If I'm ridin', I'm murkin' it
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah
I bagged him, I Birkin'd it

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no

Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby, I'ma need you to beg (Beg, beg) for it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees (On your knees)
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
G-g-g-g-gimme brain
Assume the position
Make-make-make me way smarter
Like you was a magician
Paid my dues and tuition
It's good for your nutrition
Get head like a beautician
Got me twitchin', finish your mission (Finish your mission)
You make it come down
Y-y-y-you make it run down
I'ma need you to give these other dudes the rundown
You got that legendary
This shit is fake, scary
Got me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Nicki Minaj]
(Ah) I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby I'ma need you to beg (I'ma need you to beg)
Beg, beg for it (Let's go)

[Bridge: Ariana Grande & Nicki Minaj]
Cause we are just animals (Animals)
Baby it's primal (It's primal)
I want you on all fours (All fours)
And before I let you walk
You gotta show me how you crawl
If you want it all (Yeah, you want it all?)
It's non-negotiable
So do as I say (I say)
If you wanna get the job
You better know who's the boss
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional

[Verse 1]
You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building a life
With every kiss and every letter
Every promise of forever
Oh, but you hit "send"
And disappeared in front of my eyes

[Chorus]
And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now

[Verse 2]
Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
(I'll be alright) I'll be alright
It doesn't haunt me at night
'Cause every gift and every letter
Every promise of forever
Now, is out of sight
Like you were never alive

[Chorus]
And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now

[Bridge]
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
So, rest in peace
I'll see you on the other side

[Chorus]
And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you

[Outro]
Now, now, now, now, now
Oh, now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now




[Verse 1]
Got a call from my friend
She saw my picture again
In a magazine
We laughed out loud
'Cause she said, "Remember when this was all a silly dream?"
Now I wake up every day
In a different city
A smile on my face
Somebody pinch me
She said, "all the world's a stage"
But girl, you know
Those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me

[Chorus]
I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things
When I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

[Verse 2]
It's amazing to hear
People singing along
Hear the radio playing my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside
In the spotlight
Now every now and then
On a Friday night
Cruisin' down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend Saturday sleeping in late
Those were the good days

[Chorus]
I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things
When I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

[Bridge:]
And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots
From where I came
'Cause when it all fades away
My home will still be the same
Yeah, eh yeah

[Chorus]
I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things
When I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things
When I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

[Verse 2]
It's amazin' to hear people singin' along
Hear the radio playin' my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside
In the spotlight


[Pre Chorus]
Now every now and then
On a Friday night, cruisin' down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend saturday sleepin' in late
Yeah, those were the good days

[Sorry Not Sorry: Amy]
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Yeah
Payback is a bad chick
And baby, I'm the baddest
You messin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this (Oh)
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but no

[Break Free: Katherine]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Scared to Be Lonely: Lisa]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely?
(Scared to be lonely?)

[Blank Space: Amy, Lauren]
Nice to meet ya, where ya been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sent
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my gosh, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Woah
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Dark Horse: Katherine, Lisa]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[We Found Love: Katherine]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[You Say: Lauren]
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, You say I am Yours

[You Say/Halo: Katherine, Lauren]
And I believe
I can see your halo
Oh, I believe
I can see your halo
What You say of me
I can see your halo
I believe


[Halo: Amy, Lisa]
I can see your halo
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
I can see your halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
See your halo, halo
Halo
Halo
Ooh



[Verse 1: Sonny]
I can still see the light at the end of the tunnel shine
Through the dark times, even when I lose my mind
But it feels like no one In the world is listening
And I can't ever seem to make the right decisions
I walk around in the same haze
I'm still caught in my same ways
I'm losing time in these strange days
But somehow, I always know the right things to say

[Pre-Chorus: Sonny]
I don't know what time it is
Or who's the one to blame for this
Do I believe what I can't see?
And how do you know which way the wind blows?
'Cause I can feel it all around
I'm lost between the sound
And just when I think I know, there she goes

[Chorus: Sonny]
Goodbye for now
Goodbye for now, so long
Goodbye for now (I'm not the type to say I told you so)
Goodbye for now, so long
(I think the hardest part of holding on is lettin' go)
When will we sing
A new song
A new song

[Verse 2: Sonny]
We're still smilin' as the day goes by
And how come nobody ever knows the reasons why?
Bury you deep so far that you can't see
If you're like me, who wears a broken heart on your sleeve
Pain's is troubles that you know so well
Either time don't it can't or you just won't tell
I'm not the type to say I told you so
I think the hardest part of holding on is lettin' it go

[Pre-Chorus: Sonny]
I don't know what time it is
Or who's the one to blame for this
Do I believe what I can't see?
And how do you know which way the wind blows?
'Cause I can feel it all around
I'm lost between the sound
And just when I think I know, there she goes

[Chorus: Sonny]
Goodbye for now
Goodbye for now, so long
Goodbye for now (I'm not the type to say I told you so)
Goodbye for now, so long
(I think the hardest part of holding on is lettin' go)
When will we sing
A new song
A new song
When will we sing
A new song
A new song

[Verse 3: Sonny]
And you can sing until there's no song left (Song left)
And I can scream until the world goes deaf (Goes deaf)
For every other word left unsaid
You shoulda took the time to read the sign and see what it meant
(See what it meant)
In some ways, everybody feels alone
So if the burden is mine, then I can carry my own (Carry my own)
If joy really comes in the morning time
Then I'ma sit back and wait until the next sun rise

[Chorus: Sonny & Katy Perry]
Goodbye for now
Goodbye for now, so long
Goodbye for now (I'm not the type to say I told you so)
Goodbye for now, so long
(I think the hardest part of holding on is letting it go)
When will we sing
A new song
A new song
When will we sing
A new song
A new song
When will we sing? (When will we sing?)
A new song
A new song

[Verse 1]
You would think that I could find
A simple song, a photograph of mine
To show this public eye what I have to offer
I may not have a PhD
Or speak in eloquent philosophy
I'm nothing more than simply me, you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
What I am trying to say, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways

[Chorus]
I'm still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through

[Verse 2]
I don't regret, I'm not ashamed
That I haven't yet begun to speaketh ways (As the wisest of men)
Oh perhaps some day but for now I'm grateful
To be a part of the family tree
While The Man upstairs does His work on me
It's a job that may take eternity to complete
Just when I've learned all I can
Those growing pains up and kick on in again


[Chorus]
Still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through

[Verse 3]
Time after time, one more time and again
Will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
But young or old, I am told it's the same
Oh, these growing pains never go away
So I'll just keep on trying

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
What I am trying to say, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways

[Chorus]
Still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
Oh, baby don't worry about a thing


[Outro]
Thank you
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you



[Verse 1]
I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in period one
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
Yeah, I saw you talking to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen

[Chorus]
But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

[Verse 2]
I used to work at the record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off of the hardwood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A
That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days

[Chorus]
And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah

[Outro]
Thank you, thank you

[Verse 1]

Cruisin' down a heart-shaped highway
Got you swervin' lane-to-lane, don't hit the brakes
'Cause I'm feelin' so safe

(VERSE 1)
Me and Katy riding Harleys in Hawaii
Looking over at the sea
It's the perfect place to be
You can chill and relax on the beach
Sipping martinis while women are in bikinis
This is the perfect life
This is so nice
Katy my lady you know what I want baby
We can ride motorcycles all day
And not have a thought on our brains
Hawaii is a paradise its so exclusive
This island is all inclusive
We can get swedish massages
While wearing designer watches
We can ride up and down the island
We can have some fun in the highlands

(KATY CHORUS)
You and I
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii, I

We're riding our bikes around town
Up and down the streets are our playground
We are going so fast it's 0-60 in seconds
We're flying through the interstate like legends
I hope we don't end up wrecking
I bet we'll be fine I reckon
I love driving this hog with no directions
I'm acting completely wreckless
I love the adrenaline and the essence
Of being completely free on the open road
With anywhere we want to go

(KATY CHORUS)
You and I
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii, I
I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
Want you to take me for a ride, ride (oh)
When I hula-hula, hula
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler
There's pink and purple in the sky, I
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii, I




[Intro]
(Hawaii-i-i, oh)
(Call me your baby, catch the same wave, oh)

[Verse 1]
Boy, tell me, can you take my breath away?
Cruisin' down a heart-shaped highway
Got you swervin' lane-to-lane, don't hit the brakes
'Cause I'm feelin' so safe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town?
Call me your baby, on the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down

[Chorus]
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

Let me run my fingers through your salty hair
Go ahead, explore the island vibes
So real that you can feel it in the air
I'm revvin' up your engine

Oh, why don't we get out of town?
Call me your baby, catch the same wave

A big beautiful brain with a pretty face, yeah

Red lipstick, but still so raw, yeah
Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck

Smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping the cliches and norms all in a dress

Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Faberge
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me

[Bridge]
I ain't got no strings (No strings, no strings, no strings)
I'm no one's little puppet
Got my own cha-ching, in my chubby little wallet
And secretly you love it

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
You gotta take the highs with the lows
Sometimes it's just how it goes
And when your down to nothing at all
Its always predictable
Postpone your broken dreams
While flipping through the pages of a magazine
You gotta take the highs with the lows

[Verse 1]
Your Instagram, embarrassing
Living a poser life
Got bigger lips and paid friendships
But losing the light in your eyes
Your only friend, your reflection
Arching your back for likes
I knew you when we'd laugh at them
Now you're the stereotype (Stereotype)

[Chorus]
Oh babe, you got high on your supply
You fell in, and now you're trippin'
Yeah, you got high on your supply
Bought the hype and now you're slippin'
You got a head so swollen
You got a vibe so broken
Why oh, why do you keep telling yourself all of them lies

[Post-Chorus]
High on your supply
High on your supply
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie


[Verse 2]
You're cooler than these sycophants
Who wanna be part of the show
It's hard to hear, but oh so clear
You're not in on the joke
I'm only here because I care
I know it's a lonely road
I knew you when we had nothin'
And that's why I don't blow smoke (I won't blow smoke)

[Chorus]
Oh babe, you got high on your supply
You fell in, and now you're trippin'
Yeah, you got high on your supply
Bought the hype and now you're slippin'
You got a head so swollen
You got a vibe so broken
Why oh, why do you keep telling yourself all of them lies

Who will be around when you come down from off your cloud?
Tell me, who will be around when you come down from off your cloud?

Oh babe, you got high on your supply (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
You fell in, and now you're trippin'
Yeah, you got high on your supply
Bought the hype and now you're slippin'
You got a head so swollen (You got a head so)
You got a vibe so broken (You got a vibe so)
Why oh, why do you keep telling yourself all of them lies

[Intro]
Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it

[Verse 1]
Slow motion, sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys oh, yes they will
They don't want to define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills, then get cold feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

[Verse 2]
I can't cook, no but I can clean
Up the mess you left
Lay your head down
And feel the beat as I kiss

[Verse 3]
Your forehead, this may not last
But this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase
But you're chasing your tail
Quick fix won't ever get you well

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

[Bridge]
'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with a snap of your fingers
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

Put the bottle down
'Cause you don't
Wanna miss out

Then you ran away, left me here in this pose
How am I supposed to play with you?

You're in then you're out
I'm starting to doubt
You
You don't really wanna play, no
You just really wanna go

Just like twins, so in sync
Used to laugh while we played
Now you just run away
Didn't know, that you were gonna change

He's in and he's out

Gotta chase him all over
How to catch him, I wonder
He's too quick for me

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Elmo]
You
You don't really wanna play, no

You stop then you go

Well, Elmo is playing Ms. Katy
Elmo's playing tag
You're it! Ah ha ha ha
Not again!

We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're hot then you're cold
You're hot then you're cold

[Bridge]
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
Can't get off this ride


[Outro]
You're hot then you're cold
You're hot then you're cold
You're hot then you're cold
You're hot then you're cold
You're hot then you're cold
You're hot then you're cold

[Intro]
You're hot then you're cold

[Verse 1]
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch
I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're hot then you're cold




[Verse 2]
We used to be just like twins
So in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing, now you're plain boring
I should know that you're not gonna change

[Chorus]
You're hot then you're cold
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're hot then you're cold


[Bridge]
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
Can't get off this ride

[Outro]
You're hot then you're cold
You're hot then you're cold

[Intro: Katy Perry]
Hot, hot, hot...

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch
I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

[Chorus: Yelle & Katy Perry]
You're hot hot hot
Then you're cold cold cold
You gimme gimme gimme then you fall fall fall
You're hot hot hot

You tease me tease me tease me then you go go go
T'es comme / ci comme ca
Ca va bien / je sais pas
J'aime le chaud / t'aimes le froid
Si je danse / tu fais quoi ?
Je n'ai pas le temps d'attendre
Que tu te decides
Tu ne m'auras plus comme avant avec un battement de cils
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot (get out)

Si je danse / tu fais quoi ?
Je n'ai pas le temps d'attendre
Que tu te decides
Tu ne m'auras plus comme avant avec un battement de cils
J'avance plus vite que la musique
T'as interet a me suivre
Si tu ne veux pas que je te quitte
Je ne te vois plus comme avant
Tu ne me va plus comme un gant
Je ne vais pas faire semblant
Surprends moi, ou va t'en


[Interlude: Katy Perry & (Yelle)]
Then you're cold (va t'en)
Then you're no, (va t'en)

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Hot, hot, hot...
Hot, hot, hot...
Hot, hot, hot...



[Verse 1]
You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time, every time when you're touching me
I make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun, we are one buzzing energy
Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science (Science), we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees

[Pre-Chorus]
And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

[Chorus]
You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I've flown a million miles, just to find a magic seed
A white flower, with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, get my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You keep me alive and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies

[Pre-Chorus]
And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

[Chorus]
You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

[Bridge]
You love me, you love me
Never love me not, not, oh no
When we're in a perfect harmony
You make me sound like, like a symphony, oh

[Chorus]
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh, spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat


[Verse 1]
I was raised on sundays and one ways
A room with glass stained views
Picture perfect washed in the words
That were my only truth

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's not that I'm letting you go
Oh, but now I'm all grown up
And I need to know

[Chorus]
I'll make mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can

[Verse 2]
Scared of asking too many questions
Scared to make the choice
From the beginning, you'll be my ending
If you can hear my voice


[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause it's not that I'm giving you up
Oh, your name is engraved, oh
And so is your love

[Chorus]
But I'll make mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can

[Bridge]
Oh, always
There's always
Times we have to leave
Oh, but I know that
When I need you
Oh, you will rescue me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll makes mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can


[Outro]
Oh, when the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can

[Verse 1]
Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down
You got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you found it
Slow motion sparks, you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh yes, they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills, then get cold feet

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

[Verse 2]
I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beats
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last, but this is now
So love the one you're with
You want a chase, but you're chasing your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say...

[Bridge]
'Cause I feel the distance
Between us
Could be over with a snap of your finger
Oh, no

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight to say
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight to say goodnight

[Outro]
Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down
'Cause you don't wanna miss out




[Verse 1: Timbaland]
What's somebody like you, doing in a place like this?
Say, did you come alone, or did you bring all your friends?
Say what's your name, what you drinkin'?
I think I know what you're thinking
Baby, what's your sign?
Tell me yours, I'll tell you mine
Say, what's somebody like you
Doing in a place like this?
(One, two, three, c'mon!)

[Chorus: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again

Ohh, ohh

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before (Before, yeah)
Hope you don't see me blush, but I can't help but want you more, more
Baby, tell me what's your story?
I ain't shy and don't you worry
I'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight
Do you come here much?
I gotta see your face some more
Some more, 'cause baby...

[Outro: Sebastian]
Just when the night can't get no less
Porn star startin', what is this?
Vixens fightin' for their stress
I put in like Mr. West, yes
You gon' finish dear
And your body's so superb
Me and you the best in here
But yo' girl, face and ear
Face and ear, face and ear
Face and ear, face and ear

[Verse 1]
If you want me
The cherry on top, the pick of the pack, the creme de la crop
If you want me, you better do better than that tonight
Oh-oh
If you want me, it takes more than a wink
More than a drink, more than you think
If you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank, tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill, 'cause that's the deal

[Chorus]
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

[Verse 2]
If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass
A one-night stand, a storage shed
I think you better walk by, tonight, oh no
If you want me, then stop begging
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight


[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I don't need your dollar bills
I just want something real
'Cause nothing's free, except loving me

[Chorus]
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

[Breakdown]
If you want me
The cherry on top, the pick of the pack, the creme de la crop

[Chorus]
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

[Verse 1]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick

Oh, excuse me, you think I'm into drama?
A-five-six-seven-eight!

[Verse 1]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey


[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it

I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

Call me John Witherspoon

Me and Mrs. Jane-Jane
Watch us do our thang
They say I only name one
But they both got the same name (Same name)
They call me Big Daddy, but I ain't Cane/Kane
I got a homeless personality
I can't change
I mean I'm so on top, it's like another world
I am MIMS

[Rap Verse 2: MIMS]
My Girl Gotta Girlfriend, she said she kissed a girl
Won't fill me no details, cause she don't, kiss and tell
Man, I'm in a different world
Is this heaven, is this hell
Some say I'm a lucky man like I fell into a wishing well
Even though I'm livin' well
Somethin' just ain't sittin' well
She gettin' more play than me
Every night, it's a different girl
But I don't mind it
I find it
Somethin' sort of excitin'
My girl kissed a girl, and guess what
She liked it (Liked it)

[Verse 1]
You're never boring, you're always changing (always)
You're so amazing, every word you say
I'm serious, delirious, I'm into this, I'll let you lead the way
I'm wild about you, I'm mad about you, what more can I say?

[Chorus]
(I mean what I was tryin' to say was)
I love you and everything you do
I love you, I'll never say we're through
You love me too, the sun is shining, the world is smiling
And, baby, I love you

[Verse 2]
Your stupid laugh, your silly grin
Your salty skin, I can't help myself
I wanna touch ya, baby, see what you make me
I wanna do to you things I'd never do
I'm stuck without you, I'm lost without you
What more can I say?

[Chorus]
I love you and everything you do
I love you, I'll never say we're through
You love me too, the sun is shining, the world is smiling
And, baby, I love you, I love you, I love you

[Bridge]
See these arms, they wanna hold you
See these eyes, they wanna watch you
See this mouth, it wants to kiss you
The wildest part is that I miss you
And with my arms wrapped around you
You're never ever gonna get away
I'm mad about you, I'm wild about you, what more can I say?

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, everything you do
I love you, oh baby, never say it's through
You love me too, the sun is shining, the world is smiling
And, baby, I love you
I love you and everything you do
I love you, don't ever say we're through
You love me too, the sun is shining, the world is smiling
And, baby, I love you
Yeah, oh oh, yeah, oh oh, yeah, oh oh, oh oh oh


[Verse 1]
Lightning strikes only once in your life
I guess I'm lucky 'cause I've found myself
In the line of fire tonight
My heart beats like thunder under my skin
And my world speaks in wonder since you appeared
Now we are here

[Chorus]
And I could die in your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame

[Verse 2]
Dreams hardly ever do come true
I guess I'm lucky 'cause I've found myself
Waking up right next to you
Oh, and with this raging heart of mine
I'll love you till the end of time
I thank the gods that our stars align
From the ocean floor to the distant sun
Forever more to kingdom come
Have no fear, I'll be burning here

[Chorus]
And I could die (I could die)
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame (A shame)
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame (Your immortal)
I'll be your (Your immortal)
Ooh, I'll be your (Your immortal)
Oh, I'll be your (Your immortal flame)


[Bridge]
And I could die in your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame

[Outro]
Love you again and again
An everlasting fantasy
I'll be your immortal

[Verse 1]
I leave the gas on
Walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention?
'Cause I'm sending all the signs that

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The clock is ticking
And I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black
You'd best prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh


[Verse 2]
Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education
And I swore way too much
But I swear you didn't care
'Cause we were in love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
It's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Oh, we've been diagnosed
So let's give up the ghost
'Cause I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh


[Outro]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
Ohh


[Verse 1]
You come over, don't talk
Turn the TV on off
Disconnected, unaffected
Better take the call

[Verse 2]
Show you pictures of my hometown
A pin could drop from miles down
What's the use in trying to be a girlfriend
When I know just what we are

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's nothing in common
Except the bed we lay on

[Chorus]
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

[Verse 3]
You're a habit I can't break
Disaster to eliminate
What part of no do I not understand?
When you're no good for me


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause I know we will never
Be some kind of forever

[Chorus Extended]
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between
Cause I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing
How did we become a one-night stand?
Hanging on the thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no
Oh, it's empty in between

[Bridge]
You come over
Yeah, it's over
Oh, we know just what we are

[Chorus Extended]
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between
Cause I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing
How did we become a one-night stand?
Hanging on the thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no
Oh, it's empty in between

[Verse 1]
Flowers in her hair, she don't care
Peach-pink lips, yeah, everybody stares
(Ooh) You think you've seen her in a magazine
(Ooh) It's like she walked right out of your dreams
Black Ray Bans, you know she's with the band
Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan
(Ooh) Yeah, she runs the place like Penny Lane
(Ooh) Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane
From Tokyo, to Mexico, to Rio!

[Chorus]
That girl's a trip
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile

[Verse 2]
She's got that je ne sais quoi, you know it
So tres chic, yeah, she's a classic
(Ooh) Yeah, she's footloose and so fancy free
(Ooh) Yeah, she dances to a her own beat
'Cause she's the muse and the artist
Always leaves a trail of stardust
(Ooh) 'Cause she's a little bit of Yoko
(Ooh) And she's a little bit of, "Oh no"
From LA, Miami, to New York City!

[Chorus]
That girl's a trip
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can (Catch her if you can)
Yeah, she's so in demand (In demand)
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile

[Spoken Interlude]
Please fasten your seatbelts
And make sure your champagne glasses are empty
We are now approaching the runway
So get ready for take-off

[Breakdown]
She's got that international smile
She's got that one international smile

[Chorus]
That girl's a trip (Girl's a trip)
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile (She's got that smile)
Catch her if you can (If you can)
Yeah, she's so in demand (So in demand)
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile

[Verse 1]
I built a wall so high, no one could reach
A life of locks, I swallowed all the keys
I was petrified, only knew how to hide
They can't hurt me if they don't know me
A full facade made a mirage outta me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then you came and started digging for a treasure underneath
And you found a better version of me I had never seen

[Chorus]
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?

[Verse 2]
I was a ship floating aimlessly
So camouflaged, was my own worst enemy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then you came in like a sailor with a heart that anchored me
And every day, I wake up grateful I'm no longer lost at sea

[Chorus]
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?

[Bridge]
Oh, 'cause no one's ever seen me like this
Seen right through the bullshit
I pray that I can keep unfolding
Pray that I can just stay open
Just stay open, just stay open, just stay open

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause you broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open and now I'm ready
This is intimacy




[Verse 1]
I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
He introduced me, was always just the friend
I bought a new dress, he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired, of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman

[Chorus]
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it

[Verse 2]
You were such a surprise
An unexpected gift
Said I was pretty, and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to, being loved the right way?
I want to argue, but there is nothing to say

[Chorus]
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
(Ready for it)
Oh, love, I think I'm ready

[Verse 3]
'Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah, we talk for hours, you still want to listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
So scared to feel this way

[Chorus]
But, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
(Ready for it)
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
(Ready for it)
Oh, love, I think I'm ready

[Verse 1]
This was big for us
Forever changing you and me
Allow me to be ambiguous
Though I can't stand ambiguity
I'll beat around this burning bush
Trying to put the fire out
When all the shoving came to push
The words just stayed stuck in my mouth

[Chorus]
'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone
Ba da da dum
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

[Verse 2]
So we might lose
But I'm glad I didn't leave
I wear my soul on my shoes
If not my heart upon my sleeve
If I'm not allowed to speak aloud
Of what you really mean to me
Then'll type it bold when I spell it out
I T S L O V E


[Chorus]
'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone
Ba da da dum
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

[Bridge]
So why do I hesitate for my cocoon to break?
Second guess every move that I make
(Second guess every move that you make)
This was big for us
Changing you and me

[Chorus]
Oh, somebody tell me
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

[Outro]
Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah



[Verse 1]
Is Mercury in retrograde?
Or is that the excuse that I've always made?
'Cause I wanna blame you
But I can only blame myself
Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
Or call you crazy, while filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I can only take responsibility for me

[Chorus]
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" (I'm sorry)

[Verse 2]
I've faced my demons, yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up, I wish you could too
I wanted to save you
But I can only save myself

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I can only be the change I want to see
Yeah, to see

[Chorus]
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, yeah, oh
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" (I'm sorry)

[Bridge]
I point my finger, but it does me no good
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why are these lessons always learned the hard way?
Is it too late to change?

[Chorus]
Oh, it takes two (It takes two)
Two sides to every story
Not just you (Not you)
I can't keep ignoring
And I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh
It takes two (It takes two)
Two sides to every story
Not just me (Not me)
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" (I'm sorry)
I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
So when my voice breaks
It's called interpretation
When I hold a note, it's 'cause I want to
Not 'cause I feel anything about you
So don't flatter yourself thinking
That I love you, make you emotional
From major to the minor, when I lose control
I'm not trying to impress you

[Pre-Chorus]
Break it down
And I get your attention
But it's just formula
Don't need your validation, validation

[Chorus]
This is just a song
The music plays and then, then it's gone again
This is just a song, the words don't mean a thing
So every time I sing, "I loved you all along"
Remember, remember this is just a song

[Verse 2]
Now I've been nothing, yes, I'm on auto-pilot
Have selfish words, even singing while I'm sleeping
Just 'cause you have showed up here to see me
Doesn't mean I'm going home with you this evening
I know December is the month we met
But it rhymes with remember, or did you forget?
I was only giving a performance
I hadn't noticed you were in the audience
In the audience

[Chorus]
This is just a song
The music plays and then, then it's gone again
This is just a song, the words don't mean a thing
So every time I sing, "I loved you all along"
Remember, remember this is just

[Bridge]
Everybody knows that this is just a song
And I don't feel a thing for you
Oh, everybody knows that rhythm, rhyme, and structure
Doesn't mean that I love you, oh no

[Chorus]
This is just a song
The music plays and then, then it's gone again
This is just a song, the words don't mean a thing
So every time I sing, "I loved you all along"
Remember, remember this is just
It's just a song

[Verse 1]
Hello, hello I'm searchin' for a man
With love filled eyes and them healing hands
Hello, hello I've been waiting for so long
Don't disconnect me 'cause it's my last call
For help, yeah, help
For help

[Chorus]
'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna say goodbye
Still fifteen minutes for my thirty-five
And where's this good in goodbye?
Cause talking to you is bringing me
This life, yeah, life
This life, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, last call
My last call, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name
8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name
8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name
8-9-9-3-8-3-3
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord I'm calling on Your name
I'm calling on Your name
I'm calling on Your name

[Outro]
This is my last call
This is my last call

[Verse 1]
Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom
Come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra

[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary (La la la la la)

[Verse 2]
Go down in history, go down together
Into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra, your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary (La la la la la)

[Interlude]
(Check it out)
Legendary lovers, legendary lovers, legendary lovers

[Breakdown]
Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

[Chorus]
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers (Legendary lovers)
We should be legendary (La la la la la)
Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath (Underneath the sun) the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum (Oh baby, legendary lovers)
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary (La la la la la)
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary (La la la la la)

[Verse 1: Ferras]
Rev-up, leave 'em all in the dust
Got a Cadillac six pack vision of us
Tonight we ride high into the desert sky
Hands up, feel the heat in the air
Legends never die, they play truth or dare
Tonight, we stop time, let go of the wheel and drive
How does it feel to fly?

[Chorus: Ferras with Katy Perry]
We are the stars that shine
We don't even have to try
We could go down in flames
But we'll melt the world away
All I know is you're my rock and roll
And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes
They don't make 'em like you and I
Legends never die

[Verse 2: Katy Perry with Ferras]
Undressed in a beautiful mess
But I got your gold heart right here on my chest
They say we're crazy, so baby, let's go insane
It's anarchy when we're together
I know we will live forever
Maybe one day, we'll make history
How does it feels to be free?

[Chorus: Ferras & Katy Perry]
We are the stars that shine
We don't even have to try
We could go down in flames
But we'll melt the world away
All I know is you're my rock and roll
And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes
They don't make 'em like you and I
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die
Legends never

[Bridge: Ferras & Katy Perry]
Burn out, just to fade away
We keep the clock turning like a figure eight
Tonight we stop time, let go of the wheel
And drive

[Chorus: Ferras & Katy Perry]
We are the stars that shine
We don't even have to try
We could go down in flames
But we'll melt the world away
All I know is you're my rock and roll
And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes, heroes
They don't make 'em like you and I
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die

[Outro: Ferras & Katy Perry]
(All I know is you're my rock and roll
And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes, heroes)
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die
They don't make 'em like you and I
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die

[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
I felt it, the wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter, I never saw it coming
I started to black out and then someone said good mornin'
I took it as a warning, I should've seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on this thing we may have started
Intentional or not I don't think we saw it coming
It's all addin' up to something
That asks for some involvement, that asks for a commitment
I think I see it comin' if we stepped out on that limb

[Pre-Chorus]
My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

[Chorus]
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take a long shot

[Verse 2]
I realize that there is all this doubting
Things we're both scared about that
We'll never see 'em coming, throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing into this fully knowing
We'll never see it coming 'til it's much too close to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take a long shot

[Bridge]
Oh, I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming, but we'll make it

[Chorus]
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance, no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it (So take a long shot)
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it (You didn't expect this)
It's a long shot, but I say why not (Oh, you never saw me coming)
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it (You didn't expect this)
It's a long shot just to beat these odds (Oh, you never saw me coming)
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
It's a long shot, but I say why not

Oh, I'm taking this chance on you, baby
I'm taking this chance on you, baby
I'm taking this chance

[Verse 1]
I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high, but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus 1]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost

[Verse 2]
Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town, pulling me down
My mother says I should come back home, but
Can't find the way, 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?

[Chorus 2]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?

[Bridge]
Is there a light?
Is there a light?
At the end of the road
I'm pushing everyone away, 'cause I can't feel this anymore
Feel this anymore

[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Have you ever been so lost?




[Verse 1]
Out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high, but looking so low
Party favors on the floor

So many new fair-weather friends

[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost

[Verse 2]
Caught in the eye of the hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down
My mother said I should come back home, but
Can't find the way, 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?

[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever, have you ever, been, yeah
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
Oh
Is there a light?
Is there a light?
At the end of the road
Cause I'm pushing everyone away, 'cause I can't feel this anymore
I Can't feel

[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so, so lost
So lost, oh yeah
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so...
Have you, Have you ever been, been so lost

[Outro]
Da da da da da dum
Thanks


Everybody's reading the book
About the boy from Bethlehem
Story of a kid who would change
The world with the palm of his hand
So bring me some toast before you go

Because I'm beginning to see that the story is quite okay
Cuz I've seen movies, and I wear the shirts
But what does this story really say
From my love didn't come from fantasy
Or to play glamorous roles, for the

Company man that we've all made him out to be
Is not what the story has told

So entertain me if you want to
But I've heard it all
If you feel the need to say more than what's been said
But I'm sure Love can stand on His own
But I'm sure Love can stand on His own

Still she sings her top 20
About the boy she doesn't even know
Written by a man they call money
He's winning birds while saving souls
It's of the man, the marketing plans
And a new Mercedes for his 17 year old wife


He's really diggin' on the girl with the top 20
Ain't it funny
For my Love didn't come to win Grammys
Or to be the king of rock n' roll, for the

Company man that we've all made him out to be
Is not what the story has told

So entertain me if you want to
But I've heard it all
If you feel the need to say more than what's been said
But I'm sure Love can stand on His own
Oooh, entertain me if you want to
I'm sure Love can stand on His own
I'm sure Love can stand on His own
Love can stand on His own

So turn your eyes from the glow
And remember the Son



[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I've played the song
Now it drives me crazy
I've run the race
Now I'm too damn lazy
This love of ours
Is a fading photograph yeah yeah
Now I must approach to life today
Seems a little different
Hard to say
But it looks like the end

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Time's up
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing
Changes nothing changes
Time's up
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train we wait for it
Even when it's gone

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
We've surfed the wave
Now we've hit the short end
We've squeezed the fruit
Till there's no more juice left
We're both so good
Good at keeping up the lie yeah yeah
Hey but no one's got to die
We can get it in prospective
Kiss my lips
Life is what we make it

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Time's up
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing
Changes nothing changes
Time's up
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train we wait for it
Even when it's gone

[Bridge: Katy Perry]
As I'm waving you goodbye
I want you to smile
Save a picture in your frame
File it right next to my name
I'm willing to die
For love willing to try
But not willing to lie for love
I know that this cakes already baked
Now its burning burning

[Hook: Katy Perry]
We can get it in prospective
Kiss my lips
Life is what we make it

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Time's up
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing
Changes nothing changes
Times up
Promise this time I'll get it off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train we wait for it yeah yeah
Even when it's gone
Time's up
Promise this time I get enough
Promise this time I'll get it off
Love is a train we wait for it
Even when it's gone

[Verse 1]
I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume
That I could just unzip and strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you're in love, in love with


[Pre-Chorus 2]
So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They're going to have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself the way I want you to
Love me

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

[Bridge]
No more standing in my own way
(Let's go deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way
(The way I want you to love me)
No more standing in my own way
(Let's go deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way
(The way I want you to love me)

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing my feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me



[Verse 1]
How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?
Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down a man is no workout
But I have no clue how to get through to you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood
Hoping there's a real boy inside

[Chorus]
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

[Verse 2]
I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in, make you talk
Even pull a string, for you to say anything
But with you, there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's out of my hands
I can't put you back together again

[Chorus]
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real, but you're not a man
You're just a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy and understand?
But you're not a man

[Bridge]
If the past is the problem, our future could solve them, baby
I could bring you to life if you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt, but in the end, you'll be a man

[Breakdown]
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real, oh
Toy...
Could you ever be a real, real boy?
Understand, but you're not a man


[Outro]
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

[Verse 1]

Dressed like an Indian prince baby
You lookin fine and so mighty
Hot cold can I take a bit baby
Be your first fruit burst lady

[Pre-Chorus]

So take it slow
Move my boat
Shake it more
I can take it all

[Chorus]

Masam Gunah ah ah
Take it to the next level
If you want another medal
Gunah ah ah
Masam Gunah ah ah

[Chorus]
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made

[Verse 1]
I know you're thirsty, baby, standing in the heat
I've got the juicy fruit, those sweet peaches and cream
You wanna wet your whistle, come and have a drink (ice cold)
Cool as a cucumber, you're coming on to me
You say "You got the ripest melons on the street"
My honeydew and your banana make a treat

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
But first comes, first serve
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy and new
But first comes, first serves, so bottoms up!

[Chorus]
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made

[Verse 2]
You'll have to count your calories when you're with me
Because my sugar gonna give you cavities
Don't wanna share me 'cause I'm such a tasty treat (Yum, yum)
I'll let you double dip it in your favorite sauce
I'll even let you eat the cherry on the top
You'll beg for seconds in a diabetic shock (What?)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
But first comes, first serve
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy and new
But first comes, first serves, so bottoms up!

[Chorus]
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made

[Bridge]
Open 24 hours, more than 31 flavors
To satisfy your craving
I know you're sick of the Kool-Aid, I got your upgrade
One sip, you'll be salivating

[Chorus]
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made


[Verse 1]
I'm losing all direction
Slipping into quicksand
I've shattered the illusion
Seen behind the curtain
I'm disenchanted
Dancing on a wire
Juggling desire
Every hit gets harder
When you're fighting without armor
I'm disheartened

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

[Chorus]
It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

[Verse 2]
I used to be so sparkling
But now it's not so charming
What used to stimulate me
Now can barely wake me
I'm unresponsive
Will I find salvation?
Some kind of moderation?
Spinning all these plates is
Gonna be a challenge
A delicate balance


[Pre-Chorus]
So do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

[Chorus]
It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

[Refrain]
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way

[Outro]
So do I start over, re-rediscover?
I submit to your, your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
No



[Verse 1]
Saw your picture on accident
Your face has changed
The lines are sinking in
I pressed play, I should haven't
Congratulations
But do you ever wonder what we could have been?
(I wonder what we could have been)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But your mind plays tricks with distance
Always makes things feel so unfinished

[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)

[Verse 2]
I saw a balloon floating away
I thought, "Did someone let go, or did they lose it?"
So strange, you know all my secrets
Please keep them safe
And darling, you know that I'll do the same
(You know that I'll do the same)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Though we're no longer in existence
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit

[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you

[Bridge]
We were a match, but not a fit
We were a dream, unrealistic
We didn't lose, we didn't win
(Sometimes I wonder what we could have been)
Oh

[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
(Though we're no longer in existence)
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(You'll always be in my orbit)

[Outro]
Ohh-oh-oh-oh (You'll always be in my orbit)
No-oh-oh-oh-oh (You'll always be in my orbit)

[Verse 1]
One day I was sitting in class
Got a note saying watch your back
Someone told me who it was from
She wasn't happy because she just got dumped
It was over but not in her mind
It's not my fault he left her behind
I always knew they had a history
I didn't know it included me

[Pre-Chorus]
She wasn't ready to let him go
Now I'm dealing with a psycho

[Chorus]
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend
I think she's going off the deep end
She loves him, she hates me
They broke up now she wants to blame me
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 2]
Went to a party on a Saturday night
I wasn't planning to get in a fight
All I wanted was to have some fun
You know I'd never wanna hurt no one
She walked over thinking she was so tough
She stared me down but she had to look up
Then she started to lose control
What can I say that's rock and roll

[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't sure but now I know
That I'm dealing with a psycho

[Chorus]
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend
I think she's going off the deep end
She loves him she hates me
They broke up now she wants to blame me

[Bridge]
Wake up girl
'Cause it's over
It's time to get a life
Go cry on your own shoulder
Can't you see that he's mine

[Chorus]
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend
I think she's going off the deep end
She loves him she hates me
They broke up now she wants to blame me

[Outro]
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na an na na na
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na
My boyfriend's ex girlfriend
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
I turn my head, there's nothing there
All I own is my thoughts for my fears
I close the door to keep out the bad
I plug my ears to keep out these fears
And I cry

[Chorus]
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me

[Verse 2]
I listen to these voices
Or is it this house that's giving me chills
As I lie upon this little girl's bed?
Who's at the door? Who's walking near?
Or has my imagination spilled?
This little girl all grown up still fears
Oh, and I cry

[Chorus]
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me


[Verse 3]
Where can I go, where can I hide
From these evil sufferings?
Oh, these images painted on my walls
They say there's a place that I can
Hide in the shadow of your wings
Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge
No more tears

[Chorus]
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired, and tired and tired, and tired and tired
Oh, so tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me, oh, oh
I am so tired
Oh Lord, I'm so tired
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Hold me
Me, me

[Verse 1]
Did it seem to disappoint you, living alone?
By the banks of your dilemma, out of control
No one seems to give the answers, that you wanna hear
What you'd give to find a welcome here

[Verse 2]
Miles and miles of lies behind you, those were the days
So many lives you'd hope would guide you, help you find a way
Now it seems to your surprise that they left you lying here
What you'd give to dry these bitter tears

[Chorus]
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you

[Verse 3]
Heaven waits the hours of silence, finds you on your knees
Broken in a sweet surrender of peace
All the years of searching for a love you didn't know
Now you've finally found a welcome home

[Chorus]
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you


[Bridge]
I love you, I have
And I always will

[Chorus]
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you



[Verse 1]
I'm losing my self control
Yeah, you're starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
When I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Verse 2]
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Bridge]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(And I'll have to get over you all over again)
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(Over you all over again)

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]

But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet, oh no
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew a line
Right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over

Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done
But I guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again (over again)
And I'll have to get over you all over again (never really over)
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again

[Verse 1]
You love the hell out of me
And Heaven's where we could be
I've stood on the edge of love
But never took the leap
And you took my armor off
And did it delicately
And I let my guard down
To show you what's underneath

[Pre-Chorus]
Thank God that you were man enough to come
Answer my mama's prayers
You asked the question, I said, "Yes"
But I'm scared

[Chorus]
'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"
I do

[Verse 2]
See us in sixty years with a full family tree (I do)
Give my blood, sweat, and tears to reach our destiny (I do)
'Cause love is a minefield, let's take this war, baby (I do)
'Cause at the end of it all, I choose you and you choose me (I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
Thank God I was woman enough to come
Answer your father's prayers
You asked the question
I could tell you were scared

[Chorus]
'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

[Bridge]
Now let's dance with each other (Dance with each other)
Mixing all of our colors
It's so easy to surrender
When you finally find forever

[Chorus]
No, I've never worn white, no
But I really wanna try with you
Yeah, I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

[Outro]
'Cause I do
Oh, I do, yeah, yeah

Ball so hard, since we here
It's only right that we be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to be go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tok
Audemars thats losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard, let's get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
Ball so hard, trip behave, Just might let you meet Ye
Chi towns D. Rose, I'm movin'the Nets to BK

[Verse 2]
She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard, ball so hard), That so cray, Ain't it K?
What she order,what she order?
Your whip so cold, (ball so hard) this old thing
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around muhfas like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fk ol girl she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French but I'm in France (I'm just sayin')
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
Cause if I was him I would have married Kate & Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louie my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest
Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in London
And they going gorillas!

[Hook]

Ooh, you are now watching the throne

[Snippet]
I won't, no, I won't apologize
I will not, will not subscribe
Don't ask me, ask me to normalize
       
[Verse 1]
The leaves were falling, I was seventeen
We'd been locking lips, grabbing hips, smoking cigarettes
We took a drive in your 1990 the hand me down
From out of town, I was California
Oh, my legs were not shaved
And you had dirt between your fingers
They told us to behave, but hey

[Chorus]
It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
It's nothing like the first time

[Verse 2]
I had seen it in the magazines
We would change the channel on the TV screen
'Cause it's such a sin what ya did to me
Straight to hell is what they sell if you done the deed
Oh, but what could be so bad?
Oh, if everyone is guilty
I guess we want what we can't have
'Cause I've heard...


[Chorus]
It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
It's nothing like the first time

[Bridge]
Do you remember? Do you remember?
Do you remember? Do you remember?
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time

[Chorus]
It's not a walk in the park
It's not a shot in the dark
It's not a juvenile crime
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like tying the knot
There's no connecting the dots
And in case you forgot
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time


[Outro]
It's not like reading a map (La la la la la la)
Oh ya, you give me laugh
There's nothing like the first time



[Verse 1]
He put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know when you know
I don't know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl
For even dreaming that I could?

[Chorus 1]
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah

[Verse 2]
Snow White said when I was young
"One day my prince will come"
So I wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half
So we make perfect shapes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If stars don't align, if it doesn't stop time
If you can't see the sign
Wait for it
One hundred percent, worth every penny spent
He'll be the one that finishes your sentences

[Chorus 2]
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, he'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, oh-oh yeah

[Bridge]
'Cause I know you're out there
And you're, you're looking for me
Oh-oh-oh
It's a crazy idea that
You were made perfectly for me, you see

[Chorus 3]
Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic, with the perfect ending, ohh
It's not like the movies, oh
But that's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, you'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginning




[Chorus]
It's not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's no funeral we're attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's not the end of the, no, not the end of the world

[Verse 1]
You can catch a star if the sky is falling down
There's a golden lining up in every single cloud
You can take a frown, turn it all the way around
All the way around, all the, all the way around
A fortune teller told me, "The power's in your mind"
You might see a cliff, but I see a way to fly
Flipping off the flop, now I just enjoy the ride
Just enjoy the ride, yeah, I just enjoy the ride

[Pre-Chorus]
(Na, na, na, na) What a time
(Na, na, na, na) To be alive
(Don't say goodbye)

[Chorus]
It's not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's no funeral we're attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's not the end of the, no, not the end of the world

[Verse 2]
You can make a wish even on a satellite
On a plastic lash or anything you like
You can tame the dragon if you're not afraid to fight
Not afraid to fight, no, I'm not afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
(Na, na, na, na) What a time
(Na, na, na, na) To be alive
(Don't say goodbye) Don't say goodbye

[Chorus]
It's not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's no funeral we're attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope

[Outro]
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Don't say goodbye
      
[Verse 1]
I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down
'Cause they just get in my way

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The way you look at me
Is kinda like a little sister
You high five your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

[Chorus 1]
So I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys

[Verse 2]
So over the summer, something changed
I started reading Seventeen and shaving my legs
And I studied Lolita religiously
And I walked right in to school and caught you staring at me


[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay, maybe one day
But not until you give me my diamond ring

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your homecoming queen
Pin up poster dream
Not one of the boys

[Bridge]
I wanna be a flower, not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses, not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna make out
Make out, make out with me
Don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys

[Intro]
Only love, only love
Only love, only love

[Verse 1]
Eighty-six thousand, four hundred seconds in a day
I swear lately most of 'em have been a waste
I feel 'em come and go, bury my mistakes
But time just goes on and on in a way

[Pre-Chorus]
If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, nah, nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead


[Post-Chorus]
Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love

[Verse 2]
I swear sometimes I hear myself talking, getting mad
Take shit so personal, like it really matters
Oh, am I awake, am I sleepwalking? Tell me that
It's scary how quickly I lose perspective and I react

[Pre-Chorus]
If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, no, nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead


[Post-Chorus]
Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love (No)
Yeah, give me
Only love, only love
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me (Mmm)
Only love, only love (Only love, only love)
Give me
Only love, only love (Only love, only love, only love)
Only love, only love (Oh, no, only love)
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me (Oh)
And take the love instead

[Outro]
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me
Only love, only love
Yeah, give me
Only love, only love

[Verse 1]
You don't have to look like a movie star
Ooh, I think you're good just the way you are
Tell me if you could would you up and run away with me?
You don't have to roll like a millionaire
Baby, I would go with you anywhere
We don't need no gold, we'll be shining anyway, we'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
You know can't nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'til we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'til the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got

[Chorus]
Ooh, my my baby, don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby, come with me and be my ooh la la
Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby, come with me and be my ooh la la

[Verse 2]
You don't have to wear no designer clothes
Just as long as we're dancing on the floor
Fingers in my hair and I'm letting go tonight, so free


[Pre-Chorus]
You know can nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'till we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got

[Chorus]
Ooh, my my baby, don't be shy

And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby, come with me and be my ooh la la



[Verse 1]
Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 2]
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me drown
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me

A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing, oh whoa

It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me

[Chorus]

But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no


This is the part of me
This is the part of me

[Verse 2]
Throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
(take away from me, take away from me...)

[Outro]
This is the part of me
This is the part of me, me, me...



[Intro]
This is the part of me
This is the part of me

[Verse 1]
Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 2]
Throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
(take away from me, take away from me...)

[Outro]
This is the part of me
This is the part of me, me, me...




[Verse 1]
I can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know don't way ahead of me
One day out a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
I can handle about it

[Chorus]
I let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn, but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
And we've seen more without a map
(Life this beautiful)
Without a map
(Life this beautiful)
Without a map
(Life this beautiful)
Without a map

[Verse 2]
So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I jumped and I got no regrets
You're my co-pilot and here, that's fine
Now I can just enjoy the ride

[Chorus]
I let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn
But, I know that I'm in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
And we've seen more without a map
(Life this beautiful)
Without a map
(Life this beautiful)
Without a map
(Life this beautiful)
Without a map

[Bridge]
I know we're finally falling in
Cause I was giving you help, now I'm all in
My hand in the air, flying proudly
Cause you're leaving, cause you're leaving
Cause you're leaving, cause you're leaving

[Chorus]
I let you leave the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would be
The road will twist and turn, but
I know that I'm in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
And we've seen more without a mess
(Like this beautiful)
Without a mess
(Like this beautiful)
Without a mess
(Like this beautiful)
Without a mess




[Verse 1]
I can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know the way ahead of me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
That I could hand over the keys

[Chorus]
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but

But we'll see more without a map (life is beautiful)
Without a map, without a map, without a map (life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful)

[Bridge]
I know we're finally falling
Cause I was giving you half no more than
My hand's in the air while you're driving
This is living, this is living, this is living
Oh it's beautiful, beautiful
Being with you, being with you

[Chorus]
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel

[Verse 1]
She is a pyramid
But with him, she's just a grain of sand
This loves too strong, like Mice and Men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in
She was a hurricane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with

[Pre-Chorus]
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

[Chorus 1]
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl

[Verse 2]
She was unstoppable
Move fast just like an avalanche
But now she's stuck deep in cement
Wishing that they never ever met

[Pre-Chorus]
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

[Chorus 1]
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a...

[Bridge]
Do you know that there's a way out?
There's a way out, there's a way out, there's a way out
You don't have to be held down
Be held down, be held down, be held down

[Breakdown]
'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world, my world, oh yeah!
But I woke up and grew strong and I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl

[Chorus 2]
You don't have to be a shell, no
You're the one that rules your world, oh
You are strong and you'll learn that you can still go on
And you'll always be a, a pearl

[Outro]
She is unstoppable




[Verse 1]
You got patina, ain't so green, nah
You earned this spot, got your receipts, yeah
Funny, gotta add addendums to your dreams
Still you never sleep, no
You never sleep, ah
Oh, you learned to dance, to bob and weave, yeah
To let that water roll off easy, yeah
You grew yourself above the weeds
Taller than the trees, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
So, don't try and reinvent your wheel
'Cause you're too original
Baby, just stay classic
Ain't broke, ain't broke, don't fix it
Your highs, your lows, just ride it

[Chorus]
It's a pendulum, it all comes back around
It's a pendulum, it's a pendulum
Life's a pendulum, it'll all come back around
It's a pendulum, it all comes back, it all comes back

[Verse 2]
So, just take those punches on the chin, yeah
Don't fight the changes in the wind, no, no
'Cause you'll find your way home, oh
If you find a way to let go
Just let go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try and reinvent your wheel (Your wheel)
'Cause you're too original (Original)
Baby, just stay classic
Ain't broke, ain't broke, don't fix it
Your highs, your lows, just ride it

[Chorus]
It's a pendulum, it all comes back around (Pendulum)
It's a pendulum (All comes back around), it's a pendulum
Life's a pendulum, it'll all come back around
It's a pendulum, it all comes back, it all comes back around

[Bridge]
And there is no need to worry, the pages keep on turning
And it goes on and on, comes all the way around
There is no need to hurry if there's a fire burning
'Cause it goes on and on, comes all the way around
All the way around
Hey, around
Oh (All the way around), c'mon
Ain't broke, ain't broke, don't fix it
Your highs, your lows, just ride it

[Chorus]
It's a pendulum, it all comes back around (Oh-oh)
It's a pendulum, it's a pendulum (Life is, life is)
Life's a pendulum, it'll all come back around (Hey)
It's a pendulum, it all comes back, it all comes back
It's a pendulum, it all comes back around (Oh-oh)
It's a pendulum (All comes back around), it's a pendulum

Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

ANNOUNCEMENT:

[Verse 1]
Living in fear
Is not what you had
In mind for me
But holding to you
Is so hard
I cling to what I see

[Pre-Chorus]
In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

[Chorus]
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You

[Verse 2]
Here in this haze a distant light
Seems to draw me near
But in the shadow of my doubt
My faith just disappears


[Pre-Chorus]
In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

[Chorus]
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You



You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over, there's some games you want to play
I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
Just me and you and you and me alone
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Ring around the rosy
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy, I want to give you, want to give you
What you need
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
You know I give a fuck about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't want to leave this play date with you




We can't keep playing house
With such a big world outside
How do we shut it out?
At a fork in the road
Should I stay or should I go?
I'll keep the cat
Leave a spare under the mat
If you need to crash one day

Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don't you think we're just too young
To play these grown up games?

Cause you know me too well
It'd be like me lying to myself
But I'm so scared to be alone
And go back to sleeping with the lights on

Cause I can be myself
Drunk or sober fat proactive poster
Wouldn't it be nice
If we were older
Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don't you think we're just too young
To play these grown up games

Some days I wanna take my chances
Not live so modernized
Some day I wanna be a Mrs
But it's not yet quite right
No it's not yet quite right

So there go our future children's names
I put the rest of us in a box in the closet
That I cannot open without getting full
Full of emotion
Because you know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you
You know I loved you

Cause I know we swore forever
But it seems so far away
Don't you think we're just too young
To play

One day I wanna take my chances
Not live so modernized
One day I wanna be a Mrs
But it's not yet quite right
No it's not yet quite right
No it's not yet quite right

So, so what, I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

[Part 8 - I Kissed a Girl]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Part 9 - Fireflies]
And I like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake
When I'm asleep
Because everything is never as it seems

[Verse 1]
I was fine before I met you
Truth is that I lost myself inside you
It is not fair to put all that on you
But you took control of a vulnerable soul (Yeah)
I am my mother's daughter
And there are so many things I love about her
But I have, I have to break the cycle
So I can sit first at the dinner table

[Chorus]
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power

[Verse 2]
Hell hath no fury like a woman reborn
And now I'm burning like a blue flame once more
But don't mistake my warmth for weakness
Don't bite the hand that feeds or you'll
You'll never eat, no-oh

[Chorus]
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power (Hey)


[Bridge]
And now I'm taking it back
Electric as fuck (C'mon)
You can't quiet this thunder, no (No-oh-oh)
Yeah, I'm taking it back
Lit all the way up
Even in the dark, I glow (I glow, I glow)

[Chorus]
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours, oh
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it

[Verse 1]
Twelve noon
Watch her sleeping in your room
Why can't that still be me?
Two o'clock and I'm still driving 'round your block
Feeling a little crazy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run, but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising
That look on your face

[Chorus 2]
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever

[Verse 2]
So weeks pass and I found myself another catch
Someone who loves me equally, yeah
The tables turn and you're not happy
When you learn he's moving in with me


[Pre-Chorus 2]
He bought me a big ring, we moved to the city
Now you won't stop calling
'Cause you always thought that you'd have your plan B
Now you're showing
Up at my place
Not surprising
We both play this game

[Chorus 2]
You're underneath my street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
You're right outside my window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever

[Bridge]
La la la la
La la la la
Forever
La la la la
La la la la

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run, but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising
That look on your face


[Chorus 1]
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love

[Verse 1]
You can only be strong for so long
Before everything just smashes
They will insult you, break you, hurt you
But they cannot destroy you

I no longer feared the darkness
Because the darkness, now fears me
The light will shine and everyone will see
From the ashes of my past
Like a phoenix, I will be

[Chorus]
Because I am standing, standing, and still standing
They will see me now as I am rising
Nothing to left, nothing to cling (oh)
I am reborn and I will keep burning

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of being desperate, sick of being alone
So I look up to the sky to try and find a home
The light will shine and everyone will see
From the ashes of my past
Like a phoenix, I will be

[Chorus]
Because I am standing, standing, and still standing
They will see me now as I am rising
Nothing to left, nothing to cling (oh)
I am reborn and I will keep burning


[Bridge]
I am a phoenix, I've been reborn  (oh yeah)
I am a phoenix, I've been resurrected
I am a phoenix, I've been reborn (oh yeah)
I am a phoenix, get ready to see me burn

[Chorus]
Because I am standing, standing, and still standing
They will see me now as I am rising
Nothing to left, nothing to cling (oh)
I am reborn and I will keep burning

[Post-Chorus]
I am reborn and I will keep burning
And keep burning


[Verse 1]
I know there's gotta be rain if I want the rainbows
And I know the higher I climb, the harder the wind blows
Yeah, I've gone to sleep night after night punching a pillow
But do you know the darker the night, the brighter the stars glow?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh no
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
You'll see me grow right through the cracks, yeah
'Cause you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracks

[Verse 2]
I've got to shed all the skin if I want the distance
Let the sun in, pull out the weeds and focus my vision
'Cause there's no mistakes, just bends and breaks and friction
But do you know the hotter the fire, the purer the gold is?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh yeah
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh


[Bridge]
'Cause I died every winter
But survived all the weather
Look at me now, look at me now
I'm in full bloom, yeah
They tried to poison the water
But I was a little stronger
Look at me now, look at me now
I light up the room, oh yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I am resilient (I am resilient)
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, no
Oh, I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh, you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracks

        
[Verse 1]
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Oh, ye of so little faith)
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(Victory is in my veins)
I know it, I know it
(And I will not negotiate)
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

[Chorus]
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time."
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise


[Verse 2]
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

(Victory is in your veins)
You know it, you know it

[Pre-Chorus 1: Dani]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

[Chorus: Christina]
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time."
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise


[Verse 2: Katherine]
I must stay conscious
Through all the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

[Pre-Chorus 2: Amy]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

[Chorus: Lisa]
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time."
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Outro: Amy & Lisa]
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You know it, you know it
You know it
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed



[Verse 1]
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
I will still rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise

[Verse 2]
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos

Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it

Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise

[Chorus]

They're whispering, "you're out of time."

[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, and  fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear that  voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground

Get ready 'cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust

You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)

[Verse 1]
Preacher man walked into the bar and he said
He said "Hey girl, can't you walk a mile straight?"
Father, I'm torn and I'm selling my soul
To the rhythm, the beat and the bass

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't confess my rock and roll ways
'Cause I'm so possessed with the music, the music he plays

[Chorus]
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god

[Verse 2]
Preacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said "Hey girl, can't you live your life right?"
Father, things aren't always so black and white
Don't cast the first stone 'cause I'm not alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's not like I'm hurting anyone
But I can't confess my rock, my rock and roll ways

[Chorus]
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum

[Verse 1]
I'm uptight
Playing by the rules in this game of life
365 days on the grind
Something's stirring, I might need to unwind
Then, there's you
Texting me a little bubble of trouble
I've tried to ignore these thoughts that rumble
I think I'm bored of being so careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go

[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 2]
They say everything in moderation
And sometimes, you got to give in to temptation
So I drop a pin to my location
Let's roll the dice

[Pre-Chorus]
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go

[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Oh, like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Bridge]
So tonight, we test limits (Test limits)
Take the safety off for a minute (For a minute)
'Cause my love's a bullet with your name written on it
Just load it and spin it

[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you (Close my eyes with you)
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you (Lose control, lose control)
Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Let's roll it)
Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Like roulette)
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette




[Verse 1]
I remember when you used to be my every other thought
But now my calendar's so full, it's easier to move on
Sometimes I swear I pass your SUV on Sunset Boulevard
I don't fuck with change, but lately, I've been flipping coins a lot

[Chorus]
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

[Verse 2]
You don't have to subtweet me
My number's always been the same
But all's been said and done
Will we ever really close this case?
Yeah, I will always be here for you, but I could no longer stay
Still my body goes in shock every time I hear your name

[Chorus]
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

[Bridge]
I've heard you've done some changing
I've been rearranging
Wish that I could know, but I just don't know
Never get that time back
Fear we'd fall in old traps
Why can't we just let go?
Staring at a fork in the fucking road

[Chorus]
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie (Dogs lie)
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

So break out the frame you're in
Find that adrenaline
Whatever advice you like
Just save me some tonight




[Intro: Jair Lestrange]
You're walking through
A lonely Street
Looking at the moon
It light up your ocean eyes
Please Save Me Some Tonight

[Verse 1: Jair Lestrange]
While you're walking
My eyes get you
They don't want to let you go
You're like a vital blow

[Pre-Chorus: Jair Lestrange]
You have all you want
The people watching us
We both think "fuck off"
While we're kissing
It seems that we are chained
We were made for each other

[Chorus: Jair Lestrange]
So break out the frame you're in
Find that adrenaline
Whatever advice you like
Just save me some tonight
Baby save me some tonight

[Verse 2: Jair Lestrange]
Baby let yourself love
Don't be afraid of feeling
Be my love
Your indifference is hitting
Like a Demon
Killing me, from the inside
Be my light
Light my way
Throw the hell
I'll go from you hand there

[Pre-Chorus: Jair Lestrange]
You have all you want
The people watching us
We both think "fuck off"
While we're kissing
It seems that we are chained
We were made for each other

[Chorus: Jair Lestrange]
So break out the frame you're in
Find that adrenaline
Whatever advice you like
Just save me some tonight
Baby save me some tonight

[Bridge: Jair Lestrange]
Don't let alone
Here in the darkness of my soul
I need you baby
By my side i need you
To heal the wound
That an "unconditional" love open up

[Pre-Chorus: Jair Lestrange]
You have all you want
The people watching us
We both think "fuck off"
While we're kissing
It seems that we are chained
We were made for each other

[Chorus X2: Jair Lestrange]
So break out the frame you're in
Find that adrenaline
Whatever advice you like
Just save me some tonight
Baby save me some tonight
       
[Verse 1]
Through this skin you see
My heart
Through this laughter you feel
My pain
Even through this mask you see
My face
For You are the only one who really knows just who I am

[Chorus]
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me

[Verse 2]
Growing up never comes
Easily
In Your hands, You're the potter
Molding me
Then why do I wear this mask and play this game
Of hide and seek
When You are the only one who really knows just who I am

[Chorus]
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are


[Bridge]
My Father, my Father
You are my Father, oh, and I am Your child
And you hear my cry, even at the midnight

[Chorus]
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
The mysteries of who You are
The mysteries of who You are

[Verse 1]
Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin?
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken, but my heart is still wide open

[Chorus]
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

[Verse 2]
With each scar, there's a map that tells a story
What a souvenir of young love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal wave of an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

[Chorus]
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to


[Bridge]
And I cover up these scars
(We'll make it, we'll make it, but we break it)
And I can't stop seeing stars
(Let's hope, not die)
Whenever you're around, around

[Chorus]
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

[Outro]
I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop
Oh, I'm going out in flames
Oh, I'm going down in flames
Ohh
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose



[Verse 1]
I will not philosophize about the meaning of life
Let's take no time 'cause the teasing isn't right
Let's skip the foreplay
We know were gonna do it anyway
Cause all I'm selling is...

[Hook]
Sex, sex
On your radio, selling is
Sex, sex
Just like a machine

[Verse 2]
Have you seen my video?
Look at me I'm dancing in slow-mo
And the ad campaign I'm bathing in champagne
Cause I'm a lady
Good for one thing maybe
And all I'm selling is...

[Hook 2]
Sex, sex
On your radio, selling is
Sex, sex
Just like a machine
A machine
Yeah, a machine
All I'm selling is
Sex baby
Sex baby, sex
On your radio, all I'm selling is
Sex
Just like a machine

[Bridge]
Will you be my sugar daddy if I promise to behave?
Then you can have me, but you'll be digging your own grave
Oh, it's not worth it, I've already done my circuit
All I'm selling is, all I'm giving is, all I'm selling is...

[Hook 2]
Sex, sex
On your radio, selling is
Sex, sex
Just like a machine
I'm selling it, sex
On your radio
I'm selling it, sex
Just like a machine

       
[Verse 1]
You're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey, sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You dont even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans, cause they are more distressed
So they say--you got O.C.D
And they claim you can barely read
But you say "Don't bother me with all of your reality"

[Chorus]
But it could be so simple
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

[Verse 2]
So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park in a loading zone
You sleep with the lights all on
You cross your i's and dot your t's
All it goes to show


[Chorus]
That it could be so simple
(You were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just that simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

[Verse 3]
I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to re-evaluate
The possibilities
The situations
The opportunities
That are waiting
Oh, the possibilities
Oh, I

[Chorus]
That it could be so simple
(You were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just that simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems


[Verse 4]
We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you listen please
And focus on life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems

[Outro]
It is all so simple
Just deal with it


I can read the lines
On your face and they're telling me
Everything I already know, yeah
I hold you in my arms
But you're light years away from me
Slowly sinking under, alone, yeah

So I act cool on the outside
But it's eating me alive

'Cause when it comes to you
There's nothing I can do
I can't make you love me when you don't
I see it in your eyes
I'm the compromise
No, I can't take another slow goodbye

Sitting in the park, after dark, smoking cigarettes
Biting all the black off of my nails
'Cause all I ever wanted was what you took away from me
Try to make it right, but it's too late

I'm a hopeless case on the inside
And it's eating me alive

'Cause when it comes to you
There's nothing I can do
I can't make you love me when you don't
I see it in your eyes
I'm the compromise
No, I can't take another slow goodbye


No, I die
A million times every time when you look me in the eye
And lie
'Cause I've heard it all before
The same game
We go around and around
But I still end up with nothing
But hurting

'Cause when it comes to you
There's nothing I can do
I can't make you love me when you don't
I see it in your eyes
I'm the compromise
No, I can't take another slow goodbye

No
There's nothing I can do (nothing I can do)
I can't make you love me when you don't
I see it in your eyes
I'm the compromise
No, I can't take another slow goodbye



[Verse 1]
Isn't it strange that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather, okay

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Yeah

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

[Verse 2]
Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers

Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

[Verse 1]
Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test

[Pre-Chorus]
But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

Gotta say it's really been a while

Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees (Oh, woah)
A Mona Lisa masterpiece (Now I'm)

Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'


[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

[Verse 2]
I'm 2.0, remodeled
Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees (Oh, woah)
A Mona Lisa masterpiece (Now I'm)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (C'mon, smile, woo)

Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while

I thought I told you that we won't stop

[Verse 3: Diddy & Katy Perry]
I gotta crack a smile, even laugh a while (That's right)
Been through a lot, but I ain't backin' down (Let's go)
See, I came in the game with the flashy style (Woo)
Now I'm looking at the wealth that I'm passin' down
I'ma seen the light, it's a pleasing sight
Girl, we even manifestin' when we sleep at night (Right)
Fell down couple times, now we reachin' heights (Ha)
Yeah, to be precise, I'ma lead the fight (Woo, let's go)
Been appointed, light on your life so anointing
Catch me two-steppin', nigga, stressin' is pointless
No need to worry 'cause the truth is here
And I'm smiling, bitch, with my new veneers, yeah (Oh no no no no)

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental outro]



[Intro]
*Phone rings*
Hello?
Hi, it's me, can I come over?

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I want a shot of your Novocaine
I think I found the switch that turns off the brain
Locate the black hole that I can jump right through

[Interlude]
'Cause my ears, they won't stop ringing
I won't stand another pick up line
Oh, my heart, it will stop beating
If I don't see you tonight

[Chorus]
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
These things I confess, they just lead to a dysfunctional love
Just don't hang up
Just, just don't hang up

[Verse 2]
Running away is not the solution
My head's not straight with all this pollution
Electronic gadgets add to the confusion


[Interlude]
So, are you on your own?
Or should I take a rain check?
Now am I going home?
Or will I cry my eyes out?

[Chorus]
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
These things I confess, they just lead to a dysfunctional love
Don't hang up

[Bridge]
There wouldn't be so much to say
If I wasn't in this all to stay
Is it too late
For us to communicate?

[Break]
I, I, I, speed dialin'
I, I, I, speed dialin'

[Chorus]
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much


[Outro]
Don't hang up
'Cause I want you way too much
Out of luck
Because you're too far for me to touch
Don't hang up
Because I need you way too much



[Verse 1]
I've never asked to define our time
It's understood
So crystal clear
When your eyes lock mine
We so connect
But we're almost scared of it
So no strings attached
Is where it's at..
For the moment

[Chorus]
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night (woah oh oh)
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I play cool
Like i've met a hundred yous
And for tonight
You're just right
To be the one I use
But you break me down
I forget the games I play
Oh you wrap me up
In your arms and I just.. melt away

[Chorus]
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night (Whoa, oh oh)
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night

[Bridge]
Oh if I could freeze this moment
In my heart shaped locket
Wear you around my neck
So you won't be forgotten
I would, I would
Oh if I could tell you everything
I feel for you baby
Spill my heart out on the floor
And have it be reciprocated
I would, you know I would

[Chorus]
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night (woah oh oh)
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Oh baby relax
Oh baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Undo my dress, let down my hair (Oh if I could freeze this moment in my heart shaped locket
And let's just wear you around my neck so you won't be forgotten
Spend the night, spend the night. I would, I would)
Woah oh oh




[Verse 1]
Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues
I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose

[Pre-Chorus]
Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

[Chorus]
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float

[Verse 2]
Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a Nirvana finally

[Pre-Chorus]
Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

[Chorus]
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float

[Interlude]
You make me float
You make me float

[Chorus]
This is spiritual, under your spell
So phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel (Like an angel), all aglow (Oh)
Like a feather (Like a feather), you make me float

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
You make me float
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, you make me float


[Verse 1]
If You came by me
Would I crown You my King
Or brush You off as though
I really didn't see
If You walked by my side
Would our souls then be unified
I swore Your name
Would never be denied

[Chorus]
But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by

[Verse 2]
But time and time again
I'd live that life of sin
I knew it hurt you bad
But I wasn't ready to give in
Maybe someday
But not this day I said
I wanted to live my life
I was willing to pay the price


[Chorus]
But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by
('Cause I'd forgotten those words
Your name won't be denied)

[Verse 3]
But looking into my eyes
I knew You felt this heart's cry
I needed You
Bad my life was oh so sad
But looking back at all this pain
This guilt, this strife
Would You take it all away
If I were to give you back my life?

[Bridge]
But You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee


[Verse 4]
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head

[Outro]
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee

Whistlin' and tryin' to flirt with me
Don't take this personally

It doesn't really matter who you say you are
Singin' out the window of your car
Find another girl across the bar
'Cause L-O-V-E's not what this was

I can be my own hero

Like a daisy, I will bloom
My self-love will take
Up so much room

You should be proud of who
You are
You are an original and
You cannot be replaced

Let's walk down the yellow-brick
Road, together

Your smile brightens the
Darkest place

Be the angel you're meant to be
You're in this world because you
Can make a difference in our lives
Just be who you are-re

I am a sunny gaze (sunny gaze)
Sunny gaze

With or without makeup
You're perfect as you are
Don't hide yourself in the
World
You know that you can make a
Difference in our lives
Just be who you are-re

Your smile brightens the
Darkest place

Be the angel you're meant to be

I am a sunny gaze (sunny gaze)
Sunny gaze

Sticks and stones may break
Your bone
But your inside can never be
Broken (ho ho)

I am a sunny gaze (sunny gaze)
Sunny gaze

You can be whoever you
Wanted to be
Don't be ashamed of
Who you are;
You're original and
You cannot be replaced

I am a sunny gaze (sunny gaze)
Sunny gaze

People like you, people like me
We want to be ourselves

And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan

[Verse 1]
See the people, they are driving in their cars
Driving in their cars, driving in their cars tonight
And all the people, they all walking out of bars
Getting in their cars, driving in their cars tonight
And everybody's leaving, a million brakes are screeching
No one knows where they're going to

[Chorus]
And I just wanna fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
And I just wanna fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love

[Verse 2]
See the people, they are rolling in their cars
Cruising in their cars, driving in their cars tonight
See the people, they are driving in their cars
Driving in their cars, driving in their cars tonight
And all the people, they are jingling their keys
Standing at the doors, getting in their cars tonight
The scene was great, I'm moving, the radio was grooving
And everybody likes the same songs

[Chorus]
And I just wanna fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
And I just wanna fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love
Take a walk and fall in love

[Intro]
What are you lookin' at?
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I saw this coming from a mile away
I saw a crack in the egg
A little rip in the page
I found your necklace on the floor
(Breathing)
Underneath the bed
Where you said
I was the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
You thought I'd cry
(You-thought-I'd-cry)
You thought I'd lay down and die
You thought there's no getting over you
(Ha-ha)
And all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having your fun
I've been having some fun too

[Chorus]
Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
But the knife is in your back
(In-your-back)


[Verse 2]
You left your suit, you left your tie
And looked me in the eye
And swore that it was business baby
(Yeah, right)
And when you left I got a call
That started it all
And now it's not your business ba-by

[Pre-Chorus]
You thought I'd cry
(You-thought-I'd-cry)
You thought I'd lay down and die
You thought there's no getting over you
(Ha-Ha)
But all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having your fun
I've been having some fun too

[Chorus]
Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
(I'd-lie-here)
But the knife is in your back
(In-your-back)


[Verse 3]
You're such a wreck
The cutest accident
Makes so much sense
You'll come back to me, oh
(Ahh)

[Bridge]
And I'll let you
Hey
Huh
You're back

[Chorus]
Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think i'd lie here, heartbroken
(I'd-lie-here)
But the knife is in you're back
(In-your-back)
Cause' it takes one, to know one
(Hi, nice to meet you)
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here heartbroken
(I'll-lie-here)
But the knife is in your back
(In-your-back)



[Verse 1]
Have you ever lost, lost the light in your life?
Have you ever left, left yourself behind?
Have you ever lied and just replied "I'm fine"?
'Cause I can see you've lost, lost the light in your life

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna run like your mascara
Wine-stained lips talkin' to the mirror
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

[Chorus]
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

[Verse 2]
If love has left you with, with a question mark
If trust has left you fallin' in nobody's arms

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna hide like your emotions
Heart can't break, it's already broken
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

[Chorus]
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Keep on dancin' (Oh)

[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Yeah, that's more like it
It's great to be the last one laughing
That's more like it
That's more like it
That's more like it, that's more like it

[Bridge]
I like chocolate
And I like daisies
Maybe you better write this down
I love cashmere, and I want diamonds
Ready for my massage right now
Oh, right now

[Chorus]
That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner, bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, it's about time
Get to work and give me money
That's more like it
That's more like it
That's more like it, that's more like it
(That's more like it, that's more like it)
(Yeah, that's more like it)
(Yeah, that's more like it)


[Verse 1]
I took advantage of you
A stepping stone to my pedestal
When you had enough of it
I said 'Fine, good luck replacing this'
Cause I seem strong and independent
Self sufficient, confident
And I'm like Mercury rising to the top so selfishly

[Chorus]
The better half of me was you
I'm like a hive without a bee without you
I gotta find you, gotta remind you
That two is better than one

[Verse 2]
So please accept my apology
Cause I'm feeling like a branch without its tree
It took me a fall to really see
That you're the catch I want to keep
Cause I get weak thinking about you
Living without you life has no value
Baby, come back to me
Cause you're the only missing piece

[Chorus]
Cause the better half of me was you
I'm like a hive without its bee without you
I gotta find you, gotta remind you
That two is better than one


[Bridge]
Ooh, it took a little earthquake
To appreciate the stability you've given me so consistently
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
The better half of me was you
I'm like a bird without its wings, without you
I gotta find ya, gotta remind you
That two is stronger than one
The better half of me, oh it's you
I'm like a heart without its beat without you
I've gottafind ya, gotta remind you
I promise you that I'm going to try to
I'm gonna love you because two is better than one



[Verse 1]
After twelve, not so well
Won't pretend it's too soon to tell what's around this bend
No disgrace about face
Anything not to have to chase you down again

[Pre-Chorus]
You know nothing hurts like losin'
When you know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosin' to hold too long

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

[Verse 2]
A lot to say, but not today
Let the radio break the silence as we drive
A kiss goodbye, not this time
Don't remember what about this song I ever liked

[Pre-Chorus]
You know nothing hurts like losin'
When you know I'm already gone
Except for the pain of choosin' to hold too long

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

[Bridge]
I thought maybe we were gettin' somewhere
But we're still nowhere at all
I watch your tail lights fading
I try, but a tear won't fall
I remember what it feels like
To know love and have it taken away
Can't think of what I've learned right now
But I'll be thanking you someday

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
You know it's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

[Outro]
Let the credits start to roll
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road, be the end of the road
Will be the end of the road, be the end of the road




[Verse 1]
Remember last summer
Under the shooting stars?
We made a wish were together forever
And let nobody tear us apart
And how fun was that ride down to Mexico?
We took a chance on those road side tacos
And we got sick by the side of the road

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And the fall came
And we had that big pot lot party;
And your little sixteen year old brother
Spilt wine all over my carpet
And I got mad, you thought it was funny
I stayed mad all winter;
It's so sad
A thing like that
Becomes such a splinter

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll

[Verse 2]
I'm almost twenty-three
And I'm barely hanging on
I can't keep crashing couches
And going to sleep at dawn
And when were you going to take me somewhere that I can dress up?
Where we can act grown up
Do you ever wanna clean up?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We share a car, you thought it was okay
You couldn't have cut it closer
I'm sick of it, this is it;
And now the party's over

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same, and
The story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll

[Bridge]
Someday, you'll make, some girl, happy;
I know, you'll get though
You'll know, just what, to say, to do;
Because I showed you

[Chorus]
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll

[Outro]
Let the credits start to roll
Oh, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah
Oh, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
I guess the driveway; will be the end of the road

[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay

You were the one that got away

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
You know it's crazy, cause nights like this
Would start out with a little private party
You sneak me in your mom's house
I know I mighta spilled my drink, but
Really wasn't tryin' to spill my heart out
I mean it started as a conversation
I was really tryin' to get my thoughts out
But then we make moves and we make plans
Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills I'd figure the job out
And you knew I had to say it, but them day's gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong

[Verse 4: B.o.B]
I'm falling for you like dominoes
From the top of the hundredth floor
Look out below Geronimo
Tryin' to get behind the closed doors to your soul
Why'd you have to end the show
We had such a beautiful plot
There was still more story to go
Now look, I'm not insinuating that
You're some type of fair weather player
But even if the whole world falls over
I wouldn't be aware of a glacier
I just wanna see you wake up
Doing your hair in the mirror with your makeup
Then, maybe in the next lifetime we could make up

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away

Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world

'Cause all this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world

[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Verse 1]
Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you

Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

[Verse 2]
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test


[Pre-Chorus 2]
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth (I taste your mouth), oh
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

Oh, I wish that I was looking into your

And yes, I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
(Thinking of you, thinking of you)

Oh, I wish that I was looking into your, your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through
And bust in the door and take me away?
Oh, no more mistakes

And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night

Always say we're going to stop-op, oh woah

[Verse 1]
Can you tell me, who called a race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can't push rewind

[Chorus]
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

[Verse 2]
Do you ever think that, we're just chasing our tails?
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize
But you know who I, who I think will win
Are the ones that let love in
Are the ones that take the time


[Chorus]
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?

[Bridge]
Be here with me now
Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment

Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment

Part II: Love Me

[Verse 1]
I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me


[Bridge]
No more standing in my own way
(Let's get deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way
(The way I want you to love me)
No more standing in my own way
(Let's get deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way
(The way I want you to love me)

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be

[Verse 1]
I've played the song, now it drives me crazy
I've run the race, now I'm too damn lazy
This love of ours is so sad, it makes me laugh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Today seems a little different
Hard to say, but it looks like the end

[Chorus]
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes, nothing changes?
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train, we wait for it
Even when it's gone

[Verse 2]
We've surfed the wave, now we've hit the shore, and
We've squeezed the fruit 'til there's no more juice left
We're both so good, good at keeping up the lie


[Pre-Chorus 2]
We can get it in perspective
Kiss my lips, life is what we make it

[Chorus]
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes, nothing changes?
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train, we wait for it
Even when it's gone

[Bridge]
As I'm waving you goodbye, I want you to smile
Save the picture in your frame, file it right next to my name
I'm willing to die for love, willing to try, but not willing to lie for love
I know that this cake's already baked, now it's burning, burning

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We can get it in perspective
Kiss my lips, life is what we make it

[Chorus]
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut (Oh, yeah)
Didn't you know if nothing changes, nothing changes?
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
(Even when it's gone, even when it's gone)
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train, we wait for it


[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Even when it's gone, even when it's gone
If nothing changes, nothing changes
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
(Even when it's gone, even when it's gone)
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train, we wait for it
Even when it's gone

[Verse 1]
I've played the song
Now it drives me crazy
I've run the race
Now I'm too damn lazy
This love of ours
Is a fading photograph
Yeah-heah, yeah-heah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now am I supposed to
Laugh today
Seems a little different
Hard to say
But it looks like the end

[Chorus]
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it
Even when it's gone


[Verse 1]
We've surfed the wave
Now we've hit the shore
And we've squeezed the fruit
Till there's no more juice left
We're both so good
Good at keeping up the lie
Yeah-heah, yeah-heah

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey but no one's got to
Die, we can
Get it in prospective
Kiss my lips
Life is what we make it

[Chorus]
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it
Even when it's gone


[Bridge]
As I'm waving you goodbye
I want you to smile
Save a picture in your frame
File it right next to my name

I'm willing to die
For love willing to try
But not willing to lie for love
I know that this cake's already baked
Now its burning, burning

We can
Get it in prospective
Kiss my lips
Life is what we make it

[Chorus]
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes
Time's up
(even when it's gone)
Promise this time I'm getting off
(even when it's gone)
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it
Yeah yeah yeah
Even when it's gone
Even when it's gone
If nothing changes
Nothing changes
Time's up
(even when)
Promise this time I'm getting off

Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it
Even when it's gone

California Girls

[Intro: Katy Perry & Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
Yeah, the one, uh huh
Baby, you're a California girl

Teenage Dream

[Verse: Katy Perry]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Bridge: Katy Perry]
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
You...

California Girls

[Verse: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh

The One That Got Away

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Interlude: Katy Perry]
The one, the one, the one

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)

[Verse: Katy Perry]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
This a hickie or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
But this Friday night, do it all again
This Friday night, do it all again

[Outro: Katy Perry]
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F

E.T

[Verse: Katy Perry]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Firework

[Verse: Katy Perry]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

[Intro]
How could I see you when I was so blind?
How could I grasp you when I was far behind?
How could I hear you when I was so deaf?
How could I get up when I had been left?

[Chorus]
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me

[Bridge]
How could I be clean when I was so dirty
How could I be made whole when I was torn apart
Make me whole, make me whole
Make me whole again

[Chorus]
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me




[Verse 1]
Sometimes, talking gets you in a mess, you know
You think you're saying more when you're saying less, you know
Too many words

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you come and read my shirt, it says
"If love's the answer, what is the question?"
Who cares? We just made a connection

[Chorus]
Do you like my t-shirt?
Do you like what it says?
Don't have to say nothing
To get in your head
Do you like my t-shirt?
Mine says this, yours says whatever
If you like my t-shirt
Oh, let's get together
Together

[Verse 2]
Way too noisy here in this club, you know
And you can't hear me speak
So I just shut up, you know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's too much work, so come and read my shirt
It says, "The world's not perfect"
But this is perfection
Don't speak and we made the connection

[Chorus]
Do you like my t-shirt?
Do you like what it says?
Don't have to say nothing
To get in your head
Do you like my t-shirt?
Mine says this, yours says whatever
If you like my t-shirt
Oh, let's get together
Together

[Bridge]
Alternative for a communication
Just to be used by us
Yes, we could rule the world
With unspoken words
Mine says now, yours says forever
Looks like we might get together

[Chorus - Variation]
Do you like my t-shirt?
Do you like what it says?
You don't have to say nothing
To get in my head
Mine says this, yours says whatever
If you like my t-shirt
Make the connection

[Chorus]
Do you like my t-shirt?
Do you like what it says?
Don't have to say nothing
To get in your head
Do you like my t-shirt?
Mine says this, yours says whatever
If you like my t-shirt
Oh, let's get together
Together

[Outro]
Let's get together
Together
Let's get together
Together




[Verse 1]
Please don't tip-toe
Come close, let's flow
Anchor in me, and get lost at sea
The world's your oyster and I am the pearl
Open waters
Sink into me slowly

[Chorus]
So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

[Verse 2]
Don't fight
Just ride the rhythm of the tide
We swirl, we spin
Salted, sun-kissed skin
We float together
Whatever weather
Embrace the breeze and sail away smoothly

[Chorus]
So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

[Bridge]
Oh, you're waking up an ocean of emotion
That my body can't hide (Can't hide)
Tsunami (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now you're soaked in my devotion
'Cause you opened up a paradise (Inside)
Tsunami (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tsunami

[Chorus]
So baby, come and take a swim with me (Take a swim with me)
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy (Make me ripple, baby)
Don't be scared to dive in deep (Don't be scared to)
And start a tsunami
Tsunami




[Verse 1]
No one knows, knows where my mind goes
I keep you on the low, I must confess
I've been painting us, the picture makes me blush
My imagination at its best

[Pre-Chorus]
I could put us on an island
I could put us in a mansion
I could put us in a back seat, yeah
You're anywhere I want you to be

[Chorus]
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked

[Verse 2]
Tucked deep, deep in my fantasy
'Cause, in reality, we're a mistake
Don't need permission to do what I do to you
When all you are to me's a sweet escape

[Pre-Chorus]
I could put us on an island
I could put us in a mansion
I could put us in a back seat, yeah
You're anywhere I want you to be

[Chorus]
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked

[Bridge]
I'll keep you
Yeah, I'll keep you, baby
No one knows, knows where my mind goes
I keep you on the low, I must confess
You're someone that I should forget
Oh, woah, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby (Anytime, anytime, anytime)
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked

[Intro]
Your mind may refuse to believe
Your mind may refuse to believe

[Verse 1]
I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

[Chorus]
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like...

[Verse 2]
You're so sad, maybe you should buy a happy meal
You're so skinny, you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you out of your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup
And

You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

I know you know my boyfriend is out of town
So have a drink, let's talk it over
So many things I shouldn't be saying now
You know, I like my boys a little bit older

[Chorus]
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

All my girls are nowhere to be found
They all split when I'm in trouble
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around
The undercover lovers under the covers

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Trying to stop my head from spinning
Too much to drink, not making sense
It's been a while since I've been with someone new
That I can't stop the way I'm feeling

As you leave, please could you just close the door
Now that our love affair is over
You're exactly what I was looking for
We'll find a shoulder to cry upon

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night

But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me

Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now

That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Verse 2]
Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Bridge]
You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S
And get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
You told me
You told me, yeah

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas


[Outro]
Oh yeah
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter, yeah
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby
Woah, oh, yeah

[Outro]
Thank you!

Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air

You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy
Yeah, you take me to utopia
You're reading me like erotica
Boy, you make me feel exotic, yeah

We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there

You look so funny to me
When you pretend to be something you could never be
You try to make us think you live a tough life
But you've got your daddy's money so you'll always get by
There's a little bit of hip missing from you're hop
You're from beverly hills stop pretending you're not
You're the full ten baby all of the way
You will never be south central LA

Got your Air Force Ones and your Sean John jeans
Way too big hanging down to your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with the "what up G's"
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

You've got your twenty inch rims bouncin' up to the club
If you're not keepin' it real you're gonna get no love
Never seen the streets, never smelled them once
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

We all know you've got it made
Drive around town in you're escalade
No matter how you fight to fix it right
You're just a trust fund baby on the inside
I'll admit for me life hasn't been too tough
I've got my own problems but they ain't that rough
You can act the part you can wear the clothes
You can talk the talk everybody knows
Everybody knows yeah...

Got your Air Force Ones and your Sean John jeans
Way too big hanging down to your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with the "what up G's"
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

You've got your twenty inch rims bouncin' up to the club
If you're not keepin' it real you're gonna get no love
Never seen the streets, never smelled them once
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

Just hanging with your homies, out on a Friday night
Turn up the bass it's time to ride
Now don't forget the shorties all up in the club tonight
Time for you to show me all you're ice ice
Baby boy

Got your Air Force Ones and your Sean John jeans
Way too big hanging down to your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with the "what up G's"
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be

You've got your twenty inch rims bouncin' up to the club
If you're not keepin' it real you're gonna get no love
Never seen the streets, never smelled them once
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be       


[Verse 1]
Don't like it when you call me precious
Coming out it sounds so vicious
Don't like it when you're sympathizing
With your eyes so patronizing

[Pre-Chorus]
Never say never
You never thought
I wouldn't need you
And neither did I

[Chorus]
No more codependence
No more mending fences
It all leads to bad dreams
Now I'm wide awake
No more psycodrama
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me
I wash my hands clean
Watch me walk away

[Verse 2]
Sorry I don't have a tissue
For all your pathetic issues
Sorry I don't feel so sorry
When you touch me
You're in such a hurry

[Pre-Chorus]
Never say never
You never thought
I wouldn't leave you
And neither did I

[Chorus]
No more codependence
No more mending fences
It all leads to bad dreams
Now I'm wide awake
No more psycodrama
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me
I wash my hands clean
Watch me walk away

[Bridge]
No more no more
Watch me walk away
No more no more
Watch me walk away
No more no more
Watch me walk away
Just watch me walk away
Watch me walk away
There's nothing you can say, no more
Just watch me walk away

[Outro]
No more codependence
No more mending fences (Watch me walk away)
It all leads to bad dreams (No more)
Now I'm wide awake
No more psycodrama (Watch me walk away)
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me
I wash my hands clean
Just watch me walk away
Watch me walk away
Watch me walk away




[Verse 1]
I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me

[Verse 2]
Give them no reason to stare
No slippin' up if you slip away
So I got nothing to share
No, I got nothing to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned, yeah
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

[Chorus]
On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving back at me?
(Back at me, back at me)

[Verse 3]
We start with stars in our eyes (Stars in our eyes)
We start believing that we belong (We belong)
But every sun doesn't rise (The sun doesn't rise)
And no one tells you where you went wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned, yeah
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

[Chorus]
On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for the answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window, oh, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving?

[Bridge]
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in the forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in the  forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
It's like I never made a sound
Will I ever make a sound?

[Chorus]
On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving back at me?
(Back at me, back at me)

[Outro]
Is anybody waving? (Is anybody waving?)
Waving, waving, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
We're looking in the same direction
But you don't see what I see
Just a half moon in your perception
It looks full to me
Oh my head is caught, caught in clouds
But your buried so, so far down

[Chorus]
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way your pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down

[Verse 2]
Your words can pollute the future
So you should choose carefully
Cynical is a natural born killer
If it were up to me I would say
Lets get you all medicated
So we can get dedicated

[Chorus]
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down


[Bridge]
This is not a race
This is the relationship
But you take the cake at being the worst in it
Try and keep me grounded
You took my faith and nearly drowned it
This is not a test
This is the relationship
You are the best in being Mr. Negative
(You weigh me down)

[Chorus]
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down


[Outro]
You weigh me down (me down)



[Verse 1]
Crazy that the world is round
And we have our upside downs
And it's more than a miracle
That I even met you
Crazy how I went on dates
For you to say the words you say
And sometimes it's the little things that
That come to get you

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the distance
Baby, maybe you can save me
This is real love, real love
I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love

[Chorus]
Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life and never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life but never, ever let go now
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Save me when I rip the cord
And hang on so I don't get bored
And pull me when I kiss the ground
It's so nice to know you
Go 'head, you can chase the light
Kick back when it gets too bright
'Cause my world is another world
I'd, I'd like to show you

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love

[Chorus]
Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life and never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life but never, ever let go now
No, no

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love

[Chorus]
Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life and never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life but never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me


[Verse 1]
Is it the way I talk sweet?
The way my skin is soft?
Or how I can be a bitch?
Make you keep your fingers crossed?
Is it the way that I praise you?
The way that I please you?
Or how fast I change my mind
And get scared that I might leave you?

[Chorus]
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me

[Verse 2]
Is it the way I cut my hair
And put no makeup on?
I feel most beautiful
Doing what the fuck I want
Is it that my intuition
Is never really off?
I need tissues for my issues
And Band-Aids for my heart


[Chorus]
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
That's what makes a woman to me
Oh, oh (Oh yeah, yeah-yeah)
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Is it the way we keep
The whole world turning
In a pair of heels?
Yeah, that's what makes a woman
(There it is, Katheryn)

[Verse 1]
When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
When there's nothing left to say
I'll say it all again, but until then

[Chorus]
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, 'cause I do, Jesus

[Verse 2]
No music to play so I sing you my own song
Come on and sing along
When there's nothing that remains
You still stay the same
You're looking so strong

[Chorus]
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, 'cause I do, Jesus

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus]
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, 'cause I do, sweet Jesus

[Bridge]
When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before

[Outro]
I'm gonna give you my heart
I'm gonna give you my heart

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas with you
Jingle Bells
All the way, all the way

[Intro]
Yeah-eh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I can feel a Phoenix inside of me
As I march alone to a different beat
Slowly swallowing down my fear
Yeah, yeah
I am ready for the road less traveled
Suiting up for my crowning battle
This test is my own cross to bear
But I will get there

[Pre-Chorus]
It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

[Chorus]
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

[Verse 2]
I can feel this light that's inside of me
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning
I know one spark will shock the world, yeah yeah
So I pray for favor like Esther
I need your strength to handle the pressure
I know there will be sacrifice
But that's the price


[Pre-Chorus]
It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

[Chorus]
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

[Refrain]
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?

[Bridge]
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Oh-oh-oh, yeah


[Chorus]
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

[Refrain]
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?



[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer]
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Verse 1: John Mayer]
My girl, she isn't the one
I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
Because I've fought against it hard enough to know

[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer]
That you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
My boy ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time
But you should see him when he shines
You never want to let that feeling go

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry & John Mayer]
When you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Yeah, you love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer & Katy Perry]
Oh you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Outro: Katy Perry]
It's who you love
Who you love
Who you love
Who you love
You're the one I love


[Intro]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart (I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong? (I'm wide awake)
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

[Chorus]
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine


[Verse 2]
I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend (And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

[Chorus]
Falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine (I'm wide awake)

[Bridge]
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on (I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore


[Interlude]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
You know, I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine

I was falling hard with an open heart
I'm wide awake, how did I read the stars so wrong?

I'm wide awake, and now it's clear to me
That everything you see ain't always what it seems
I'm wide awake, yeah I was dreaming for so long

I'm wide awake (Seeing the bright side)


[UNIQUE (with JAKE)]
But I'm not (blind anymore)

[JAKE & TINA]
(I'm wide awake)

[KITTY]
I'm falling from cloud nine

[UNIQUE]
(It was out the blue, I)

[JAKE & TINA]
Crashing from the high

[KITTY & JAKE]
You know I'm letting go tonight

[UNIQUE]
(Yeah I'm ready to go, I)

[JAKE & TINA]
I'm falling from cloud nine

[KITTY, JAKE, UNIQUE & TINA]
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart
I'm wide awake
How did I read the stars so wrong

I'm wide awake
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete


Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
I'm falling from cloud nine

I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
Picked up every piece
And landed on my feet
I'm wide awake
Need nothing to complete myself, no

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And it's too late
The story's over now, the end

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete


Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling
I am trying to hold on
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side
But I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Verse 1]
I saw you at the grocery store
Oh you both looked happy
Picking out the usual
She's a carbon copy
Of everything you lost, of everything I'm not
I guess you just forgot how to pick 'em

[Verse 2]
If she's the one I've heard about
I'm disappointed
If she's the reason why you left
I'm not impressed at all
Well this looks like the end
Yeah, I hope we can still be friends
Congratulations

[Chorus]
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again

[Post-Chorus]
And again
And again
And again

[Verse 3]
Well, someone had to tell the truth
And I'm always honest
I read you like an open book
And it's obvious to me
She's just the one between, heading no where fast
Sure it's gonna last forever

[Chorus]
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again

[Outro]
And again
And again
And again
Oh, you wish
You wish
You wish
You do




[Verse 1]
If I lost it all today, would you stay?
Could my love be enough to stimulate?
If shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up and eventually laugh?
Roll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Will you be my witness? (Witness)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Verse 2]
When you tell me everything, and there's no holes
You can scroll through anything, you've got the codes
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes
And we just know, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

Looking for a witness to get me through this

(Through this, through this, through this, through this)

[Bridge]
Will you be my witness?
Could you be the one that speaks for me?
Will you be my witness?

Would my love be enough to stimulate?
Shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up beneath and eventually laugh?

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I gave myself a life
I gave myself a life
Oh, I gave myself a life

[Instrumental]


[Verse 1]
Get used to it, Katy
Everyone trashes you under the table
As they're smiling at your face
Cruel words like a stun gun
Life can be hum drum
Knock to the ground, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But if you got them talking
Staring and stalking
You know it's working
But you only get a minute or two

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody hates you
Are you aware?
You're just one note in a symphony
Nobody needs you
Nobody's there
Your name won't go down in history
Live on in infamy
But to the point
Would you care?
Would you care, would you care?


[Verse 2]
Get used to it, Katy
People's attention
Sure is focused on you
Your the subject of the day
They need something to speak about
No need to freak out
Tomorrow is over

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Today you got them talking
Staring and stalking
You knew it's working
But you only get a minute or two

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody hates you
Are you aware?
You're just one note in a symphony
Nobody needs you
Nobody's there
Your name won't go down in history
Live on in infamy
But to the point
Would you care?


[Bridge]
Mean worlds, mean words, mean thoughts, meanwhile
Don't let it get to you
Girl, don't cry, they lie
Don't let it get to you
Get used to it

[Breakdown]
Nobody hates you
Are you aware?
You're just a note in a symphony
Nobody needs you
Nobody's there
Nobody, nobody, nobody

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody hates you
Are you aware?
You're just one note in a symphony
Nobody needs you
Nobody's there
Your name won't go down in history
Live on in infamy
But to the point
Would you care?
But to the point
Would you care?
Would you care, would you care?

[Verse 1]
Everything comes around again
The circus returns to town again
Oh no, oh yeah
Now you are at my door again
Crawling around my floor again, oh yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause your love is gone and
You're all alone and you miss me
But you didn't miss me when
I was all alone, you're back 'cause you know
I can't help but love you
I can't help but kiss you
I can't help but let you in
I'm off to the slaughter and off to the lifehole
Right back to where we began

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause your love has gone and
You're on your own 'cause you miss me
La la la la la la
You just press rewind, we go back in time

[Verse 2]
Everything comes around again
What goes up will come down again
Oh no, oh yes
Wearing your old white dress again
Making my head a mess again


[Chorus]
'Cause your love is gone and
You're all alone and you miss me
But you didn't miss me when
I was all alone, you're back 'cause you know
I can't help but love you
I can't help but kiss you
I can't help but let you in
I'm off to the slaughter and off to the lifehole
Right back to where we began

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause your love has gone and
You're on your own 'cause you miss me
La la la la la la
You just press rewind, we go back in time

[Chorus]
'Cause your love is gone and
You're all alone and you miss me
But you didn't miss me when
I was all alone, you're back 'cause you know
I can't help but love you
I can't help but kiss you
I can't help but let you in
I'm off to the slaughter and off to the lifehole
Right back to where we began


[Outro]
Can't help but love you
Can't help but kiss you
Can't help but let you in
You miss me, you miss me
Your love has gone and you're all alone
You miss me, you miss me, you miss me
Oh yeah yeah yeah
