Why you acting like you don't care?
I been down since day one

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused
Boy, you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
'Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Why you acting like that? (Ooh, ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
(Why you acting like that?)
(Ooh, ooh)
Why you acting like that? (Ooh, ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
When I leave I'm taking off


[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Baddest bitch in the world right here
You ain't even gotta go nowhere
Boy, you better watch the way you walk
'Cause if you trip you're gonna fall, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused
Boy, you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
'Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Iggy Azalea]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Why you acting like that? (Ooh, ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
(Why you acting like that?)
(Ooh, ooh)
Why you acting like that? (Ooh, ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that? (Iggy, Iggy, Iggy, Iggy, Iggy, Iggy)
When I leave I'm taking off


[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Oh, well shit, she ain't me (Never)
My love cost too, baby, ain't nothing free (Nah)
Check my angle, daddy, you could call me angel, daddy (Uh)
But you gon' turn your beauty right into a beast (Uh)
Now, this is the business or pleasure, let's keep 'em separate (Separate)
I ain't tryna be second, just for the record (Record)
I see you slippin' you trippin', thought I should let you know
I admire your effort but I need better love
See many men try to play me 'til they get scared away (Right)
I told 'em that's a fall, try out another day (Right)
This is different, now I'm seeing that it isn't (Mmm)
Promise I'm not gon' cry here like Mary J
Now ain't that funny, that you was something special 'til
I noticed that you just like these losers who come in severals
But I, know that if you leave you comin' right back
So my question boy is, why you acting like that?

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused
Boy, you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
'Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned


[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Why you acting like that? (Ooh, ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
(Why you acting like that?)
(Ooh, ooh)
Why you acting like that? (Ooh, ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
When I leave I'm taking off

[Verse 1]
Like an angel, out the sky you came
Clearing up all the clouds, the sadness and the rain
So pure and healing was the love you bring
I knew inside it felt so right

[Pre-Chorus]
For me, I've struggled all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you, it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

[Chorus]
I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
Again, again

[Verse 2]
I was scared to let go and trust your love
After what I've been through, I have had enough
Whispering through your eyes, you never said a word
But something said, "You're insane"

[Pre-Chorus]
For me, I've struggled all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you, it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

[Chorus]
I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
Again, again

[Verse 3]
A friend is what you'll always have in me
I'm so grateful for the man you turned out to be
And it doesn't matter who you happen to meet
You'll forever be a sacred part of me

[Chorus]
I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
Again, again




[Intro]
Estoy
Loca
Enamorada
De ti

[Verse 1]
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind)
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance (Ooh)
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be (Never be)
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me (Ooh)
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about (You're about)
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt (Ooh)
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Bridge]
I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be (Ooh)
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life  (Oh, yeah)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No, no)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart? (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even though you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?

[Intro: Ja Rule]
Murda Inc, haha

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
It must be the ass that got me like damn
If they get any fatter, man, the Rule going to have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the L-O, hello
No, I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald
I'm the Rule and I shot call
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny?
It's been a while since you came around
Now you want to see what's going down
Tryna tell me why you want my time
Tryna tell me how I'm on your mind (On your mind)
See, it never had to be this way
You should have never played the games you played
Now I'm seeing that you're kind of lame
Knowing how the situation change

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]

Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?


[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're looking like a lonely man (Lonely man)
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurting 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy

But Caddy ain't a dummy
What these brodies want from me?
'Cause all I got is G, J.Lo
And Murda I.N.C


[Verse 5: Jennifer Lopez]
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryna make me sit and reminisce
Tryna blind me with your blinging bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever want to hear from you
I had enough of being there for you
Now I'm laughing why you play the fool

Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)

Searching to feel your soul
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

[Verse 2]
Love in and out of my, my heart
And though life can be strange, I can't be afraid
Searching to feel your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive, hmm


[Verse 1]
Time goes slowly now in my life
Fear no more of what I'm not sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Searching to feel your soul
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

[Verse 2]
Love in and out of my, my heart
And though life can be strange, I can't be afraid
Searching to feel your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez, Sample & LL Cool J]
Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love...
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Very special
Baby, don't go, uh
All my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
I understand, just chillin'
Baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
Why you actin' like that?

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving (Uh)
Can't take the way you mistreated me (Uh)
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (Don't go, baby)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
'Cause I'm good holding my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
Here we go

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have

The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 3: LL Cool J & Jennifer Lopez]
People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (Oh)
I'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (Come here)
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)
And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)
I know your game and I'm not feeling what you do (Come on, now)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (Don't bounce)
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (Don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)

You'll be needing me, but too bad (You're everything to me)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (You mean everything to me, baby)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own (We all make mistakes, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah (I still love you, baby)
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh (I'll always love you, baby)

[Outro: LL Cool J]
I promise you
You know what I'm sayin'?

Every time you look my way
I realize more and more
How much I adore those pretty eyes of yours
I'm helpless, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
What I want to know is
Are you willing to try?
Can you love me for a lifetime
In just one night? Oh

[Verse 2]
Blessed and cursed on the same day
The day that I first felt the power of you
Inside of me, such a strong feeling
There comes a time in everyone's life
When you know that everyone around you knows
That everything has changed, you're not the same
It's a new day

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what I want to know is
Are you willing to try?
There's gotta be more meaning to this
Than what meets the eye

Can't be without you (J.Lo)

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females, rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics, who give a damn what they say?

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Boy, I never knew I could feel the way I felt when I met you
I could never forget you
And boy, when you look my way (Oh, damn)
I realize more and more I adore your pretty eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
But what I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss?
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss (I need you)
Can you love me for a lifetime for just in one night?
I'm helpless for you, baby, but it's alright (Just one night)


[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Baby, I love you (Love you)
Baby, I need you (Need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you, babe)

Baby, I need you (Need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you, babe)
Can't be without you

[Interlude: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Papi, I got something to say to you (Woo)

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Blessed and cursed on the day that I felt the power of you  (Woo, woo)
Inside me, it was strong and I loved it (I did, mama, did)
And there comes a time in our lives when things change (It's a brand new day)
And baby, I'll spend it with you

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
What I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss?
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss (I love ya)
Can you love me for a lifetime but just in one night
I'm helpless for you, baby, but it's alright  (Woo)

Baby, I need you (I gotta have you)
I gotta have you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't be without you


[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Baby I love you (I love you too)
You know I need you (Woo, J.Lo)
Gotta have you (Pied piper, what? What?)
Can't be without you (Uh, J.Lo)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females, rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics, who give a damn what they say?
In the rear, drop-top Bentley on somebody's highway
Who let it jumpin' in some club on this valet?
Got a little smoke, got a little drinks sittin' in V.I.P
Got a little buzz with my hands up, honeys feeling me
Got that Cris' sittin' on ice like a gansta lean
Hands surrounding them like dice like security
After party in the Ritz Carlton, penthouse suite
All my thugs and me, breath smelling like Hennessey
Got a few friends flying in from San Diego
It's a surprise party for my homie J.Lo

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I need you (Baby, I love you)
I gotta have you, baby (Baby, I need you)
Baby, I love you (I gotta have you)
Ooh, oh, I swear I do (Can't be without you)
This a big love, babe (Baby, I love you)


[Outro: Jennifer Lopez]
Ooh (Baby, I need you)
Ladies (I gotta have you)
Do you know what I'm talking about? (Can't be without you)
Oh, woah, when a man gets inside your soul (Baby, I love you)
And it takes hold, and it won't let go (Baby, I need you)
(I gotta have you)
Hey, hey
(Can't be without you)
Hey, hey, hey
(Baby, I love you)
(Baby, I need you)

[Verse 1]
Looking through a coffee table book
At a small cafe on Broadway
Trying to find a way out of all trouble and dismay
Traveling on a road unpaved
Everywhere I look there's something there to remind me
Of feelings from yesterday
Listening to drama and hearsay only leaves me empty

[Pre-Chorus]
(But when I think of you)
You are my friend first
We talk about what hurts
We talk about love
Let's talk about us
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
What matters the most
I just want to see you up close
When I look into your heart
You got everything I want
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Chorus]
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
I want you to be mine

[Verse 2]
Turn the music up, riding on the highway
Thinking about the way that I feel when I'm with you
A feeling that continues to make me feel good
Even when I'm not near you, and I want it to stay
Emotions, I have so many
Love can give you plenty, but I know

[Pre-Chorus]
You are my friend first
We talk about what hurts
We talk about love
Let's talk about us
Can't you see I want you to be mine? (Can't you see?)
What matters the most
I just want to see you up close
When I look into your heart (Look into your heart)
You got everything I want
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Chorus]
You do what hasn't been done before (Done before)
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before (Before)
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Bridge]
Everything he does, all of the above
Didn't know until I fell in love (Until I fell in love)
Fits me like a glove, do you know?
Can't you see I want you to be mine? (I want you to be mine)
Everything he does, fits me like a glove
Didn't know until I fell in love (Until I fell in love)
All of the above, do you know?
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Chorus]
You do what hasn't been done before (Hasn't been done before)
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before (No)
No one loves you more than me (More than me)
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Outro]
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine, be mine
Oh, oh, oh, be mine

[Verse 1]
It's a new day, new day, and it's evident
You must have been Heaven sent
Sometimes we should be hesitant, but I'm not at all
Just feeling more confident
Just using my common sense
Just trusting it, I'm loving it
I can't refuse an offer so benevolent
Can't assume he's gon' use me
And after he'll never call again
Don't be afraid (No, no), don't be afraid (No)
This is your day (Yeah), this is your day

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way (Show me the way)
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave
I am brave, I am brave
Yeah, ooh
Oh, oh, ooh


[Verse 2]
I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him
It's a feeling that I'm straddling
Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
'Cause the same way, I'm scared of him
He's scared of being hurt again
It's time to let go, let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know, we might never part
Baby, don't be afraid (No), don't be afraid (No)
This is your day (Day), this is your day

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way (Show me the way)
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave


[Bridge]
I wouldn't take back anything that I've gone through (No)
I pray for strength for anything that I'm gonna do
Whether joy, or it's pain, I'm still okay (I'm still okay)
I'ma be alright, 'cause I'm not afraid
No, I am brave

[Chorus]
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore (Not anymore)
I used to be cold (Used to be cold), now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid), I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way (Show me the way)
That I might be saved

Because I am brave

[Chorus]
Nobody's breaking me down

[Verse 2]
My body's against the wall
No attention anymore

Unrelesased



Oh yeah
Yeah yeah
Ohhh
Uh uh
Uh yeah
Uh huh
Oh yeah

My girls came by
They sat me down
And they started telling me how
When you are gone
Your not at work
Said your with other women
Your such a jerk
I didn't want
To hear anymore
So I asked them to leave
And slammed the door
I didn't want to realize
My man was living a double life

I get the feeling that you don't give a shit
Your caught out there
And your not discreet with it
And everybody knows who I am
And you don't give a damn, ho!

I can't
Believe
This
Your out
There cheat-tin
Putting my name in the dirt
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight

I can't
Believe
This
Your out
There cheat-tin
Putting my name in the dirt
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight

See I was hurt
But even more
I was ashamed to say your a whore
Cause I let you in
And I just knew
That there wasn't anyone else but you
And I used to brag
About how good
My man was but oh I never should
Cause everyone was just laughing at me
Cause they all knew what it was I couldn't see

I get the feeling that you don't give a shit
Your caught out there
And your not discreet with it
And everybody knows who I am
And you don't give a damn, ho!

I can't
Believe
This [oh yeah-e-yeah]
Your out
There cheat-tin
Putting my name in the dirt
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight (tonight)

I can't
Believe
This (oh no!)
Your out
There cheatin (yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah)
Putting my name in the dirt (yeah-e-yeah)
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight

How could you look me in my eyes
And lie straight through your teeth?
I wonder how long it's been that
You've been fooling around on me
I wish that you would've had
The guts to just tell me
Cause I had to hear it from the whole damn world
That you were cheating on me
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Ooh
Oooh

I can't
Believe
This
Your out
There cheatin (cheating on me)
Putting my name in the dirt (dirt on me)
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight (tonight)

I can't
Be-lieve

Putting my name in the dirt (oh yeah)
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight

Baby baby baby baby

Yeah
Cheating on me
Yeah

Baby baby baby baby
Baby baby baby baby




[Verse 1]
How can you just say that you love me, yet to leave you alone?
You said these walls were here to protect us, but it's still not a home
All these questions that are burning inside with answers I'll never know
'Cause you're the only one who knows how you feel, but you're not letting me know

[Pre-Chorus]
What is it, love? Can I help you?
I see where this has gone and what it's coming to
I've looked to you enough

[Chorus]
I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
You know you owe it to me
How can you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving

[Verse 2]
Sitting here inside an empty room that was filled with us
Only boxes to define what was left of what we used to call love
It's sad that after all of this time, you have nothing to say
And the only thing that you could have done, you choose to walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thankful, love, I don't hate you
'Cause I'd rather live and know than what you put me through
I needed you somehow

[Chorus]
I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
You know you owe it to me
How can you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving
I can't believe this is me
I was a fool to believe you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
How could you do this to me?
How can you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving

[Verse 1]
Break it, you buy it, nothing's for free
Especially my body, especially me
Break it, you bought it, I pray that you don't
Don't do what all guys do, do what all guys do

[Pre-Chorus]
First we're getting to be social then you're turning dishonest
Think that running the street's worth it
That just turns months into weeks into days
I ain't willing to be cordial, I'm just speaking to your conscience (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
You wanna take it but I won't give it away (Oh)
Leave me in a mess I never made (Oh)
Tryna play a game I never learned (Oh)
No one ever wins a love charade
You think that you're the only one to ever say
You love me when it's over

[Verse 2]
Break it, you buy it, this one's on me
Don't start a riot, don't cause a scene
Start up a fire, pray that you don't (Ooh, ooh)
Don't do what all guys do, do what all guys do

[Pre-Chorus]
First we're getting to be social then you're turning dishonest
Think that running the street's worth it
That just turns months into weeks into days
I ain't willing to be cordial, I'm just speaking to your conscience (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
You wanna take it but I won't give it away (Oh)
Leave me in a mess I never made (Oh)
Tryna play a game I never learned (Oh)
No one ever wins a love charade
You think that you're the only one to ever say
You love me when it's over

[Bridge]
You should've took your time
Did it right when you had me, baby
You should've took your time, should've took your time (When you had me, baby)
You should've took your time
Did it right when you had me, baby
But you was playing games, all those love charades

[Chorus]
You wanna take it but I won't give it away (Oh)
Leave me in a mess I never made (No)
Tryna play a game I never learned (Oh)
No one ever wins a love charade
You think that you're the only one to ever say
You love me when it's over




[Verse 1]
Running out of juice
It's a matter of seconds now, I'm shutting down (Oh, woah-oh)
Desperate when I move
My battery is screaming loud, I'm shutting down (Oh, woah-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's an addiction, I, I, I want more, more, more
Give me some boom, boom, boom
Give me some oh, oh, oh
Kickstart my engine with a hundred thousand volts
Ignite the room, room, room

[Chorus]
Stroke me down like lightning volts
Take control of my body, every single bone
I come alive when you charge me up, baby
Charge me up, baby, charge me up, once and again
I'm dancing in your danger zone
So wired up, but I just want another dose
I come alive when you charge me up, baby
Charge me up, baby, charge me up, once and again

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again

[Verse 2]
This is my disease, my predatory instinct call
I'm about to fall (Oh, woah-oh)
Shock me fill me up
Proceed Ill give you all you want, I'm 'bout to fall (Oh, woah-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's an addiction, I, I, I want more, more, more
Give me some boom, boom, boom
Give me some oh, oh, oh
Kickstart my engine with a hundred thousand volts

[Chorus]
Stroke me down like lightning volts

[Intro]
What? What? What? Hey
Yeah, you

[Verse 1]
You had a dark, sexy vibe about you
And in a strange way you turn me on
The way you look said a lot about you
As if you really didn't give a uh
I told myself not to fall for you
Because I can see that you don't follow rules
I should have just walked away
But your eyes were telling me to stay

[Refrain]
Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on?

[Chorus]
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like

[Verse 2]
A real rebel kind of fellow
The kind that I would never trust
I could read what your mind was thinking
It's like you still didn't give a hey
It's funny how those kind of guys
Have a way of getting what they want
And even good girls, though they try
You see, they just can't seem to stay away

[Refrain]
Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on?

[Chorus]
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
Oh, that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
Oh, baby, that's what it feels like

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I can be your cherry pie
And you can be my cream on top, come on
I can be your cherry pie
And you can be my cream on top, yeah

[Chorus]
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
Oh, that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
Oh, baby, that's what it feels like
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it (Cherry pie)
Driving fast, you had to try it
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
Yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Maybe, I need to see you
Oh, oh, oh
Please, come over

[Verse 1]
One, you come to my room for a little game
To you, I'll do very erotic things
I want to make love, babe, very slowly
Three times in a row, all night I'll go

[Chorus]
I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over

[Verse 2]
Body next to mine, love dance, syncopated time
Sugar rush keeps me high, sweet kiss on my thigh
I wanna make love, baby, very badly
Feels good in the air every time you're here

[Chorus]
I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over

[Verse 3]
Don't keep me waiting, anticipating
Love, I am saving for you (Ooh)
Hear what I'm saying, you I am craving
Love is here waiting for you (Ooh)
All day you're staying, please no delaying (Oh)
Patiently waiting for you
Don't keep me waiting, no time for playing
Sitting here waiting for you

[Chorus]
Come over
I love when you come over (Please come over)
Please come over (I need to see you)
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over (I need to see you)
I love when you come over (Make it so)
Please come over (I love when you come over, come on, baby, don't make me wait)
And when you come (I need you), it gives me fever
Come over (I can't wait anymore, oh)

[Outro]
I love when you come over (I love it)
And when you come, it gives me fever (It gives me fever, oh)
I love when you come over
And when you come, it gives me fever

[Jermaine Dupri]
Ya'll know what this is...So...So...Def!

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled
She said

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 2: LL Cool J with Jennifer Lopez]
Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic
Her gaze was so hypnotic
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the after party is at my body
Meet me you're invited
She said

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth
Side, to side, and up, and down
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you

[Jermaine Dupri]
She said

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Jermaine Dupri]
Haha, you know what this is

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Love makes no promises

[Verse 1]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?

[Pre-Chorus]
How, tell me how will I know?
Will my heart make me believe it so?
Or can I trust the way I feel?
If you could read my mind (If you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew)
You see how hard I have tried (If you only knew, if you only knew)
Still, I can't decide

[Chorus]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?
Tell me could this be love?
El amor no hace promesas

[Verse 2]
Do you know if it's true?
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky?
And do you know (Do you know) if you can fall for just a moment?
Is a moment for all time?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why, why am I so unsure?
Is that love knocking at my door?
Or the sound of my beating heart?
If you could read my mind (If you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew)
You know I just can't hide (If you only knew, if you only knew)
What I feel inside

[Chorus]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?
Oh, tell me could this be love?
Could this be love?

[Outro]
(Baby, if you only knew what I've been going through)
Could this be love?
(Baby, if you only knew what I've been going through)
I wanna know
(Baby, if you only knew what I've been going through)
El amor no hace promesas
(Baby, if you only knew what I've been going through)
If you only knew
(Baby, if you only knew what I've been going through)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Baby, if you only knew what I've been going through)
Love makes no promises
(Baby, if you only knew what I've been going through)

So ahead of myself

Little bit of voli, and she'll open sesame

[Intro]
You're perfect

[Verse 1]
I just can't control myself
I can't be with no one else
It seems I'm addicted to the way you like to touch me
I don't think they understand
Why I love at your command
From the words you speak
So deep our bodies meet, I had to have you

[Chorus]
I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things

[Verse 2]
I think God made you for me
A mix of passionate fidelities
Baby, you're so complete
I write this song to let you know
That you will always be to me
My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend, and my king


[Chorus]
I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things
There's no way I'd leave you
It's just not a reality
Sometimes I feel like I'm
Living in a fantasy

All of a sudden, couldn't take my eyes off you
I didn't even know if you could tell

Don't know what you got me thinking

You and me gonna need a little privacy

Quit tryna play it cool, boy, make your move

You been staring over here all night for free
And I ain't takin' no cash or credit, just a guarantee

Me gustan hermosas senoritas (Ha!)
I love how you shake your distinctive features (Hey)
My name's Ludacris, and I'd like to freak it

And you know me, so I'm like, "Muy bien"
I'm the numero uno (What?), rico hombre
Baby, feel this and, grita mi nombre (Luda!)

[Intro: Pitbull]
It's Mr. Worldwide
With the J to the L (O-o-o-o-o)
Jenny, let me talk to 'em

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
If you think it's a joke, go 'head and laugh
Created my own lane, created my path
Graduated at high school, just not with my class
I'm like Einstein, I created my math
Hated algebra, but I loved to multiply
So I took my letters and made 'em numbers, right?
Will you evaluate? Jennifer, baby, let's celebrate

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
(Woo!)
This is for my singles ladies and single mothers
Raising babies, working hard
I know the feeling, I used to live it
My mother worked two to three jobs
That's what this song is dedicated
To all the women out there, motivated
Always finding ways to make ends meet
All my women out there, innovative
You name the game, and they've played it
They've heard all the stories, so save it
All my women with power, meet me at happy hour
Let's celebrate


[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
(Woo!)
I see you, baby, getting your hair done, getting your nails tight
I see you, baby, trying on different outfits
Making sure they fit right
I see you, baby, getting ready for the night
Making sure you look right
I see you, baby
I see you, baby

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & (Pitbull)]
You can't stop the beat (Can't stop the beat)

Get up on your feet, let's go (Can't stop the beat)
You can't stop the beat (Can't stop the beat)
La da da da de (Can't stop the beat)
Get up on your feet, let's go (Can't stop the beat)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Go, go, go, go, go, go go)

[Verse 1]
Let's play a game
Let's just pretend like you don't know who I am
Believe it if you say that you're not a fan
Act like I'm interested in some other man, man, man
Turn on the lights (The lights)
So that the cameras flashing won't be so bright (So bright)
Ain't like the crowd ain't getting big outside (Outside)
They're wanting details on how I live my life, my life, my life

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?


[Verse 2]
Out through the back (The back)
Too many people blocking the front door
We go our different ways, oh, we want more
Another gig I got don't end 'til four, four, four

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

[Bridge]
Can you hang onto a shooting star? (Star)
Handle distance near and far
Don't let the jealousy and envy get to you
'Cause I'll be running home right back to you


[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)

Out through the back (The back)
Too many people blocking the front door
We go our different ways, oh, we want more
Another gig I got don't end 'til four, four, four

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

[Bridge]
Love it
I love it
Cooler [?] cool, I'm flying and I love it [?]
She just wants to be seen
Can you hang onto a shooting star? (Star)
Handle distance near and far
Don't let the jealousy and envy get to you
'Cause I'll be running home right back to you


[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody

Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

Oh baby, the room stars spinning
I think the floors about to meet me
Every single time you step on me
Oh baby, it's beyond butterflies now
It's more like I'm mesmerized now
Can't stay relaxed when you look in my eyes
Ain't even got to whisper
And my knees get weak

If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever, we could do it forever
I could do this forever, I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever


[Verse 2]
Give me all your life, and I'd ask you for even more
You can't offer me a part of your body
'Cause honestly (Honestly), it's just not enough anymore
Let's get lost in the moment
You know you want it, what you waiting for?

[Pre-Chorus]
(I wanna be with you) I wanna be with you
(And feel the heat with you) And feel the heat with you
(I'm flying, I'm weightless) I'm floating in the distance
(Don't rush it, be patient) I'm gonna stop the hands of time, I will

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever, we could do it forever
I could do this forever, I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever

[Bridge]
Can you tell me what it is you're waiting for?
Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause I don't know
(Let's go) Come on, baby, just take my hand
(Let's go) Why you looking like you don't understand?
(Let's go) That's it, I'ma make this easy
(Let's go) And that ain't me, believe me, but just


[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever, we could do it forever
I could do this forever, I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever

[Outro]
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever

[Verse 1]
Love has done a number on my mind
Though I sit and wonder, I don't ask why
Some decisions I've made haven't altogether been mine
Now I don't feel a thing, I feel more pain

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I'm not bitter, I'm not cold
I'm just frozen for a moment
My vision is impaired
My heart is under repair

[Chorus]
What can I say about love?
I know what it means to have too little and too much
Crowding my thoughts
What I really want is to not think about it at all
Not think about it at all

[Verse 2]
Life is never easy when you need it to be
Desire can deceive you, it's better to daydream
Somewhere deep down inside, I knew it wasn't the right thing
But I didn't want to be wrong, that's a chance you take

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I'm not bitter, I'm not cold
I'm just frozen for a moment
My vision is impaired
My heart is under repair

[Chorus]
What can I say about love?
I know what it means to have too little and too much
Crowding my thoughts
What I really want is to not think about it at all
What can I say about love?
I know what it means to have too little and too much
Crowding my thoughts
What I really want is to not think about it at all

[Bridge]
I'm just frozen for a moment
Oh

[Chorus]
What can I say about love? (What can I say?)
I know what it means to have too little and too much (About love)
Crowding my thoughts (Oh, woah)
What I really want is to not think about it at all (Don't think about it)
What can I say about love? (Oh, woah, yeah)
I know what it means to have too little and too much (Ooh)
Crowding my thoughts (Crowding my thoughts)
What I really want is to not think about it at all

Okay, okay
Wait
Roll again (Roll again)
Wait

[Chorus]
Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press the whine
And what can I say? I'm feeling you

[Verse 1]
He's a legend in the making
This voice is the blame to fame
His rhythm is similar to basketball
The way he shakes and he fakes and he takes some more
With everything he does, makes me feel his love
When the DJ plays this song and we all sing along
Up in the club with our hands in the air and it's all because
He's a poet, if the world doesn't say it, I hope that he knows it
This is for Chris, big up to Nas, this is for Biggie, of course
Shout out to Brooklyn, and here's to the Bronx where it all begin


[Chorus]
Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press rewind
And what can I say? I'm feeling you

[Verse 2]
When I was growing up in the Boogietown
Hoping that music would be my faith
Looking for a way to escape
Recording the radio, took a set tape
They all sold to the UMC's
Snoop Dogg, Andre and now it's 50
All day, every day
'Cause MC's, they make me feel a special way (A special way)
Down south and your families
Back up to Bone Thugs N' Harmony
And I can't forget the ladies
Oh no, the ladies, knowing you crazy
'Lil Kim, Queen Latifah, you the queen
Salt N Pepa, Mary J. and Eve
You'll need to understand
Sugarhill made me wanna be who I am

[Chorus]
Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind (My mind)
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time (Long time)
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press rewind
And what can I say? I'm feeling you

Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me

Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
Tripping (Tripping) a little more than I should be

Got a man, but she creepin'
Don't get caught up in the deep end (Ha)

[Verse 1]
Where would I be without you, honey?
Baby I'm me, all because I love you
Oh you know the cars and the clothes and the cribs and the bankrolls
Are nothing without your loving
Although you might hear that in every love song
It's just what I feel so I'm gonna keep on, keep on, singing your praises in everyway I can think of
And this is what I mean love

[Chorus]
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf
When I see you baby, I just gotta tip my ha-a-at
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, you're the greatest part of me
And darling, you are fi-i-ine
When I see you baby, I just can't believe you're mi-i-ine
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, the greatest part of me

[Verse 2]
I said you're the shhh and here's my proclamation
My way of saying thank you for your dedication
Now I can spend the rest of my life sitting high up on cloud nine
And all because I know I'm your lady
And no, don't nothing get better than this, we steady stacking chips together
Coping gifts and taking trips and spend it on each other
No other can do-do what you do, 'cause baby you're the truth and that's why I gotta tell you that...

[Chorus]
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf
When I see you baby, I just gotta tip my ha-a-at
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, you're the greatest part of me
And darling, you are fi-i-ine
When I see you baby, I just can't believe you're mi-i-ine
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, the greatest part of me

See, when I'm looking at you, baby, all I see is...
The greatest part of me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (the greatest part of me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (the greatest part of me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh..oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh..oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Skin and bones
And flesh and blood
With all this nerve
How did we get this numb

Tell me is it wrong
To want a little change

If a million hands can build a wall

"Heart and soul
Psike!!"

It's like a song you know
In your heart and soul
You wanna sing along
Oh, oh
In your heart and soul
You wanna sing along

I am nobody talking 'bout nothing
I am nothing in comparison, to what I feel
When I open my eyes, to what is real in the life
I know it take sacrifice, you can compromise
But now I realize

[Chorus]
Heart and soul are looking for something
Keep on wanting, but am I wanting too much?
It is too much for you to be
Here for me
All or nothing that is the question
Love will always seem to find
Something true to make it right

[Verse 2]
We have everything, maybe it's nothing
But we know that there something
And I try to hold on
But it keeps escaping me
I know that I love you, but lately
Baby, something's missing
You're making me
Obsessive to the point that I'm rapidly changing
Can't take it we, try to be together when blatantly
This is not working mistakenly
We look so perfect, but everything
Ain't what it seems especially when

[Chorus]
Heart and soul are looking for something
Keep on wanting
But am I wanting too much?
It is too much for you to be
Here for me
All or nothing; that is the question
Love will always seem to find
Something true to make it right

[Post-Chorus]
It's like a song, you know
In your heart and soul
You wanna sing along

[bridge]
I mean how could we
Just giving up on a tragedy
But no one wants to live unhappily
Baby you know it's sad for me
I was glad to be your
Shoulder to cry on
Shoulder to lean on
Someone to rely on
Something to believe in
I see the tears again
Now it's coming to an end
Breaking me up
What am I to do when?

[Chorus]
Heart and soul are looking for something
Keep on wanting, am I wanting too much?
It is too much for you to be
Here for me?
All or nothing; that is the question
Love will always seem to find
Something true to make it right

[Post-Chorus]
I'm in agony, agony
Ohh oh oh, yeah
I'm in agony, agony

[Outro]
Oh, for you to be
Oh, all or nothing
Seems to find
To make it right
Something
Oh
For you to be
Oh


[Verse 1]
I know better than anybody how it feels
To want somebody so bad after you break up
Still looking for that phone call
Still, even when they don't call
Still ain't ready to walk away and call it all over
Act like you wasn't listening when they told you
They don't want to be with you anymore
Stuck in your ways, you choose to ignore

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause in your mind, you're still together
Thought it would last, but there's no forever
Walked out on you with no call, no letter
When he realize it don't get no better

[Chorus]
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
He knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back


[Verse 2]
You don't want to believe it but you see it happening
Wakes you up out of your sleep, out of the dreams you're having
Still looking for his return
Still hoping that he's gonna learn
Wake up, and realize the truth
Make some time for you
What is he trying to do to you?
Miss him more as days go by
Try your hardest not to cry and keep hope alive

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause in your mind, you're still together
Thought it would last, but there's no forever
Walked out on you with no call, no letter
When he realize it don't get no better

[Chorus]
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
He knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back


[Bridge]
Thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting
Thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting
He'll be back, thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting
Thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting

[Chorus]
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
He knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And call me baby? (No, no)

[Verse 1]
We're stacking down trust issues
I got 'em from you
Can never tell if you lie to me
'Cause they're feeling like truths
And I know I'm the jealous type, yeah
But you're tip-toeing every night, yeah
For a night, let's be eye-to-eye
Bottle wine, losing track of time, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
No one needs the complication
One touch, tell me where we stand
You and me, the right equation
Won't you tell me now?
So lost in interpretation
One touch, tell me where we stand
Are we past infatuation
Won't you tell me now?

[Chorus]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me? (Comfort me)
Oh, yeah
And if somehow you knew that
Your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby? (No, no)

If you had my love (Lo- Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo- Love)
Had my love (Lo- Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo- Love)
Had my love
If you had my lo-lo-lo-lo- love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you know you got me powerless
Every time I lose
Do you want what's best for us?
Or what's best for you?

[Pre-Chorus]
No one needs the complication
One touch, tell me where we stand
You and me, the right equation
Won't you tell me now?
So lost in interpretation
One touch, tell me where we stand
Are we past infatuation
Won't you tell me now?

[Chorus]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me? (Comfort me)
Na-na, na-na-na
And if somehow you knew that
Your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby? (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
If you had my love (Lo- Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo- Love)
Had my love (Lo- Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo- Love)
Had my love
If you had my lo-lo-lo-lo- love
If you had my love (Lo- Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo- Love)
Had my love (Lo- Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo- Love)
Had my love
What would you do if you had my love?

[Chorus]
If you had my love (Love)
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
If you had my lo-lo-lo-lo- love
And if somehow you knew that
Your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?

[Outro]
Call me baby




[Intro]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And call me baby? (No, no)

[Verse 1]
We're stacking down trust issues
I got 'em from you
Can never tell if you lie to me
'Cause they're feeling like truths
And I know I'm the jealous type, yeah
But you're tip-toeing every night, yeah
For a night, let's be eye-to-eye
Bottle wine, losing track of time, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
No one needs the complication
One touch, tell me where we stand
You and me, the right equation
Won't you tell me now?
So lost in interpretation
One touch, tell me where we stand
Are we past infatuation
Won't you tell me now?

[Chorus]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me? (Comfort me)
Oh, yeah
And if somehow you knew that
Your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby? (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
If you had my love (Lo- Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo- Love)
If you had my love (If you had my lo- lo-lo-lo-lo- love)

If you had my love (If you had my lo- lo-lo-lo-lo- love)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you know you got me powerless
Every time I lose
Do you want what's best for us?
Or what's best for you?

[Pre-Chorus]
No one needs the complication
One touch, tell me where we stand
You and me, the right equation
Won't you tell me now?
So lost in interpretation
One touch, tell me where we stand
Are we past infatuation
Won't you tell me now?

[Chorus]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me? (Comfort me)
Na-na, na-na-na

Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
(You said that we could possibly spend eternity, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams
(You want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you really want me, bae

[Chorus]
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue, yeah (How you knew)
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Na, na, na, na, na)

[Intro: Darkchild]
Aha
Right here, it's another Darkchild collab, you know?
Something that you can lean to
Something that you can ride to
Something that you can step to, you know?
We back
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes real love can be
Not seen 'cause you're thinking
What's right in front of you can't be the one for you
Then one day you realize that
There are feelings that you can't hold back
And you're so caught up, now that's all you think of
Crazy how

[Pre-Chorus]
All that talk of us not able to last (Oh)
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand

[Chorus]
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing
'Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see I've got you
You got me, I got you


[Verse 2]
Things are often said to doubt what I feel for you
But words that people say won't take my love away
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright
But why they say some things that ain't right?
I never know but please understand that, baby, it ain't nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
All that talk of us not able to last
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand

[Chorus]
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing (Ooh, no)
'Cause you gotta know you got me (You got me, yeah)
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me (Proud)
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)
I got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)

[Bridge]
Talk is all that people can do
Nevermind all the love
All that you gotta do is simply love
Trust, and just stay or there's no "us"
Together we will get through whatever if we
Don't let speculations make situations up
We'll be alright


[Chorus]
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing (Nobody, nobody)
'Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me (Oh-woah)
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)
I got you, oh, and nobody can come and change a thing (Feels so good inside)
'Cause you gotta know you got me (You got me, yeah)
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me (Oh, baby, they'll see)
They will see I've got you (I've got you)

[Outro]
You got me (Yes, you got me, baby)
I got you (Nothing come between us)
You got me (You got me)
I got you (Through whatever)
You got me (You're all that I need)
I got you (Oh, baby)
You got me (Forever, baby)
I got you (I got you)
You got me (You got me)
I got you, you got me
I got you, and you got me


[Intro]
I love
Boy, I love you so
I love

[Verse 1]
You and I have been around each other for quite a while
But I don't think that you understand the way that I feel for you
Baby, it took a while for me, yeah, yeah, to realize that you were so naive
Well maybe you were blind and cannot see
The feelings I have for you, you don't understand
The things that I've gone through
To paint a perfect picture just for you (Picture for you)
I've even told your friends, but that won't do
Well, baby, you have to know, I can't wait no more

[Chorus]
(I) Love you more than you will ever know
(Love) I've been trying so hard to show you
(I) Love you like a queen would love her king
(Love) Baby, I've been trying to show you

[Verse 2]
Look at me, try to understand that I am here for you
And whatever you are going through no matter what you ask me to do I will do
See baby, I'm trying to make you see (Tryna make you see)
This is not pretend or make believe (Make believe)
I want to be the woman that you need
Just let me get close to you, take me in your heart
Every day I want you more and more (Want you more and more)
Never in my life was I so sure (Oh-oh-oh)
These feelings I have I can't ignore
So baby, just let me know, all I'm trying to say is


[Chorus]
(I) Love you more than I can love myself
(Love) I would die before I hurt you
(I) Love you like a woman loves a man
(Love) When there's no one else to live for

[Bridge]
Baby, for so long
I've always tried to show you just how much I care for you
Boy, you had to know that I could never let you go
I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you understand that

[Chorus]
(I) Love you when there's no more love to give
(Love) Baby, I will always want you
(I) Love you when you're up against it all
(Love) I'l be by your side forever

[Outro]
(I) I love you, baby, love you, baby
(Love) Love you, baby, love you, baby
(I) Love you, baby, love you, baby
(Love) I love you, baby, love you, baby
(You)



[Verse 1]
My heart belongs to you
So what could I do
To make you feel I'm down with
You see me hangin' around
But you don't know how you make me feel for you, and

[Pre-Chorus]
(Each and every day) I try to make some sense of this
(What you mean to me) I know it could be serious
(Each and every night) I dream about just holding you
(Loving you like this) what is a girl supposed to do?

[Chorus]
I love you (I love you)
I want you (I want you)
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore (anymore)
I love you (I love you)
I need you (and I need you)
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me

[Verse 2]
First time I saw your face
My heart just erased
All the guys I knew
Before you walked into my life
I was the type to never want for nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
(Each and every day) I try to make some sense of this
(What you mean to me) I know it could be serious
(Each and every night) I dream about just holding you
(Loving you like this) What is a girl supposed to do?

[Chorus]
I love you (I love you)
I want you (I need you)
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore
I love you (I love you)

What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me

[Bridge]
I love you, I want you, I need you in my life
Can't you see what you mean to me?
Baby, come hold me tight
I miss you, wanna kiss you
Every time I see your face
Baby, I'll be waiting for you
Each and every day

[Chorus]
I love you (oh...)
I want you
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore
(Baby, you know that I love you)
I love you

You're the only one for me (oh yeah)

[Bridge]
You're the only one for me (only one)
And I know it's meant to be
(and I know we're meant to be)
What can I do to make you see
My love will carry on (listen to my heart)
So listen to my heart and know (and know)
You'll find out where my love will go (love will go)
The future lies between us both
Oh babe, I love you so

[Chorus]
I love you
I want you
(and you know my heart belongs to you, boy)
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore
I love you (baby, I love you)
I need you (baby, I need you)
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me
I love you (you're the one for me)
I want you (it was meant to be)
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore

If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head
Put it on you, I'ma need about 4-5 beds
'Cause I love my papi

Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drive it how you want, I ain't tryna count mileage

Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof

[Verse 1]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Bridge]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need (Need to do) to do to be okay (For me to be okay)
Never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you)
But now it's time for me to make that move, oh woah
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did, baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it (To my eyes)
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Oh, no)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it

Oh yes

Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from "Casino" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo' hand
All I know, when Nas was yo' man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]

Be living without you (Living without you, shit 'cause life is crazy)
So now it's time for me to make that move (Uh, check it)

[Verse 4: Nas & (Jennifer Lopz)]
Yo, nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin (Oh, no)
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright (Be alright, yes)
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right? (Oh, no)
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature?
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat (Said I'm gonna be alright)
I'm slow caught

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright




[Intro]
Oh, yes
Yes, I did, baby
Yes, I did

[Verse 1]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Bridge]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need (Need to do) to do to be okay (For me to be okay)
Never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you)
But now it's time for me to make that move, oh woah
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did, baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it (To my eyes)
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Oh, no)

[Outro]
Be alright, yes (Oh, no)
Say's I'm gonna be alright




[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & (50 Cent)]
Oh yes
(Uh-huh, yes)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I want to be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears
The reason you have the courage to confront your fears (Woo!)
The reason there's two karats in each your ears
I sperge with the paper, ma, I don't care
How you like the pumps, boots, Jeeps, coupes?
Make celebs, 50 fall off never
What's mines is yours and what's yours is mine
So when I shinin', you shine
Come on, the finest champagne, we can toast to life
Crap table in Vegas, you can toss the dice
Don't let your friends get you confused sayin' 50 bad news
I need you in my life, girl, you're too much to lose (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear

'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]

Never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you, yeah)
But now it's time for me to make that move (Uh-huh, yeah)
Oh woah

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Now when I tell you what my wishes are, you don't respect it
When I smile at you, you don't smile back to reconnect it
You ain't even gone long but I already miss you (Yeah!)
I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you
All the talking on the phone, all the time we shared
How could you fix your mouth to say I don't care?
I had plans for us to buy ice together
Engagement rings and things and share life together (Woo!)
Now when your friends tell you 50 called you like whatever
Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start?
Or was it my actions that made us fall apart?
Just want you to know you'll always have a place in my heart

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did, baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it (To my eyes)
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Interlude: Jennifer Lopez]
Oh, no
Be alright, yes
Oh, no
Says I'm gonna be alright

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Okay, now I'm into you, like you never knew
I'm falling for you, baby, I need a parachute
Pussy so wet, I need a wetsuit
You're way too fly, I could be your jet fuel
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me
It's too late, it's too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race, ha!

[Intro]
What's my name
R-U-L-E
Blowing back on mary jane
And analyzin' the game
The game done chose me
To bring the words I can't say, it's one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I'll be makin' less room for you
Only God can hold me
Judge me, the only man that help is above me, holla

[Verse 1]
I've met so many men and
It's like they're all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feelin' sexy
Who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is
Their insecurities

[Pre-Chorus]
Tired being alone (yeah, yeah)
Sick of arguin' on the phone (yeah, yeah)
Tellin' all your friends (yeah, yeah)
But your man don't understand my love

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, the style of your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 2]
Now I've been thinkin' bout this relationship, and I wanna know
Is this as good as it gets
'Cause we've been through the worst times
And the best times
But it was our time
Even if it was part time
Now they be lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we're gettin' married
Hard lovin', straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this for nothing
Hoppin', poppin'
Let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind
Sun glistenin' off my skin, hey!
And I'm nasty, and you know me
You still don't mess with your baby

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, the style of your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 3]
Now people loving me and hating me and treating me ungratefully
But not knowin' that they ain't makin' or breakin' me
My life, I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breath again, baby I can breath again
People screaming "what the deal with you and so and so"
I tell them bitches "mind your biz," but they don't hear me though
I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I can breath again, baby I can breath again

[Pre-Chorus]
Tired being alone (yeah, yeah)
Sick of arguin' on the phone (yeah, yeah)
Tellin' all your friends (yeah, yeah)
But your man don't understand my love

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, the style of your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
And I can't go on without you


[P. Diddy]
Yeah

[J. Lo]
Called you on the phone, said, "I'm comin through
Hope you're all alone, cause I got plans for you
We could stay at home, or dance and hang all night
As long as I'm with you, doesn't matter what we do"

(Bridge)
[J. Lo]
Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do, just know that I'm here with you

[Intro: Ja Rule & Jennifer Lopez]
(Murder Inc)
What's my motherfuckin' name?!
R-U-L-E
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin' the game
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggas & pussy hoes
They're one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I've been makin' less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me
The only man that hovers above me, holla

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I met so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feeling sexy, who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is their insecurity

[Pre-Chorus: Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Together]
Tired of being alone, yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone, yeah, yeah
Are you telling all your friends, yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand my love?


[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 2: Ja Rule with Jennifer Lopez]
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets?
'Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nothing
I'm here to get it poppin', hop in', let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't fuck with your baby

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you


[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Now people lovin' me and hating me, treating me ungratefully
But not knowing that they ain't making or breaking me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again
Now people screaming what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them niggas mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
'Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I could breathe again, baby, now I could breathe again

[Pre-Chorus: Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Together]
Tired of being alone, yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone, yeah, yeah

The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk

The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild

[J. Lo (Nate)]
Now only God can hold me
(You make me go "baby")

[Jennifer]
I've seen so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hungers pain
And when I'm feeling sexy who's gonna comfort me
My only problem is their insecurities

[Nate Dogg]
Tell me who is that girl, standing cross the way
She like what I got, got, got, watch her become my slave
Baby girl it's me, yeah that crazy nigga Nate

Just testing my skills
I'm looking for a sexy girl to take and peel

(Chorus- till fade)




[Intro]
Ah, haha, yeah, ye-yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're afraid but give it time
There's got to be something you like
Love letters but no replies
Boy, you've got to know what you want

[Pre-Chorus]
From the way you look at me
Friends checking me (Oh)
Always whispering
Never confront me (Oh-oh-oh)
Think that I'm gonna let you know
That's no time for playing no more

[Chorus]
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting

[Verse 2]
It's okay, don't be shy
Because you might find love in the first try
Now you know I can't read your mind
You got to let me know what you want

[Pre-Chorus]
From the way you look at me
Friends checking me (Friends checking me)
Always whispering
Never confront me (Confront me)
Think that I'm going to let you know
That's no time for playing no more

[Chorus]
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting

[Bridge]
I don't know why you would have to hide the way you feel (Hide the way you feel)
Listen to your heart and don't deny that this is real (Deny that this is real)
You know you really want to be here in my arms, holding me
So tell that you want me like I want you (What are you gonna do?)
Yeah, ha, uh, ha

[Chorus]
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?

[Intro]
Uh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
This is where my story begins
Standing here with you, I'm about to give in
And I'ma give all I can give
Even though in previous relationships
I might have been mischievous
I wasn't always ready, I admit to this
But what a good feeling it is
I've had a lot of crushes, close to nothing like this (Yeah, uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time the subject would come up (Yeah, yeah)
I made up every excuse that I could think of (Oh, yeah)
I used to run but now I'm getting warmed up
In a few words, this feeling, I could sum up

[Chorus]
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting, I need


[Verse 2]
I was hanging out with my friends
Seven nights a week, if there's a party, I'm in
But I started getting sick of it
And when I looked back, I didn't know what it meant (What it meant)
I guess I wasn't interested in finding something real
Though I was looking for it (Looking for it)
You should've been looking for me
But you opened up my eyes, and now I can see

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time the subject would come up (Oh)
When they say "I love you," then I only dumb up
A lot of guys wouldn't put up, girl, or shut up (Oh)
But you're the only one who told me your love was endless
A lot of words with feeling cannot sum up
First I had to figure out who I was (Oh)
To try and understand there ain't no shortcuts
Now the only thing that's missing is your love

[Chorus]
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting, I need


[Bridge]
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me? (Love)
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance (Love)
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance (Love)
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me? (Love)

[Chorus]
Slow dance (Love), hold hands
For the first time in my life, I need love
If it's real, let me know it's real
All I need, love
'Cause I been looking for a man
Wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
Slow dance, hold hands
For the first time in my life, I need love
If it's real, let me know it's real
Wanna feel, I wanna feel, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
Slow dance, hold hands
For the first time in my life, I need love
If it's real, let me know it's real
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love

That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love


[Outro]
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance (Love)
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance (Yeah, love)
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me? (Love)



Unreleased




[Chorus]
If you love me
Say it in the morning
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body

[Verse 1]
Sweet little white lies
Your sweet little white lies
Leave a bad taste in my mouth
Your taste in my mouth (Come on)
Queen in the night time
Black dress with white wine
Mess it up, watch it fall down
When you watch it fall down

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me I'm a real one, I'm the right one
But only when you're on one
You tell me that you need me, wanna see me
But only when you want some, want some

[Chorus]
Yeah, if you love me
Say it in the morning
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body
Baby, love me like you mean it

Only when you want my body, want my body

[Post-Chorus]
Na ma na, na ma na, eh
Na ma na, na ma na, eh

[Verse 2]
Hands cover my neck (Uh)
Hold tight 'cause you're obsessed
Come get it in when you're out
Get it in when you're out
Go down in the dim light
You love it 'cause it's so tight
So you better lock it down
You know you better lock it down

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me I'm a real one, I'm the right one
But only when you're on one
You tell me that you need me, wanna see me
But only when you want some, want some

[Chorus]
Yeah, if you love me
Say it in the morning
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body
Baby, love me like you mean it

[Bridge]
Sweet little white lies
Your sweet little white lies
Leave a bad taste in my mouth
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus]
If you love me (If you love me)
Say it in the morning (Say it in the)
Not just in the evening (Ooh)
Only when you want my body, want my body
Baby, love me like you mean it (Like you mean it)

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Verse 1]
Can't decide, can't define what I feel inside
It's still bad, it's still good, prefer and love
It's a rush, it's so rough, this is out of line
It's a storm and it rock, rock, rocks my boat

[Pre-Chorus]
My destiny, misery, your energy

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Verse 2]
Like a wild wrecking ball, crashing block-by-block
I'm defenseless, it penetrates my walls
Freezing cold, steaming hot, sweaty drip-drip-drop
It's unstoppable, I can't shake it off


[Pre-Chorus]
My destiny, misery, your energy

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Bridge]
It's taking me down and getting me high
It brings every fantasy to life
It's getting so loud, I hear it all around
And I just can't fight

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

Na na na na na
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious

[Verse 1]
How could you tell me that you love me
When I knew you were just tryna play me?
But you're the fool because I know how to switch the game up on you
And in the end, I know who will lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I played this game before (Game before)
And I can't play no more (Play no more)
What do you take me for? (Take me for)
It's not what you thought (What you thought)
So don't play games with me (Games with me)
'Cause I came to teach (I came to teach)
And if you want to cheat (Want to cheat)
It won't be with me (Be with me)

[Chorus]
It's not that serious (Oh)
I never put that much thought into us (To us)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (Curious)
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious

[Verse 2]
It should concern you that I'm always one step ahead of you
So that should let you know that what you do
I have done before, it's nothing new
So run those games on someone who can't be fooled

[Pre-Chorus]
I can almost see (Almost see)
Lies coming through your teeth (Through your teeth)
In every word you speak (Word you speak)
You make it clear to me (Clear to me)
That you're playing wrong (Playing wrong)
And your game ain't strong (Game ain't strong)
I've been in this too long (This too long)
So just be moving on (Moving on)

[Chorus]
It's not that serious (Oh, ooh)
I never put that much thought into us (I never did, I never did)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (I was so curious)
Who did you think that you were involved with? (Who did you think?)
Now, baby, you should know
It's not that serious (Oh)
I never put that much thought into us (Yeah)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with? (That you were)
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious

[Bridge]
Tu me haces reir todas las veces que
Tu creias que yo no sabia que
Tu estabas haciendo
Tu sabes que yo ha sido todo eso antes
Al final tu eres el perdia
No jueges conmigo
Don't play games with my heart
(Don't play games with my, my heart)
I will let you go before you start
(I will let you go before you start)

[Chorus]
It's not that serious (Baby)
I never put that much thought into us (To us)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (I was curious)
Who did you think that you were involved with? (Yeah)
Now, baby, you should know
It's not that serious (It's never been)
I never put that much thought into us (No, no, no)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (Yes, I was)
Who did you think that you were involved with? (That you were)
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious




[Intro]
I've been

[Verse 1]
All I need is a place to be and a way to feel
A space to figure out where I belong
A chance to know my thoughts and find a way to show
What I feel and if this is real, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for your patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately, I've been so confused

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?

[Verse 2]
Wondering endlessly if this is right or wrong
Or if it's just about me all along
All I need is time to search within my soul
So I can share a deeper part of me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for your patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately, I've been so confused

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?

[Bridge]
Baby, what's meant to be (What's meant to be)
Will surely be (Will surely be, baby)
(If you love me, baby, you would understand)
But I can't give you anything (Can't give you anything)
I don't have myself to give (Don't have myself to give)
And it's killing me inside

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Let's go)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Dawg, it's these jealous ass hoes I can't relate to
The type to follow you but hardly follow through
You say I'm on your mind, I'm wondering why I'm not on you
Girl, you're fresh out the shower
Towel around your head like you're Erykah Badu
It's lookin' like a spa day
I rearrange your chakras, listenin' to Sade
Let's take a road trip and get high on the highway (Swerve, swerve)
Migrate, spend time, lay back, watch the sky change, woah
And I hear the jealousy, but look, I never listen
The quickest way to let something die is lack of attention (Straight up)
And you got it all, you looking good as my intentions (Damn)
We on an ascension, straight up

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
But girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Let's ride)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind (Oh)
Fuck what they say (Fuck 'em)

Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Woah)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Woah)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Jealous)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
These boys scared I'ma take they chick (They chick)
Must be the money, 'cause a young boy rich (Real rich)
You could drop a dime, but I make it make sense
Girl, you coming home with me
You the last number on my call list (Call list)
Pull up on me, girl, let's get lit (Get lit)
I think I hit a lick
I think I hit a lick, yeah (Another one)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Jealous, let's go)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (No, they don't want us)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Jealous)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Oh, no, they don't)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (No-woah, no-woah, no)

Let me be the ground to your feet
If the day comes that you feel weak
Let me be the armor you need

[Chorus 1]
Oh, if falling in love is a crime
And the price to pay is my life
Give me the sword, bring all the knives
Hand me the gun, I will not run
And when they spare everything but my pride
Don't you worry, boy, don't you cry
But when they ask who was the one
Who did you love?
Let it be me

If you ever meet your last breath
Let me be the last word you say
And if right comes, but you choose left
I will be the first to forgive

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if Heaven is a beautiful place
But those gates don't have enough space
And they lock you out, spare you no flame
I will come down there on my wings
And when the angels call me a fool
For giving all my grace up for you
I won't look back, but when they ask
Who did you love?
Let it be me


[Bridge]
Let it be me that you think of
When everything tells you to give it up
Let it be me that will anchor your soul

Until the clouds fall out of the sky
And the snow falls down in July
Let it be me that you think of
Let it be me, the one that you love
Until the flowers don't bloom in May
And forever runs out of days
Let it be me, let it be me
The one that you love
Let it be me

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw the dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Or that Dolce dress with the split us the hamstring
I ain't tryna buy your heart with money
What I'm eatin' now, how I'm gon' starve my honey?
If I went broke today, I'd be back at the block
Catch a case just to keep your face between rocks
Uh, even if we have to live in a box
I'll make the sacrifice, so you go 'head and live with your pops
Come on, ma, you know better
Even though you got your own cheddar
We can spend mine together
Can't lie, all I think about is dine together
In the same house that we planned to buy together
Jenny, it's all about you
I only trick 'cause I'm allowed to
But it don't mean ish without you

Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Eh-yo ma' you always kept it real
You been had a Benz way before I got this deal
I know its not about the money, the ropes or the missed stones
The leather, platinum rings and summer b-tones
They say we fled from the cameras, boo
Plus they found a hammer and ordered to trap me off
They must question you, say Jenny, shh, look me dead in my eyes
You tellin me that I don't love you boo, that wouldn't be wise
We whine in the best cuisines, Italian restaurants
Big lobster dishes wit Trump, this how come I feel for you
Sweetheart I'll kill for you
Shockin secrets revealed and my will goes to you
So stop all the yellin, Jennifer calm down
We need classed, guidance counsellors to calm us down
A grown man and stand as a man of my word
You see here? Look at her, all these bitches is birds

[Chorus 2 - 2X]

[Break: Ghostface Killah]
Eh-yo ma', you know you the realest

You watch and see

To show me that your love is true (It is)

Is love, is love, is love, is love

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm...I'm wide awake
Ready to create
Everything I've imagined
Hearts, without any hate
Crying for change
Causing a chain reaction

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Those who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down
Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound
If they try to deny us or silence us now
We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know

Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

We...we'll be alright
Living our lives
Finding some satisfaction
No, we're not gonna hide
No fear from our eyes
Love is a call to action

[Verse 3: Lin-Manuel Miranda (Jennifer Lopez)]
Yeah, when the music is playing and the place is jumping
When the bass rattles your ribcage, hey something's changed
I'm dancing face to face with a stranger
A moment of grace, you know that you're safe, and they just
Drop the beat the moment you most needed it
You came in as a question until the music completed it
Me and you in the universe, moving in unison, coming in hot
But in the grand scheme what do we got?
What we got is love even when the sinners hate us
We can not let 'em diminish or intimidate us
We sing out, we got the rhythm and the truth on our side
We cut through the divide and we do it with pride
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
A generation of innovators unable to patiently wait for change
Cause change is what they've been afraid of
Their malevolence can wait, raise the level of debate
Celebrate, elevate, love, love
(Love make the world go round)


[Interlude: Lin-Manuel Miranda (Jennifer Lopez)]
Cannot be killed or swept aside
(Love make the world go round)
And fill the world with music, love and pride
(Love make the world go round
Love make the world go round)
And love is love, is love, is love is love
Is love, is love, is love, is love
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round

[Outro]
We're not staying inside today
They're not taking our pride away
Le-lo-lai-la-lo-lai-lo-le
We're not staying inside today
They're not taking our pride away
Le-lo-lai-la-lo-lai-lo-le
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round


[Verse 1]
Would you mind if I took the time to get to know you?
'Cause it's been a while since all we've been through
And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change
Nothing stays the same, ooh
I could see when I look in your eyes, you mean no harm
It's just the way you manipulate me with your charm
And I can tell the love I have for you still strong
And there ain't nothing wrong with me still loving you

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (Ooh)
I find myself still loving you (Yeah)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (Ooh, ooh)
We just need to take it slow

[Verse 2]
In the past, you would act as if you don't really care
You would fight and argue almost anywhere
Looking back sometimes, I feel like such a fool
For putting up with you, boo
Baby, please understand me if it seems I'm confused
It's just it might take me some time to get used to you
When I think of all the things we used to do, baby
I just find myself still loving you


[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (Yeah)
I find myself still loving you (Oh)
But I think we need to take the time to get back (No, no)
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (Baby)
We just need to take it slow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I believe you and me have a chance to make this right
Oh, baby, if your heart is in it, I'm still with it
Even after all this time has passed
Oh, I'm still loving you

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (Yeah)
I find myself still loving you (Oh, woah, yeah)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (Baby)
We just need to take it slow
After all that we've been through (Oh-oh)
I find myself still loving you (Baby)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing (Never give up)
I never give up on the love we had (Love we had)
We just need to take it slow

[Verse 1]
Strangers always got some mess to spread
But I have learned to flick them off (Them off)
Can't walk a mile in my YSLs
I strap 'em on and I walk it off (It off)

[Pre-Chorus]
Got 'em saying, "I can't believe she did it
No, she didn't"
My "wow" factor's got 'em crazy (Crazy)
Got 'em saying, "Yeah, she did it
But I can't believe it"
Never say you can't believe (Haha, haha, haha)

[Chorus]
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes

[Verse 2]
My strut's so fierce
Steven's got 'em mad at me
Laugh and talk behind my back
But they'll never get the best of me
I see 'em doing my dance
And I hear 'em singing my song
I'm surpassing the rest
'Cause that's how I was raised to do it

[Pre-Chorus]
Got 'em saying, "I can't believe she did it
No, she didn't"
My "wow" factor's got 'em crazy (Crazy)

Never say you can't believe (Haha, haha, haha)

They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes

[Bridge]
I'm walking tall
I don't let their hatred test me
They bite the dust, head above water
They still can't breathe
My feet pound the ground as I stomp it out
I dare you to walk a mile in my shoes (Haha, haha, haha)

[Chorus]
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill

But in the back of my mind

I can't catch a single breath, baby
Help me now, help me now
Hurry up, it's killing me

Hurry up, it's killing me
The way I need you mouth to mouth

Kills me to let him inside

[Verse 1: Jennifer Nettles and Jennifer Lopez]
Well the sun goes up and the sun goes down
And it looks the same on both sides of town
(Really not that different)
Yeah I give them a kiss and I tuck them in
And get ready for tomorrow and I do it all over again
(Really not that different)
And I'm worried that I'm feeling when I'm staring at the ceiling, yeah man
Be the same way you're feeling when you lay down tonight

[Chorus: Together]
My house is your house
Same dirty laundry, same dirty dishes
My house is your house
Air it all out and sort all the issues
I love to sing, I love to dance
We're making memories, we're making plans
With the same prayers, same hurt
Same love, same worth
The places we come from may feel so distant
But we're really not that different
(Sing it like your momma taught you)
(Mi casa es tu casa)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Nettlesand Jennifer Lopez]
We hang on the bush, we hang on the stoop
My boys shooting deer, our boys shooting hoops
(Really not that different)
It's in the way we live, it's in the way we talk
I'm Jenny from the dirt road, I'm Jenny from the block
(Really not that different)
And I struggle through the day thinking there's no way
I'm gonna make it through this
And I say to myself "Baby no te preocupes"
No don't you worry

[Chorus: Together]
My house is your house
Same dirty laundry, same dirty dishes
My house is your house
Air it all out and sort all the issues
I love to sing, I love to dance
We're making memories, we're making plans
With the same prayers, same hurt
Same love, same worth
Life is what it is and what it isn't
But we're really not that different

[Bridge: Together]
They say your fences make good neighbors
Instead of building walls let's tear them to the ground
Let 'em try to separate us
Together they will never take us down
My house is your house
My house is your house
My house is your house
Mi casa es tu casa

[Outro: Together]
My house is your house
Same dirty laundry, same dirty dishes
My house is your house
Air it all out and sort all the issues
My house is your house
Oh, really not that different
My house is your house
My house is your house




[Verse 1]
Forgiving him was the first thing I had to to
In order to move on
Forgetting it was not as easy to do
I had to teach myself to be strong
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how he made me feel
The bad and the good, sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back, gotta keep moving

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so good, don't wanna hear no woulda coulda
Maybe I shoulda stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing, now that I'm knowing

[Chorus]
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I have to admit
You weren't the only one at fault
I was wrong too
Trying to be someone I knew that I wasn't
I thought I could make myself happy with you
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how he made me feel
The bad and the good
Sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back, gotta keep moving

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so good, don't wanna hear no woulda coulda
Maybe I shoulda stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing, now that I'm knowing

[Chorus]
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
I knew I was gonna get through it
Breaking up is hard to do, but I had to do it
Time has something to do with me figuring it out
What this is all about
When it came to me, when it comes to me
Gotta do what's best for me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so good, don't wanna hear no woulda coulda
Maybe I shoulda stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good now that I'm going forward (Oh)
Now that I'm growing, now that I'm knowing

[Chorus]
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, never gonna give up on love, oh-oh
(Never gonna give up, give up)
(Never gonna give up, give up on love, oh)

[Outro]
Never gonna give up on love
Never gonna give up on love
On love (Hahaha)




[Verse 1]
I've been tossing and turning
Oh, this hunger is burning
I need something to feed my soul (Oh, oh, oh)
I race my thoughts to the morning
I got this need that's growing
Wake you up just to make me whole (Oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Your body is Heaven and it feels like home (Oh, oh, oh)
And those sweet lips, I can never let you go

[Chorus]
I'm never satisfied
Honey, my appetite is keeping me up at night
I'm going crazy for more of your love
I need you all the time
You bring me back to life
I'm going crazy for more of your love

[Verse 2]
Craving hits every time I leave you
There ain't nothing else I can do
I'll follow anywhere you go (Oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Your body is Heaven and it feels like home (Oh, oh, oh)
And those sweet lips, I can never let you go

[Chorus]
I'm never satisfied
Honey, my appetite is keeping me up at night
I'm going crazy for more of your love
I need you all the time
You bring me back to life
I'm going crazy for more of your love

[Bridge]
One taste is never enough, I'm losing my mind
I can't stop thinking 'bout your sweet love all of the time
I don't know if I'm gonna make it alone
Make it alone

[Chorus]
I'm never satisfied
Honey, my appetite is keeping me up at night
I'm going crazy for more of your love
I need you all the time (All the time)
You bring me back to life (Back to life)
I'm going crazy for more of your love

Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Took a shot with the bad boy from the block
And picked my love right from the start
Mister wrong, he plays his part
Back to the beginning, now round two
Try my luck with something new
We danced until we said "I do"
My luck is bad, no more us two
No me and you (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too much to ask for a real love?
Something that'll last

[Chorus]
Is there one love only once in a lifetime?
It's so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
Is there one love, somebody that compliments me
And makes me want to never leave?
Made just right for me
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
It's take three, could there be a part for me?
Came and swept me off my feet
Went nowhere, but kept the ring
Once again, I'm lonely
Number four, he sang to me but I'm not sure
So worn out, but love just saw
Made me want to try once more
And I couldn't say no (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too much to ask for a real love?
Something that'll last?

[Chorus]
Is there one love only once in a lifetime?
It's so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
Is there one love, somebody that compliments me
And makes me want to never leave?
Made just right for me
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)

[Bridge]
What's wrong with the girl wanting everything?
Good love, real trust, true meaning, oh
Who truly completes me?
I'm good on my own, but I have to know

[Chorus]
Is there one love only once in a lifetime?
It's so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
Is there one love (Oh), somebody that compliments me (Oh)
And makes me want to never leave? (Oh)
Made just right for me
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
Is there one love?

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 2: Big D The Impossible]
Sometimes i go out at night just to clear my mind from hyperdrive
All the people on the street moving quickly on the feets going somewhere
But they don't know where they wanna be
So what's it gonna be know

[Verse 1]
You must be thinking how did I get here
And I wonder if you've been here before
So many things I want to ask you, and know about you
You seem like you are ready to run
Stand right up and walk out that door
Oh yes you've been here before
But for this moment you're all mine
So let's just take it one step at a time

[Chorus]
One step at a time
No need to rush
Let's keep this time for us
And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast

[Verse 2]
I would spend my lifetime wondering why
He chose me for you and you for I
You have things to teach me
I have a feeling inside
I have this vision of three of us
Holding hands
Through a valley and jumping towards the sky


[Chorus]

[Bridge]
How can three become one
You're the greatest thing that I've ever done
I want to create a world
You will always want comeback to
And here's my wish for both of you

[Verse 1]
Someone found a letter you wrote me, on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I was so surprised and shocked
And I Wondered too
If by change you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling about you
But they said it really loud
They said it on the air

[Hook]
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio whoa oh oh now, now
Now, now
Now, now
Now, now

[Verse 2]
Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song?
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon
Whoa, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yeah, and it made me feel proud when I heard you say
You couldn't find the words to say yourself
And now in my heart, I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air

[Hook]
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio, yeah
On the radio
On the radio
Yeah

[Verse 3]
If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you might find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
'Cause he said it really loud, he said it on the air

[Hook]
On the radio, whoa oh-oh

If you take this trip with me
You'll be open off my love (You'll be open)
If only for one night
I know I can make you mine (Come on)
Touch you in that place you like
You'll be open off my love

Take a moment to stop and think about
The last time you felt like this
Come on, baby, nobody's gonna see
'Cause I know you're feeling me

Ain't no use in tryna hide

I'm gonna take you where you want to go
On a trip to ecstasy

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children, than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
One person
One very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half, now you're whole

[Chorus]
No more hunger and thirst
But first, be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Baby relax, we've been waiting for this
And we deserve the heavenly bliss
That waits underneath the stars above
Can't you hear them begging us, "Let's make love"?
From the bottom of my heart I give you my soul
Right here in this room the truth unfold

[Refrain]
Is saying (Saying), stop playing (Playing)
Delaying the divine

[Chorus]
The pleasure is mine (Oh-oh), let me give some to you
We can take our time (Take our time), nothing I'd rather do (Oh, no)
To make you feel fine, to make your life shine
Give you moments you can treasure forever (Forever)
Remember (Remeber) the pleasure is mine
Mine, mine, all mine

[Verse 2]
Everyday I've been dreaming about how
It's gonna be to find you out
To be sharing your kiss, to be just like this
What I wouldn't do for a taste of your lips
So let's not waste one second more
Let's cut the lights and let's lock the door


[Refrain]
Is saying (Saying), stop playing (Playing)
Delaying the divine

[Chorus]
The pleasure is mine (Yeah), let me give some to you (To you)
We can take our time (Take our time, yeah), nothing I'd rather do (Oh, no)
To make you feel fine, to make your life shine
Give you moments you can treasure forever (Forever)
Remember (Remeber) the pleasure is mine
Mine, mine, all mine
The pleasure is mine, mine, mine, all mine
The pleasure is mine

[Verse 3]
Oh baby, I don't wanna breathe (I don't wanna)
Don't wanna change a single vibe (Don't wanna)
Nobody else I'd rather see (Nobody else)
When you're like this before my eyes
Wanna be everything you need
Keep you satisfied
I'm praying (I'm praying), stop playing (Stop playing)
Is saying (Saying), stop playing (Playing)
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
The pleasure is mine (All mine, yeah), let me give some to you
We can take our time (Take our time, yeah), nothing I'd rather do (Rather do)
To make you feel fine (Fine), to make your life shine (Shine)
Give you moments you can treasure forever (Forever, forever)
Remember (Remeber, remember) the pleasure is mine


[Outro]
The pleasure is mine, mine, mine, all mine

Let me give some to you (Feel fine, make your life shine)
We can take our time, mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine
Nothing I'd rather do

Let me give some to you (The pleasure is mine)
We can take our time, mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine
Nothing I'd rather do

[Verse 1]
I know it's on your heart
That a love like ours shall never fall apart
You're so afraid of the rain
So I will take your hand
And I'll love you in the best way that I can
And I only expect the same

[Chorus]
Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Though I am sure of what I feel
I never thought a love so true felt so unreal
And I'm a little afraid myself
But if you love me day by day
With an honest heart and just a little faith
Baby, time will tell the tale

[Chorus]
Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try


[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Mmm

[Chorus]
Don't promise me forever
Don't you promise me the sun and the sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try, ooh
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Like deja vu, seen it before
Ain't nothing new up under the sun
Don't take my kindness for gullible
Ain't nothing new, you can try to run
Give you your rope, don't hang yourself
Prove all my theories 'bout you wrong
Show up early, not an hour late
If you want my lovin', that last you long

You got my front, you got my back
Without anybody else on the side
Could you pick me up when I'm feeling low?
Balance me out when I get too high
Read my the realest, no matter what
Don't just tell me what I wanna hear
Show me the words that you always say
So that picture that you paintin' clear

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]

I'm crazy over you
I don't know what to do
I don't understand why I'm crazy over you (Ooh, ooh)
I don't know what to do

[Verse 1]
If I had to, I would give up everything just to feel and be with you
If I had to, I would pawn the ring you gave to me just to feed you
If I had to, I would give my very last breath just to help save you
And If I had to, I would tell a lie just because I know you are the truth

Ooh, I'd ride for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you
And I'll do anything that pleases you
Only you

[Verse 2]
If I had to, I would throw away my only wish just to prove to you
If I had to, I would die all alone living there without you
If I had to, I would go through all the pain again just to find you
If I had to, I'd surrender all my love just because I love you

Fake friends I call them "has-been"
Yeah, they lying on stuff
And it's okay if they don't show me love, no

I had to thank God 'cause he chose me
I'm still the same girl

[Verse 4: French Montana]
When I was dead broke there was nobody (Nobody)
My back to the walls, nobody (Nobody)
Still the same old nigga (Nigga)
Thirty new cars, thirty chains, oh nigga
Been real (Been real), count money (Count money)
Get it hot (Get it hot), oh la la
Been real (Been real), count money (Count money)
Get it hot (Get it hot), oh la la

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Chris Brown]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me (Off of me)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (Brap!)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders? (Brap! World on my)
Get off of me, (Brap! Off of me), get off of me (Brap!)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (I don't owe nobody)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
(Ow!)




[Intro]
It's like I'm lost
I don't know
But this feeling that I have about you
Will you ever know?

[Chorus]
Secretly (I'm so crazy)
I'm wanting you (I don't know what to do)
And I'm hoping you want me too (I gotta work it out to tell you)
I smell your scent (Tell you how I feel) across the room (When I see you)
And I can't wait to get next to you (My heart feels like it's gonna explode)

[Verse 1]
Whatever I see (When I look at you across the room)
Whatever I hear (I wonder if he notice me too)
Whatever I do (I just think about you for hours)
Oh, baby, and it's got me thinking of you (It's crazy)

[Chorus]
Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (You look so good to me)
I smell your scent across the room (So sexy, damn)
And I can't wait to get next to you (Do I look sexy to you?)

[Verse 2]
Whenever you speak (Haha)
Whenever you move (That's what I think about)
Whenever you breathe (That's just the way I feel)
Baby, let me touch you (I don't know) please

[Chorus]
Secretly (I need to tell you)
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (I got a thing with you)
I smell your scent across the room (Do you see me?)
And I can't wait to get next to you ('Cause I see you)
Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (It's crazy)
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you

[Outro]
You smell so good
I just wanna kiss you
I wanna lay with you
I don't know how to tell you

[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide!
Ha ha ha
With the mami, with the sexiest body
J.Lo, let's ride!

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
A piece of that sexy body

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I got the flow that took over the globe, yeah
I got the cribs on the island for sure, yeah
I got the jet fueled up, ready to go
I put my money where my mouth is
I got the bread to blow
Baby believe me, baby you need me
Don't deceive me, then we'll be straight
And whenever you see me
Baby just tease me
I like a little foreplay, yeah that's great
Now you're thinking that you know me
But you don't 'cause I do things these men won't
These boys act like they're ballers
But they ain't
I definitely do the things that they can't
I'm in my own world, girl, no rules, no laws
No thongs, no bras
Now show me that sexy body, baby, I wanna see it all


[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
A piece of that sexy body

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
S for the sex
E for the e in
X, forget about your ex
Y, 'cause baby, I'm up next
B for the best
O for the one
D 'cause I'm down
Y, yolo, done
Home run, grand slam
I am, the man
You're the biddy-bing-bing-bang-bang, that thang
Now I'm actin' a fool, girl ain't no rules
Why hit one when I can hit a few?
It's been like that since high school
If it ain't broke, why fix it? This shit, gon' gift it
Word to the wise; keep it long distance
Don't need assistance, so mind your business
I hit and run, but when it comes to a sexy body, you're the one


[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
Got a feeling that maybe this just was  meant to be
Let's go, oh
Wanna feel you come in close like you belong to me
There's one thing I don't know

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
A piece of that sexy body

[Verse 1]
The man on your own
Why don't you put some bass in your tone?
Can't you see that it is lonely
Taking care of, all day long?
You're making me leave
Shouldn't have gave me a reason to breathe
Definitely not, no, that's not what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so done with pleasing you, I'm so over needing you
All this space just gave me room so I could fly
What I thought would make me die makes me feel like I'm alive
Boy, you words don't carry weight to hold me down

[Chorus]
I'm still so good over you
I'm still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I'm still so good over you
I'm still good

[Verse 2]
The man on your own
Why don't you put some bass in your tone?
Can't you see that it is lonely
Taking care of, all day long?
You're making me leave
Shouldn't have gave me a reason to breathe
Definitely not, no, that's not what I mean


[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so done with pleasing you, I'm so over needing you
All this space just gave me room so I could fly
What I thought would make me die makes me feel like I'm alive
Boy, you words don't carry weight to hold me down

[Chorus]
I'm still so good over you
I'm still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I'm still so good over you
I'm still good
I'm still good
I'm still good

[Bridge]
I bet you think I need you
I'm telling you I don't, you lost your mind
I used to be so see-through
But now, I never let you on my mind
I'm worth a bunch of millions
But you be acting like your money's mine (Nice girl)
I'm on the Eiffel, chilling
I'll be damned if I let you blow my high
Baby, what you think about life
Without me by your side?
I bet you wanna get it right
But even if you get it right


[Chorus]
I'm still so good over you
I'm still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I'm still so good over you
I'm still good
I'm still good
I'm still good



[Verse 1]
Dime porque te me vas y nada puedo hacer
Que pecado cometi para marcharte asi, de mi
Se que esta es la ultima vez que me veras y te vere

[Chorus]
Ya no es facil olvidar, perdi la oportunidad
No me puedo perdonar, sigo mi camino
Y sigo sola, conmigo caminando a solas
Mi mundo se derrumba todo
Me queda seguir, esperar y cambiar y llorar y dejarlo todo
Quitarme el llanto de mis ojos
Alimentando esta ilusion y soportando este dolor

[Verse 2]
Caminar por las calles y ver
Que las cosas no pueden volver
Ver la gente a mi lado pasar
Sin que puedan y quieran pensar
Y tal vez sea una nueva estacion
Que me pone de nuevo en el rol
Protagonico fin de terror
Con el miedo de la involuntad
De mirarme y querer escapar
De creer y volver a caer
Del delirio de la decepcion
Y esta vez disparaste a matar

[Chorus]
Ya no es facil olvidar, perdi la oportunidad
No me puedo perdonar, sigo mi camino
Y sigo sola, conmigo caminando a solas
Mi mundo se derrumba todo
Me queda seguir, esperar y cambiar y llorar y dejarlo todo
Quitarme el llanto de mis ojos
Alimentando esta ilusion y soportando este dolor

[Bridge]
Ya no es facil olvidar, perdi la oportunidad
No me puedo perdonar, sigo mi camino

[Chorus]
Ya no es facil olvidar, perdi la oportunidad
No me puedo perdonar, sigo mi camino
Y sigo sola, conmigo caminando a solas
Mi mundo se derrumba todo
Me queda seguir, esperar y cambiar y llorar y dejarlo todo
Quitarme el llanto de mis ojos
Alimentando esta ilusion y soportando este dolor


[Black Rob]
Yo look clown I come through bully down
Keep thinkin that you hard take a look around
I got soldiers stationed up to bring pain
And when it go down my hoes do the same thing
We all in the same game, we all willin to bang
Ain't nobody going against the grain, so take aim
B.R.'s evasive, cut all the faces, catch all the cases, this real
You rather bet'cha life than face me
I mean I got this rap game locked with more cake than Tastee
Black the feindest, this title I hold I won't relinquish
And this type shit you shouldn't sting wish
And one phone call and I'll extinquish, I mean this you seen this
Blue steel fo-fo the caliber, Excalibur, Im'a destroy my next challenger
B. Rob high post MC, quick to spray Raid on the roach MC
So don't be apporachin me without the cross and rosary
Who this nigga 'pose to be, I blast him in the open beef
Damn Black, how you do that der?
'Cuz we..dont..care, I'll take 'em there

Chorus: Jennifer Lopez

Last night, I dreamed of some more dough
Some crystal, sixty thousand, and ten dimes of 'dro (I'll take 'em there)
Last night I realized I'm dreaming
Too late now, guess I'll finish what I started baby


[Black Rob]
Y'all niggas heard the first verse no doubt shit bangin
Verse two make sure none of y'all left hangin
Got honies lovin this shit too, one wit'choo
Long as you know my pants don't fit'choo
Money good look, understand why he shook
Shit I'm rich, face all up in the Guiness Book
Check, all the records I set, its major
Check, that the sets I wreck with flavor
Fuck that cajun, guns stay bond cock
?Boiler on lock? hold shit down like Fort Knox
Man, knock the rhyme unorthadox
What'cha barely understand, shit I deal with the L.O.X
Give me the props, Im tryin set a mark this year
And bring the equipment out to the parks this year
So y'all could see how it used to be
I'm lookin towards the future see
Black here to stay, its time y'all got used to me
Puff said Black ain't tryin to fit in
Up and down the coast can't count the spots I've been in
Put'cha bid in

Chours

[Black Rob]
I hit a ??? if my name was Teddy Bender
Hot beats and hot rhymes tossed in a blenda'
I want ch'all to feel hardcore, nothin tenda'
Blessed this mic for as long as I remember
Y'all can't see the Rob, uh-uhh, y'all must be stupid
If I owe Shawn Combs any money then I recouped it
I looped it, this fly shit from ?Nebogada?
Me and Yogi and Hard Pierre from You Dont Know Me
I dare you to come against me, run against me
Use your gun against me, you finito, finished
I've seen wild cats diminished, foldin for, Bad Boy's known to ball
Internationally, I'm sayin actually
I have to be the next cat to go and sell a million records casually
So, prepare yourself for the storm, Nineteen-nine-nine its on
And I'm just gettin warm


Chorus



[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
He's all right, he's all wrong
He's a player, he's a dog
He's my friend, he's my foe
I just can't leave him, I can't go
I got my reasons, got my pride
I got these kids, we got these ties
We had this love, I had these dreams
I'm falling apart at the seams

[Pre-Chorus]
He's my man when we're at home
And it can't hurt if I don't know
All his secrets, all his lies
I just keep pushing, out my mind
I wish that everybody would stop judging
Pointing fingers, it's cutting
My heart is broken up, I'm open, and feeling so bad
I've gotta make decisions
I'm strong, but who am I kidding?
I'll be okay, but this love is tearing me in half

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to be the one breaking up
I'm down on my knees, I'm praying for this love
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
I just don't think (Just don't think), that it's enough (It's enough)
I can feel, it getting colder
I'm afraid, of starting over

[Verse 2]
He makes me feel like a child
He makes me happy when he smiles
He makes me sad, he makes me mad
I wanna give him all I have
And I have tried to treat him good
Show support like I should
Did my part, he's my heart
And I've been faithful from the start

[Pre-Chorus]
He's my man when we're at home
And it can't hurt if I don't know
All his secrets, all his lies
I just keep pushing, out my mind
I wish that everybody would stop judging
Pointing fingers, it's cutting
My heart is broken up, I'm open, and feeling so bad
I've gotta make decisions
I'm strong, but who am I kidding?
I'll be okay, but this love is tearing me in half

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to be the one breaking up
I'm down on my knees, I'm praying for his love
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
I just don't think (Just don't think), that it's enough (It's enough)
I can feel, it getting colder
I'm afraid, of starting over

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
To save this life, we built together
We need another chance
It's like my whole life, and my existence
He holds in his hands, in his hands

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to be the one breaking up (Oh, yeah)
I'm down on my knees (Down on my knees), I'm praying for his love (For his love, yeah)
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
I just don't think (Just don't think), that it's enough (It's enough)
I can feel, it getting colder
The time has come, for starting over


[Intro]
Say, ha
Yeah, woo! Woo!

[Verse 1]
Through the bumpy roads, the others bite the dust
'Cause they be thinking they're in love when their in lust
But cliche breaking up so easy
I'm about to throw a curve ball, honey
People let the stormy weather push them out
But back against the road it's easy to be over
Don't sweat the little things, wake up
Stay together, it's a new break up

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep loving
Toe-to-toe, we so strong
And on and on, we up and running
Not a day goes by without dreaming
Not a thing goes out, just keep reaching
Through the storm, we stay warm
And on and on, we keep on loving

[Chorus]
The stars are in our favor (Yeah)
This time comes second nature (Oh)
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious (Serious)
'Cause romance is underrated (Oh, yeah)
Stay together, that's the new trend


[Verse 2]
Through the bumpy roads, the others bite the dust
And seems like everybody's giving up when
These days, breaking up's so cliche
Hear them screaming out, "Baby, no, please stay"
People always wanna always hurry up and wait for
Someone better than the person they won't stay for
They sweat the little things, wake up
Stay together, it's the new breakup

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep loving
Toe-to-toe, we so strong
And on and on, we up and running (Yeah, yeah)
Not a day goes by without dreaming
Not a thing goes out, just keep reaching
Through the storm, we stay warm
And on and on, we keep on loving (Yeah)

[Chorus]
The stars are in our favor
This time comes second nature (Second nature)
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious (Serious)
'Cause romance is underrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Hey, yeah


[Bridge]
And though there'll be the nights of fights and we must face it
It's like a roller coaster, ups and downs will come
As long as we hold tight and never act complacent
Remember how we built this, then our love is never done

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep loving (Keep loving)
Toe-to-toe, we so strong
And on and on, we up and running
Not a day goes by without dreaming (Yeah)
Not a thing goes out, just keep reaching
Through the storm, we stay warm
And on and on, we keep on loving

[Chorus]
The stars are in our favor
This time comes second nature (Ooh)
Heartbreaks are overrated (Overrated)
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious (Oh)
'Cause romance is underrated (Ooh)
Stay together, that's the new trend

[Outro]
Hey, ha
Ooh, uh
Ooh

[Intro]
Step into my world
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Like a moth to a flame, you know you're drawn to me
I know you better than you know yourself, baby
Why do you try to resist what you want, honey?
I want you to give me what I need, listen closely

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you to hold on me
I need you to kiss on me
Feel your body next to me
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give into me
Want all of you, everything
Ecstasy is what I will bring you if you just

[Chorus]
Step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams and the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only, ooh, step into my world


[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and let your feelings now take over
It's alright, I'm intoxicating you though you're sober
You inside, the thought alone is so overbearing
Boy, tonight you just follow my lead from here and

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you to hold on me
I need you to kiss on me
Feel your body next to me
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give into me
Want all of you, everything
Ecstasy is what I will bring you if you just

[Chorus]
Step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams and the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only, ooh, step into my world

[Bridge]
Where there's no reality
Time itself means nothing
It's so hypnotizing
It brings you to a state of natural high
See how my words, they get to you?
Creates the lift that's haunting you
Yes, that's it, hold onto it
Ooh, welcome to my world


[Interlude]
My world
Where desires flow deep
Fantasies

[Chorus]
Ooh, step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities (Oh-oh-oh)
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams (Odyssey of dreams) and the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only, ooh, step into my world

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh



[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
When I sleep  I have dreams about the way we used to kiss
'Bout the way you used to hold me
And say nothing would ever harm me
When we first met, oh, how you charmed me
Made me smile when I was down
Big pimping around the town, you and me
Whenever they'd see you, they'd see me
A lover and a friend to me you were, how did it end?
How it hurts to not have you in my life
When I wanted to be your wife

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know what you have 'til it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

[Chorus]
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one (The only one)
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one

[Verse 2]
A good man you were to me, always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me (Oh, oh)
Didn't matter, what, when, or where, you were there
I never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start
When I just wanted to get some attention (Sorry)
And I'm sorry, baby for bitching
If I could take back the words
That I said to make you leave
I'd be down on bended knees
Asking you to please forgive me

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know what you have 'til it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

[Chorus]
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one (The only one)
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one

[Bridge]
All of the good times we had together (Together)
Do they mean something to you?
Do you ever wish we never split?
'Cause I still got love for you

[Chorus]
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you (Gave my heart to you)
And baby, you're the only one
There's other men than you (There's other men than you)
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one
Still, I still got love for you (Still got love)
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you (I love you)
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one




[Verse 1]
Do you remember what you said to me the day I met you?
Like yesterday, I still can hear your voice, you promised to be
Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there
Well, it's been a while and here we are looking back on times that we've shared

[Pre-Chorus]
I still imagine us being young and so in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Feels like it's always just been us

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around (Still around, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days
You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made
I sing your favorite song inside my head when you're not with me
Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
I still imagine us being young and still in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Makes me smile, we're still in love

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around

[Verse 3]
Looking back through all the years
You remember the first time I went to your house?
And your father looked at me like I had three heads?
I'll never forget the day
We were so in love
Looking back through all the years
You were so beautiful and so young
I never will forget the day you came into my life and what you said to me
I can't believe you're still mine, that's crazy
I love you

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me (We were in the park, holding hands)
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever (Never let you down, my baby)
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around (Still around, yeah)
I remember we were in the park (Ooh)
Holding hands and you said to me (Ooh)
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl and
You would stay with me forever (Ooh)
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around (Still around, yeah)




[Verse 1]
Your relation to me
Feeds my empty existence
I guess I choose what to see
Because I'm feeling resistance
So turn the lights on below
The time we have is too precious
You say that you'll never go
I know that lying is infectious now
So don't let me down

[Chorus]
I'm breaking my own rules today, ohh
I know that I should walk away, ohh
I'm falling again for someone who doesn't feel alright
That's the story of my life

[Verse 2]
I thought you were ready to be
The start of my happy ending
Sometimes I choose what to see
Forget what I've been defending

Before the day fades to day
There comes a break in the weather
I made you say goodbye
Because I can't say forever, now
So don't let me down, no

[Chorus]
I'm breaking my own rules today, ohh
I know that I should walk away, ohh
I'm falling again for someone who doesn't feel alright
That's the story of my life

[Bridge]
One in a million
But if you are ready to listen
I know that I can be stubborn
Maybe it's me but I've been too blind to see

[Chorus]
I'm breaking my own rules today, ohh
I know that I should walk away, ohh
I'm falling again for someone who doesn't feel alright
That's the story of my life

[Outro]
Keep walking, I keep walking
Keep walking, I keep walking
Keep walking, I keep walking
That's the story of my life




[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Black bottles, black models
Cuban cigars, Domincanos
Colombianos, it's [?]
100 dope boys on the sofa
I'm going fishin' with Versace on
Stars on the roof for the ambiance
Dug up some more hundreds, fought a few cases
Now we in the club throwing blue faces
Used to see Papi at the [?]
Now I'm crack sittin' on gold toilets
Pure heroine brings more spoils
Large, you people never be royal

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
You can buy me way more bottles then them other sections
Leave 1000 dollar tip, what blessin'
All eyes on us, ain't nobody in the club lookin' at your direction
So let me ask you one question
Do we look like we're stressin'? Cause we ain't
Do we look like we're stressin'? Cause we ain't
Do we look like we're stressin'? Cause we ain't

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Coke [?] more opus
Break up the makeup, we got motives
I market America, that teamwork
Three keys in my sleep, now that's dream work
It's the Hublot show
Seven figures on the wrist like you don't know
The haters lookin' at me cause the mommies lookin' at me
Fed's lookin' at me, all the snitches lookin' happy
Fo' hunnid on the race, that's hella dough
Just to see the stars with no telescope
I got the pussy wetter than that yayo
Get it off of the block, that J. Lo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]

But she gone be in La Marina all summer
And she gone be up in my tub half naked
And I just sold the plug [?]

He could be the hottest man alive
But he can't hold a flame up to you and I
'Cause I'm so much better when I'm standing by your side

You're something like a drug
Impossible to stop me when I'm tripping off of love
I always run back cause I never get enough
'Cause boy, you're my everything
That's why I need you in my life
And no, it ain't a thing
I reach up in the sky, grab a cloud and make it rain
And there's nothing, nothing that I can do
'Cause you make me feel like

[Chorus]
I can stop a train if I want to
Can't nothing get in my way
'Cause I got you
And baby, we can rule the world
'Cause with you, I'm stronger, stronger

[Verse 3]
Baby, you make me better daily
Even when no one else is around
And can't nobody show me all the love that you give me
And that's why I'm gonna hold you down
So when you want me
I'll give my all
'Cause you be there to catch me whenever I start falling
When I'm with you, I get stronger everyday
That's why I say (oh oh oh)

[Verse 1]
Said she gave you everything
She broke her back to be what you need
I tried so long to just compete
Can't take no more, losing sight of me
I'm letting you know this can't go on
This one-way street, I'm walking alone
This time I'm breaking free
I'm gonna find me

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me


[Verse 2]
Don't want you to think that I'm selfish
I'm just sick of your one track mess
If you can't meet me halfway
I think it's time that you be on your way
I love you, but I can't baby you
If it's your mama you want, you know just what to do
I looked in the mirror every day
I saw myself fading away
You trying to mold me into her
I loved you so I put you first
But I can't live my life this way

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

[Verse 3]
I was so lost in love before
I couldn't see the light
But now I'm strong enough to leave you now
So you better treat me right
Don't want to throw it all away
So, baby, here's your last chance
Don't wanna fight with you but I need more of you
Give me all or it's the end


[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it (I won't)
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be, I tried)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50 (No, no, no)
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

[Bridge]
I cooked, I cleaned, I washed your clothes (You know I did)
You were so mean, so ungrateful (So ungrateful)
At night I cried so many times
Tell me how could you go diss me (How could you go diss me)
When you know one day you'll miss me (Know one day you'll miss me)
If it can't be 50/50
Then, baby, that's not me

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive (Baby, that's not me)
Won't tolerate no more, that's it (Baby, that's not me)
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50 (I can't, I won't)
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me (I can't, I won't)
'Cause, baby, that's not me
I can't sit and be passive  (Oh)
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be, oh)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)

Baby, stop and think (Yeah)
What you and I could be (I could be)
Together, I know we (I know we) can be perfectly complete (So, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Baby, I can give you anything (Give you all my love)
If you promise to be with me (Yes, I can)
I promise I can make you happy
'Cause that's the way our love should be (And it ain't nobody)
No one could love you better anyway (Not like me)
You'll never find another close to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I promise I can make you happy
And that's the way our love should be


[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Why are you tryna deny
Me of the loving that's mine?
Just let it go (Go)
Let me take control ('Trol)
Boy, I got just what you want
And all the love you need
Once you grab a hold (Hold)
You won't let me go (Go), no

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I won't stop (I won't stop) until I get what I want (Everything I need)
So what am I to do? (What am I to do?)
'Cause what I want is you (When all I want is you)
Baby, stop and think (Oh, no)
What you and I could be (What we could be)
Together, I know we can be perfectly complete (Perfectly complete, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Baby, I can give you anything (I can give you all)
If you promise to be with me (Yes, I can)
I promise I can make you happy (I know)
'Cause that's the way our love should be (Our love should be)
No one could love you better anyway (Ooh, oh)
You'll never find another close to me (Not quite like me)
I promise I can make you happy (Oh)
'Cause that's the way our love should be (Baby)
Baby, I can give you anything (Anything you want from me)
If you promise to be with me (Please stay with me)
I promise I can make you happy (Oh, oh)
That's the way our love should be (Woah, oh)
No one could love you better anyway (Haha, haha)
You'll never find another close to me
I promise I can make you happy
'Cause that's the way our love should be


[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Darkchild]
If I let my actions speak (Yeah)
I guarantee you believe (Believe)
How much I really do love you (How much I do love you)
If I could spend my whole life (Spend my life, yeah)
Just looking into your eyes
I'll be happy just knowing you're with me (You're with me, my love)
Yeah, uh

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Darkchild]
Baby, I can give you everything (Anything)
If you promise to be with me (Yeah, be with me)
I promise I can make you happy (Shake it, shake it)
'Cause that's the way our love should be (Said you should be with me, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it)
No one could love you better anyway (Baby, yeah)
You'll never find another close to me (Shake it)
I promise I can make you happy (Jennifer)
'Cause that's the way our love should be, baby (Darkchild, come on)
Baby, I can give you anything (Ooh, baby)
If you promise to be with me (Ooh, baby)
I promise I can make you happy (Ooh)
'Cause that's the way our love should be
No one could love you better anyway (You should be loving me)
You'll never find another close to me ('Cause you'll find no one like me)
I promise I can make you happy (And I know this is the way)
That's the way our love should be (That our love should be)
Baby, I can give you anything
If you promise to be with me
I promise I can make you happy
That's the way our love should be
No one could love you better anyway
You'll never find another close to me
I promise I can make you happy
And that's the way our love should be


[Outro]
Baby, I can give you anything



[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you gain what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

[Verse 1]
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our mind
You knew how I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me

[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

[Verse 2]
Now looking back on all we planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to our those questions can be?

[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you gain what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

[Outro]
Do you know?




[Verse 1]
Taking away the fact that I care about you, it's just your way
So sweet, everything seems right around you
Did you know that you had this calming way about you when you touch?
And I wanna know if I could be your girl

[Chorus]
The one put her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else is, I could see it (Your girl)
The one who knows when it's under control
The one who knows your favorite song (Your girl)
The one you want when you're feeling lost
The one you place no one above

[Verse 2]
I'm happy to say in a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile when you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows, I really feel I'll always be your girl

[Chorus]

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & will.i.am]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

[Refrain: will.i.am]
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...

[Verse 1: Will.i.am]
I'ma go hard, hard to the core
Hard like motherfucking liquid swords
Harder than worldwide stadium tours
I am the future, DeLorean doors
Willy survive, never deceased
I don't think I'ma ever gon' rest in peace
I'ma kill the game, leave the rest in pieces
Now everybody want my recipes
Tell a jealous chicken
I don't know what the beef is
I'm just making money for my grankids' nieces
I'ma work hard, that's my thesis
This beat is the shit, feces (Uh)
Pardon me ma'am, I'ma go dumb
Smart.i.am, I'm complicated, Hard.i.am
I end the beginning, then start it again

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & will.i.am]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

[Refrain: will.i.am]
Ooh, ooh
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...
Ooh, ooh
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...

[Verse 2: Will.i.am]
You can get that, or you can get this
You can call a demon, I'ma call Jesus
You can get a curse, you can get a cross
You can go to work, or you could be the boss
I'ma be the owner, be a thought donor
I'ma go hard, like a motherfuckin' boner
I'ma make the beat put the people in a coma
You can be a geek or be a rolling stoner (Uh)
I woke up in the morning
Hard like morning wood in the morning
Woke up thinking about microphoning
E.T. own the mic, phone the homeland (Uh)
I wait out like NASA
I'm way over here, I done passed ya
I get stacks of cash, you get cashews
I go hard, statues (Uh)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & will.i.am]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & will.i.am]
Now let me take this time to say
I don't wanna lead you on
You can go hard or you can go home
Well I, I know it is a lot to take
I don't wanna lead you on
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
Ooh, ooh
Wait a minute, I'ma make it a little harder
I'ma make it a little harder
Give it to you a little harder
This is hard

[Interlude: will.i.am]
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh

[Verse 3: Mick Jagger]
Hard like a rock 'n roll
Time bomb's ticking, explode
Baby, this is dynamo
Better move back now, it's 'bout to blow
Hard like geometry, and trigonometry
This is crazy, psychology
Get it, baby, I'm 'bout to win
Watch out now, I'm going in

[Chorus: Mick Jagger]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard




[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
It always feels like a love to me in the beginning
My mind is just a mirror of the way my heart wants it to be
I hope to see everything in his eyes
'Cause that's where it starts with the truth and the lies
And I cannot hide my emotions
You cannot hide your intentions from me

[Chorus]
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is

[Verse 2]
And everything you do to me, it'll be done to you
And everything I put you through, well then, I'll go through
But I'm willing to take that chance (Take that chance)
For this type of romance
Its special, baby (Uh)
I always look for love to be, so exciting
But you can't force it, I'm finding
In reality, chemistry is everything

[Chorus]
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
What your perception is
Of our connection is simply perfection
And it's the same thing
If you're accepting it, then I'm accepting it
Simple perfection, and its just the same thing
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

[Chorus]
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is (The way it is, what you're saying is)
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is (It's just the way it is, what you say it is)
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is


[Verse 1]
I believe in never let my strip get hotter
Than something I can get out of, one that heats up on me
I told 'em this would be a one time dance
Meaning one time chance after I said that, oh
That's when he got close to me
All the other music stopped but the violin
Conversation, one dance, sip a bottle of the best
Now I'm asking myself, "What has he done to me?"

[Pre-Chorus]
This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck to come and get me

[Chorus]
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it 'cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know if I'm going or coming
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Didn't have to know from your body put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale on me

[Verse 2]
Gotta call a cab if I don't need gonna have me
With every young stunna in the hood wanna have me
Uh, so much of him I couldn't surrender
'Cause I know where this could end up
And with that right now I can't play
I know I drive him loco but that's just the way
You make a mama's hips go


[Pre-Chorus]
This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck to come and get me

[Chorus]
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it 'cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know if I'm going or coming
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Didn't have to know from your body put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale on me

[Verse 3]
That's why I fly [?]
Or that deuce deuce chrome el Camino
Hope the world is really ready for some fly Latinos
We the chief like Babe Ruth and The Great Bambino
Now we didn't really come here to burn nobody
All I wanna do is drink and dance with shawty
There's a legend in the house, here to rock the party
You can toss, drink, blaze and like there's no tamari
Ops, I'm in my Maina with Carlos Santana
Ops, it's Ronnie Ray all day with J hot as a sauna
We in the building and we feelin' like a 100 degrees
I got a fly chicanita and she's stuntin' with me, so right here


[Chorus]
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it 'cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know if I'm going or coming
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Didn't have to know from your body put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale on me

[Outro]
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it 'cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know if I'm going or coming

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Verse 1]
Like a puppet on a string
You came and took control of me
Would've given anything
To be your one and only
Filled my head with fantasies
Of what one day you would give to me
Full of hope for what could be
I sat and waited patiently

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away (Oh)
I never should've been with you anyway (I never should have been with you, baby)
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way (It's too late, oh)
You say that you had to go away (You had to go away)
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late


[Verse 2]
For a time you were for me
Everything that I could need
Gave me time and diamond rings
But something else was missing
You never stayed the whole night through
I suffered, prayed, and cried for you
After all that we've been through
I feel I never even knew you

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway (Oh, no)
And now you say you wanna stay (It's too late, baby)
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way (Oh, yes, I am)
You say that you had to go away (You had to go away)
I never really loved you anyway (Ooh)
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Bridge]
There's no need to call me on the phone
I don't wanna hear from you no more
No need (No need), don't call (Don't call)
Don't be a fool and stand outside my door
'Cause being the woman that I am
I got to go on with other plans
Woah-oh-oh-oh, yes
Oh, yes
Ooh, ooh-ooh


[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away (You have to go away)
I never should've been with you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way (It's too late, oh, yes it is, baby)
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway (I never loved you)
And now you say you wanna stay (It's too late)
It's too late, it's too late (It's too late)

[Outro]
It's too late, it's too late
(First you say that you have to go away)
It's too late, it's too late, oh
(I never should've been with you anyway)
Ooh
(And now you say you wanna stay)
You wanna stay, but it's too late, baby
(It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way)
(You say that you had to go away)
Oh
(I never really loved you anyway)
I never loved you anyway
(And now you say you wanna stay)
I never loved you anyway
(It's too late, it's too late)
I never loved you anyway
(First you say that you have to go away)
Oh, yeah
(I never should've been with you anyway)
Oh, baby
(And now you say you wanna stay)
Why'd you have to go away from me?
(It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way)
(You say that you had to go away)
Oh
(I never really loved you anyway)
I never loved you
(And now you say you wanna stay)
I never loved you anyway
(It's too late, it's too late)

[Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
This love is so dangerous
But I kind of like the thrill
It's like a sugar rush
It's all in the way you make me feel
I didn't see you coming, but you broke me down
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos
One smile, and oh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
I gotta admit you're fly
And I love it how you talk, babe
Getting all in my mind
Running it like a field play
I didn't see you coming
But you broke me down
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Don't you walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos, and

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux


[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
I, deep down know I should be good
I ain't blind, you're the kind of guy
That always got all these girls running after you
Do I entertain or play with you? Or just be cool?
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos
One smile, and oh
Don't sleep, I think I'ma burn too fast
So close, wrapped up in the heat of love
I'm having fantasies of how it's gonna be
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos, still

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux


[Verse 4: Nas]
Yo, got Henny in the cup, Jenny knows what's up
She with a real one, not pretending to be tough
Got three cases, might have a warrant I don't know about
Beef I don't know about, weed I can't go without
My money used to pile up every beginning of the month
Unconditional love, in the beginning it was lust
Hustler, shooter, was a dealer on the block
Now my future's on top, no longer dealing with the thots
I don't go nowhere without the handle
Like I heard Lil' Boosie was out in Louisiana
Got friends in the feds, some dead over drugs
Fucking with me is high-risk but she still in love (We in love, baby)
Benny Medina might wanna pay me to leave ya
I'm bad for your image, the ghetto menacing diva
'Cause some say Nas is trouble
We all in, just ignore them nice guys is boring, I got you

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux

[Verse 1]
I was down for the count
Feeling like I've come to the end
Nothing really mattered
Nothing left for me to mend
Ooh, but then you came, and I still couldn't see
'Til you tore down every wall in me
How you healed me with your patience
If it's all I ever do, I'll never stop loving you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
And there ain't doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you
I was fading, but you pulled me through
'Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die
But there ain't no doubt about it, it's love, and I have found it
Feel the beat again, stronger than before
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more

[Verse 2]
Was in place full of pain
With a broken down heart in despair
He took away my feelings
And made it hard for me to care
Ooh, but then you crashed through the door, to my soul
Put back all the pieces and made me whole
I was living in the past, oh no
Now I'm never looking back, I'm never looking back


[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
And there ain't doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you
I was fading, but you pulled me through
'Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die
But there ain't no doubt about it, it's love, and I have found it
Feel the beat again, stronger than before
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more

[Bridge]
Whatever you want me to
I'm gonna see you through
All I ever do
Never stop loving you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe (Hey, yay)
And there ain't doubt about it, there ain't doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you
I was fading, but you pulled me through (Fading but you pulled me through)
'Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt (I was hurt), thought I'd die (Hey, yay)
And there ain't doubt about it, there's just no doubt (I'm much stronger)
Feel the beat again, stronger than before (So much stronger than before)
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more

[Verse 1]
Is this a warning?
My heart beatin' on an offbeat
Is this a caution
That I can't get enough for you and me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?

Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

[Verse 1]
Now somehow you feel left out
Somehow you're feeling doubt
Got an inch but took a mile, oh no
Right now your body's in need
Can't replace what you had in me
My words are cutting deep, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
You've watched me fall, now I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I loved you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine

[Chorus]
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I gave you my all, but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, baby, I'm the villain of your love


[Post-Chorus]
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

Baby, I'm the villain, baby, I'm the villain

[Verse 2]
Oh, now you get the picture
Oh oh, now you wanna fix her
Oh oh, now you're screaming, "Let's go back"
I ain't having that
But now my love ain't around
It's behind walls that won't come down
But now you wanna show up and turn my sour sweet
You gon' miss me

[Pre-Chorus]
You've watched me fall, now I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I loved you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine

[Chorus]
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, I'm the villain

I gave you my all, but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, baby, I'm the villain of your love

Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

I'm the villain, I'm the villain of your love

Caught in me, lost in you
Head spinnin'

I'm helpless [?]

Play your heart like a violin
You pull the strings and you pull me in

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on


[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long

I feel so lucky indeed
They can keep on talking
It don't matter to me cause
We are, we are family
Family, we are, we are

[Talking: Wanda Sykes & John Leguizamo]
Ham and Cheese
No! It's we are family
Nah


[Verse 2: Keke Palmer, Queen Latifah& John Leguizamo]
Ok, so the links in our chain makes us strange
But really they make us stronger
And I wouldn't replace not a thing
Mother or father (Go Manny)
Cause we

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & Jennifer Lopez]
Cause we come from everywhere (Whoa, Oh)
Searching for ones to care
Somehow we found it here
We found us a home

[Chorus: All & Ester Dean]
We are, we are
Not your ordinary fami-mily
But we can all agree that
We are, we are
Close as close can be (Be, Oh)

[Bridge: Keke Palmer, Drake, Ester Dean]
We are are are are (We are)
We are are are are (We are)

We are, we are
Family
Family
Family
We are, we are

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Verse 1]
The way you looked at me tells me you're sorry
You walked by me whispering you love me
When I tried to hold you tight you pulled away
But you wanted me to stay, instead you ran away
Baby, talk to me, let's stop playing games
Don't turn away from me, just look me straight in the eyes
Don't try to sweet talk me with those nasty words you say
Baby, just be real and tell me how you feel

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Together)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Verse 2]
The way you tricked me you know that wasn't right, ooh
You tried to fix it but all we did was fight
Because I gave you everything I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight, we got to compromise
Baby, talk to me and tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me and let me feel the vibe you're on
Come lay your head on me and everything will be alright
But we must communicate, tomorrow it could be too late


[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out (Talk to me, baby)
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Bridge]
'Cause I love you, boy, and I need you here
Together we can make this thing work out
To think about what we could miss
It makes me want to lose my mind
Talk to me
Come on, come on, come on
Talk to me
Oh
Ooh
Oh, oh, come on
Make me wanna dream, baby

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Baby, talk to me, baby)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talk to me, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Baby)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talk to me, baby, talk to me, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Mmm, mmm, together)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talk to me, baby, talk to me, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talking to you, talking to you, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Mmm, mmm)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talking to you, baby, talking to you, baby)


[Outro]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Intro]
C'mon man, I need something that I can move to
You needa give me some of that funk
Yeah, uh, yeah, woo
Yeah, uh, woah, uh
Uh, uh, woah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woah)

[Verse 1]
Pulled up at the red light
Cutie popped up on my left side
Window down, waiting for my reply
Not a word, I saw it in his eyes
Tell me something good, baby
He said, "Whatever you want to do" (For real? Uh)
He pulled to the curb, houses flash by (Woo!)
I got out with the catwalk shy (Catwalk shy)
Short skirt, golden brown thighs
Gucci heels, four inch high
He touched my face
Smiled and said, "Whatever you want to do" (Catch ya)

[Chorus]
Now I, said I usually need some time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
Maybe we need tonight
Whatever you want


[Verse 2]
We sipping, music all loud
Conversation, your lollypop mouth
You open up, sweet things come out
Whisper to me, what you talking about?
I said, "I think you know"
He said, "Whatever you want to do" (Woo!)
You stand up, taking my breath (Taking my breath)
It's your song so you do it two steps (Do it two steps)
I turned away, moved my hips slow (Move so slow)
Your thoughts, fully exposed
Now we better stop playing
I said, "Boy, whatcha gonna do?" (Hey)

[Chorus]
Now I, oh I, usually take my time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
You and I need tonight

[Bridge]
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)


[Interlude]
Uh, uh, uh, so good
Look at you, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on
Yeah, yeah, woo
Whatever you want to do, yeah

[Chorus]
Now I, normally take my time to get inside
So I, I don't know why it feels so right
So maybe we need tonight
Baby, we need, hey, hey, yeah

[Outro]
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want



[Verse 1]
Whatever you don't know
Baby, I will teach you
Anywhere you go
Know my love can reach you
Not a wall too high
Or a mountainside
Could keep me from seeing you

[Verse 2]
Whenever you're too tired
I could give you power
Go the extra mile
In your darkest hour
Any day or night
Call my name and I
I'll come running to be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll be fierce as a tiger
If anyone tries to fight ya
But I'll be soft as a lamb
When you're in my hands
I can bend
However I need to

[Chorus]
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
My fears and my flaws
You stand through it all
That's what I call love

[Verse 4]
I will understand
When you need space
I will hold your hand
When you're in pain
I'll be patient and pause
Most relationships
Require a give and take

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will never let my ego
Nor the words of other people
Get in the way
Or stop from saying
How much I care and I need you

[Chorus]
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
My fears and my flaws
You stand through it all
That's what I call love

[Bridge]
For better or for worse
That's what I call love...baby
It's more than just a word
Let me show you my love...baby

[Chorus 2]
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
My fears and my flaws
You stand through it all
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
That's what I call love

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
People told me I should write a love song
"Girl, you sound so angry, you could use some variation"
But I'm lonely, negative relations
I've been hurt so many times, I don't have the patience

[Pre-Chorus]
But I've wished for so long
For someone to come and show me, lead by example
'Cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age, I'm so tired of the game
(I) I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way?

[Chorus]
What if I never find, and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same, status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
'Cause if you told me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely (What is love?)
Please, show me (What is love?)

[Verse 2]
I've had blind dates hooked up with some real flakes
I've gone out with church boys, musicians are the worst
I've tried so hard, 'cause I'm just so die hard
Tried my best to play the part, wish you could see inside

[Pre-Chorus]
But I've wished for so long
For someone to come and show me, lead by example
'Cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age, I'm so tired of the game
(I) I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way?

[Chorus]
What if I never find, and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same, status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
'Cause if you told me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely (What is love?)
Please, show me (What is love?)

[Interlude]
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na (What is love?)
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na

[Bridge]
I've been alone for the past three years on Valentine's Day
Christmas is no exception, birthday's with naughty presents
Been back and forth, same action, I just need this to happen
I'll be singing love's praises, if you would show me

[Chorus]
What if I never find, and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same, status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
'Cause if you told me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely (What is love?)
Please, show me

[Outro]
Na na na na, na na na na na na (What is love? What is love?)
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na (What is love? What is love?)
Na na na na, na na na na na na (What is love? What is love?)
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na (What is love? What is love?)
Na na na na, na na na na na na (What is love?)
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na

(First Chorus)
Oh what's going on
What's going on
Yeah what's going on
What's going on


[Ja Rule]
What's going on in a world filled with pain
Where's the love for which we pray
What's going on
When our children can't play
Homeless can't eat
There's got to be a better way
What's going on
When we politically blind
Can't see the signs of endangered times
What's going on

[Nelly Furtado]
Ah ah tell me
What's goin' on in the world today
I'd rather be dead
Than turn my head away
We got a first world vision
Too comfy to lift up our hands in the air
And cry for a switch

[Michael Stipe]
Father, father

[P. Diddy]
Father help us, come on

[Nelly]
What's going on 'cross seas
Every minute a child dies by this disease
In record numbers indeed
Got mommas crying out please
My baby hold on
My child ain't done nothing wrong
Still I want to holler
Ask them why they don't bother
Oh no, oh no
Make me turn to my father
And ask him why they all got a trapped soul

[Nas]
I can feel what was bothering Marvin
Why his words forever remain
Dealing with these modern day problems
'Cause of ignorance surrounding me and my constituents
Too many infected
Too many lives diminishing
Nobody say Protestants, Jews, Blacks, and Whites, Latinos and
Asians
Pray together
Less fight
We better unite
As genocide chemical war
And the rich and the poor
Know that God delivers a cure

[Eve]
It's a shame our reality is devastating
People praying for a cure
Dying while they're waiting
Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it
All the kids with dreams
Won't get the chance to chase it
Makes me sad
Think about the lives they would've had
Think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads
How can we sit back and not try to make it right
We gotta come together
We gotta fight for life

[Fred Durst]
Somebody tell me what's going on
(What's going on)
We got human beings using humans for a bomb
But everyone wanna live
Don't nobody really want to die
You feeling me, right?
I can't be watching people die
(die)
And watching people cry
Let me break it down for a minute
If there's enough room here for you and for me
There's plenty of room for some humanity

What's going on...[repeat]

We gotta fight for life

[Lil' Kim]
Uh uh uh uh
See I come from the streets
A world with racism and poverty
It's hard to make peace
Little girl with big dreams
You don't have to settle
We gone get out the ghetto
We fight but still things ain't right
Too many dying
Lord knows I keep trying
You don't know the pain I feel
I miss you B.I.G
Let's find a cure for A.I.D.S
Oh

What's going on...[repeat]



[Verse 1: Trey Songz & Jennifer Lopez]
Standing here, all at once
All the words run dry
Something's changed, can't explain
And I can't deny

[Pre-Chorus 1: Trey Songz]
Turning in circles and blurring the lines of the unspoken
It's calling us tonight

[Chorus: Both]
I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination
I swear I'll try
Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you, faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light

[Verse 1: Trey Songz & Jennifer Lopez]
Close your eyes, when you dream
That's where I will be
Say it's true (It's true)
Say you do (I do)
Say you do believe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Both]
The greatest adventures are waiting so patiently
The angels are calling us tonight

[Chorus: Both]
I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination
I swear I'll try
Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you, faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light

[Bridge: Trey Songz & Jennifer Lopez]
Every shape and all the colors
All the love from all the lovers
Never could express just what you mean to me
Turning in circles and blurring the lines
Every word in every sentence
Doesn't seem to make a difference
Nothing can explain just what you mean to me

[Chorus: Both]
Oh, no, I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination
I swear I'll try
Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you, faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light

[Outro: Trey Songz & Jennifer Lopez]
Every star that's ever fallen
Knows the way to where we're going
Now I really know just what you mean to me




[Verse 1]
I just met infatuation
It's something in his smile
Now my obsession can't stand the thoughts of you and I
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet
Before I know it, I got you pushing up on me

[Pre-Chorus]
On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

[Chorus]
Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin' it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jerk
I'm making that thang twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doin' what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ahh

[Verse 2]
Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now let's make it a sight to see, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

[Chorus]
Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin' it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jerk
I'm making that thang twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doin' what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ahh

[Bridge]
We're flashing pictures
Kodak moment memories
Look at the flickers
Sparks on my camera screen
The buried treasure
Come with me and we will find
Create a perfect world, just for you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

[Chorus]
Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin' it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jerk
I'm making that thang twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doin' what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ahh

[Breakdown]
Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now let's make it a sight to see, baby

[Outro]
On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby


[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry no more
I'd give anything for you to come and help me perfect it
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry
Wanna feel like I'm brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you
Ain't no other way, they had to
I'ma always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Rick Ross]
Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry no more (Oh)
Just want you to know my name by the time we exit
Wanna feel like I'm brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you (Uh)
I don't wanna worry no more

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
The feeling that you give me is a coke rush (Uh)
Addicted to fast money, white Lamborghini (Woo!)
My name ring bells, authorities wanna see me (Boss)
Born king, I swore she was Nefertiti
Never been to Egypt, try to stay up out of debt (Ah!)
IRS is watching, they follow us on my neck (Yeah)
Still onto me but I'm only coming correct
This audio is gems, my niggas wanna collect
We the biggest in the game so let's just give us respect
Dance like a star, ass shake like a car
She really something special, I can tell from afar
Eyes on the check, 8-figures, feelin' best (Woo!)
Hustle on the corner, Givenchy be the finesse (Woo!)
Ex-drug dealer but still got his connects (Ah), yes (Haha)


[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected (Oh, oh)
I don't wanna worry no more (Oh)
Just want you to know my name by the time we exit
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry no more (Oh)
I don't wanna worry (Oh)
I'ma always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya (Oh)
I'ma always hold it down for ya
Move around for ya
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry
I don't wanna worry no more (Ooh)
Hold it down for ya
I'ma move around for ya
I don't wanna worry no more
Hold it down for ya
Every time I come around for ya
I'ma always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya
Do anything that you can, to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry
I don't wanna worry no more

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez]
(Oh-oh-oh)

[Intro]
Woah, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Guess I should've shut my mouth
But I had to get it out
So much for being headstrong
Now I'm going halfway out my mind
I know I was out of line
No scratch that, I was dead wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Know I shoulda let it go
But I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone
But, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back
If I knew all I'd be left with is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas 'Cause you're gone

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning
It's getting out of control
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone


[Verse 2]
Heaven knows if you were here
I'd be all up in your ear
Least you could do is answer your phone
'Cause I realized my mistake
And baby, I'll do what it takes
If I could just get you one and one

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoulda let it go
But I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone
But, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back
If I knew all I'd be left with is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas 'Cause you're gone

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning
It's getting out of control
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone


[Bridge]
I know I pushed you out
Running off at the mouth
Saying all the wrong things
Calling you out your name
I was unpredictable
I was so emotional
But I swear I'm gonna do better (Yeah)
Can we get this back together again?

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning (Ooh, oh)
It's getting out of control (Out of control)
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight (I don't wanna fight)
I don't care who's right (I don't care who's right)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning
It's getting out of control
I'm backing down this time (Backing down), I don't wanna fight (I don't wanna fight)
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
I'm wrong when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
So wrong when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm wrong when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Hear me)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone


[Outro]
So wrong, hear me
Come back, it seems so long

Woah, oh, oh, uh

[Verse 1]
Why'd you tell me this?
Were you looking for my reaction?
What do you need to know?
Don't you know I'll always be your girl?

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own

[Chorus]
You belong to me
Tell her, tell her you were fooling
You belong to me
You don't even know her
You belong to me
Tell her that I love you
You belong to me

[Verse 2]
You belong to me
Can it be funny, that you're not sure?
You belong to me
Thought we'd close the book and lock the door

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own, of my own
And I can tell, I can tell, darling


[Chorus]
Tell her
You belong to me
Tell her that I love her
You belong to me

You belong to me
Tell her she don't even know you
